The Plateau Chapter of the All Progressives Congress ( APC), has described the death of Mr Emmanuel Nanle, the Director of Press Affairs to Gov. Simon Lalong as a “colossal loss.” Mr Latep Dabang, the state party chairman, said this in a statement on Thursday in Jos, adding that the party received the news with grave sadness and rude shock. Dabang said that the deceased was one of the strongholds of the APC- led administration in the state, hence would be greatly missed. “The APC is saddened by the sudden demise of Mr Nanle. He died when he is most needed. “He was indeed very key and played strategic role to the successes achieved by the present regime in the state. “As a party, we commiserate with the relations, friends, wife, the entire family and the government and people of the state over this painful loss. “Our prayers and thoughts are with all at this dark moment, “he said. The News Agency of Nigeria  reports that Nanle was appointed Director of press in 2015, a position he held until his demise on Tuesday. The director died in an Indian hospital after a brief illness.
