Former Chelsea Captain John Terry has called off the proposed move to Russian club side Spartak Moscow. Terry had flown by private jet to Rome on Friday for a medical with the club ahead of finalising personal terms on a tax-free deal, believed to be in the region of £3million a year. With the move off, a statement from Terry read: ‘After considerable thought, I have decided to decline a contract offer from Spartak Moscow. I would like to take the opportunity to thank Spartak and wish them and their supporters well for the rest of the season. ‘They are an ambitious club and I have been very impressed with their professionalism. ‘But after assessing this move with my family, we’ve decided this is not the right move for ourselves at this time. Good luck Spartak.’ The 37-year-old has had numerous offers since leaving Aston Villa as a free-agent in the summer following their play-off final defeat to Fulham. Terry has kept himself fit by training throughout the summer and admitted to Sportsmail that he was ‘still hungry to play if everything around it is right’. ‘I am in the best condition I have been in for the last eight to 10 years of my career,’ said Terry. ‘I’ve had a brilliant summer, the first time in 20 years I have been able to get away like that with my family during the school holidays. ‘I was away so much last year because I was fully committed to giving everything to Aston Villa, but now I am fully recharged.’ The Russian side targeted Terry to replace French defender Samuel Gigot who picked up an anterior cruciate ligament injury last week and is out for the remainder of the season.
