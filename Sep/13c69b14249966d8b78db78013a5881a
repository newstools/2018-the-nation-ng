All quarrying/mining activities and borehole drilling have been suspended forthwith in parts of the Federal Capital Territory, FCT Minister Muhammad Bello, announced yesterday. It was in reaction to the earth tremors in the territory. Affected by the quarrying/mining and borehole drilling suspension are Mpape, Gwarimpa and Garki districts. The suspension will subsist pending the outcome of investigations on the causes of the tremors. Bello yesterday paid an on-the-spot visit to Mpape, the epicentre of reported incidents of earth tremors in parts of Abuja recently. Speaking for the minister, the FCT Permanent Secretary, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, assured residents that there was no cause for alarm. He said Abuja does not lie in any major seismic danger zone. The ministerâ€™s Chief Press Secretary, Cosmas Uzodinma, said preliminary reports on the tremors indicated that rock blasting from quarrying, mining activities and proliferation of borehole drilling might have caused the situation. Consequently, he stressed, it became necessary to suspend all quarrying activities in various sites of Abuja, especially Mpape, Garki, Gwarimpa and contiguous areas.
