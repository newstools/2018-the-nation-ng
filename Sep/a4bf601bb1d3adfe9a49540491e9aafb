The Rector of the Kogi State Polytechnic (KSP), Mr Isah Mohammed has finally resigned his appointment. This development was confirmed by the Public Relations Officer of the school, Luke Tijani in a press statement on Friday. “Mr Mohammed has officially handed over to his Deputy, Dr Attah Haruna. As I’m talking to you now, plans are already in place to appoint a substantive Rector by the visitor of the school. But for now, Dr Haruna will be on acting capacity before a substantive Rector is appointed.” The former Rector whose tenure expires on Friday, 7th September 2018, but seeking for a renewal of his tenure by the visitor of the Polytechnic did not also get the blessings of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (ASUP) and Non-Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (NASUP) which earlier in the past accused him of anti-labour activities in the institution. Under his watch, according to some students in the institution who begged for anonymity,students were forced to look for accommodation elsewhere in the town since the school could not provide any in the last two years. They alleged that the academic performance in the school had dropped drastically compared to several years ago. However, all efforts by this reporter to reach the former Rector proved abortive.
