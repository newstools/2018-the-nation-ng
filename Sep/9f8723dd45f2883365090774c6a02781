The United States has endorsed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)’s decision to declare the Osun State governorship elections inconclusive. The country however urged the winner to be declared after today’s supplementary election to be magnanimous in victory and the loser to be patient in defeat. American Ambassador to Nigeria Stuart Symington who said this in Kaduna yesterday, noted that the rerun is vital because every vote need to count given the fact that there was 353 vote margin between the two leading candidates, while over 3,000 votes could not be cast. Symington, who was represented by the Charge’d Affairs Mr David Young, urged the people to vote peacefully and accept the results of the elections peaceful as well. “We want to commend the people of Osun State for their peaceful vote last Saturday it was very positive for democracy, the people went to the polls in such large numbers about 700,000 voters, that is certainly an expression of democratic freedom that we applaud. We also applaud the peaceful contest that took place, the work of security operatives that guaranteed the peaceful votes. “I want to say that the electoral commission did a good job in terms of what we saw. The decision of INEC to go ahead and have a rerun in seven polling units is the one that we respect. Given the fact that there was almost 353 vote margin between the two candidates and a couple of a thousand votes were not able to be casted. Certainly this is a decision that makes sense. “We want to say that for the voters, through no fault of their own were not able to vote, it is important in a democracy that every persons vote is sacred and is allowed to count. Clearly as we go forward with the votes tommorow (today) in a democracy one side wins and one side loses. We want to emphasize that the people vote peacefully in the conduct of the election and accept the results peaceful as well.
