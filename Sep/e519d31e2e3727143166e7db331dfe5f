The indication emerged not only from the team’s line ups so far at the training camp in Victoria but following the Eagles Assistant Captain’s performance exhibited at the camp. The line up in Eagles training camp on Thursday saw the 25 year old manned the mid-field alongside another defensive mid-fielder Wilfred Ndidi and was full of energy and vibrant throughout the session. Gernot Rohr’s men lined up in a 4-2-3-1 formation for the Thursday’s training though this has not concretely  suggested Eagles final formation for the weekend clash as they are also open to other formation best suit the squad as deem fit by the German tactician. “Onazi showed tremendous power, pace and vision during the Eagles’ sessions that involved possession and ability to wriggle out of tight spaces as Rohr continue to build up the lads for the task of getting their AFCON qualifiers campaign back on track, after losing their first game 0-2 to South Africa in Uyo. “With the look of things Rohr may have to give the lad a chance to prove his mettle with a starting shirt on Saturday. I mean if he keeps this outstanding performance till the matchday he will return after losing his starting spot during the World Cup in Russia,” said an Official who watched the team’s training on Thursday.
