Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State has commended the Nigerian Military for its efforts at keeping Nigeria united as an indivisible entity. Akeredolu made the commendation while hosting the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 2 Division of the Nigerian Army in Ibadan, Maj.-Gen. Fidelis Azinta, on Friday in Akure. The governor noted that if military had not fought wars and other battles to keep the country as one, the unity being enjoyed today could not have been possible. “All of us in this country hold the existence of Nigeria to the military which has brought all of us together. “We look up to the Military as the last hope of this nation in terms of security. You have done your best and fought many wars to keep Nigeria united as one. “We appreciate all your efforts and may the labour of your heroes past never be in vain,” he said. According to him, no part of the country is being excluded in military administration. He advised Nigerians to see themselves as one like military personnel, adding that there was no way Nigeria could be divided for any reason. The governor described 32 Artillery Brigade, Owena, Akure, which falls under the division, as a tremendous assistance to the state government. Akeredolu, therefore, appealed to the GOC to consider possibility of building an estate on unused expanse of land in the brigade as it was done in the military division in Ibadan. He also enjoined Azinta to give the land to individuals who might be interested in temporary farming for use. Earlier, the GOC lauded the governor for honour accorded to the division by gracing the closing ceremony of the 2 Division Inter-Brigade Combat Proficiency Competitions 2018 of the Nigerian Army. He assured the governor that the brigade would do everything possible to ensure safety of lives and property in the state. “We want to assure you that with your support, together with other security agencies, we will flush out criminal elements out of the state,” he promised.
