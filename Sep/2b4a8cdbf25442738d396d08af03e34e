The Assistant Controller-General (ACG) of the Nigerian Prisons Service (NPS) Nanvyat Wuyep Gwali (rtd), who was gruesomely murdered by yet- to- be identified gunmen in his farmstead along Keffi – Nasarawa road in Nasarawa State, was finally laid to rest on Friday in his home town, Simchor in Kanamycin LGA of Plateau State. The body, which arrived at his village at about 11:45am, was greeted by a wailing crowd amidst curses perpetrators of the dastardly act would be unmasked and brought to book soonest. In a condolence message to the deceased’s family, the Controller-General of Prisons, Ja’afaru Ahmed, noted the late Gwali epitomised a gentleman officer, astute and courageous with a remarkable sense of commitment to the service of his father land throughout his career. Though sad that his life was cut short by evildoers and would be certainly missed by all, Ja’afaru urged the family members to take solace in the fact that the late officer led a life worthy of emulation. In a statement yesterday by the NPS Public Relations Officer, Francis Enobore, the prison boss prayed for the repose of the departed soul. He hoped those behind the wickedness be unveiled and brought to justice. Late Gwali was born on the 5th of April, 1956 and enlisted into the Nigerian Prisons Service in November, 1989 on transfer of service as a Superintendent of Prisons. He rose to the rank of Assistant Controller-General of Prisons before his retirement in April 2016. He went into farming and was murdered in his farm on August 10, 2018.
