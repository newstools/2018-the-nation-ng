The continued labour unrest in the country could deny workers their salaries, the Accountant-General of the Federation (AGF), Ahmed Idris, has warned. A statement by Ifeanyi Okereke, For: Head of Press and Public Relations (OAGF), Ahmed Idris, said  the payment of salaries cannot be achieved in an atmosphere where the critical stakeholders are not allowed access to their offices.” The AGF said: “Salary payment involves a number of processes that do not begin and end with the OAGF. There are other critical stakeholders  like the Cash Management Department in the Ministry of Finance and others that are supposed to do their beat before we can finalise. “We have a standing order from Mr. President to pay workers salaries from the 25th of every month, which we have striven hard to fulfill to Nigerian workers  and this month will not be an exception,” Idris stated. t  He said on coming to the office ysterday, “we met the gates of the office locked and wondered how we can keep this promise if we are being locked out of the office. “After speaking with the local arm of the Labour in the office on the need to pay salaries, they conceded to allow me and some of my staff in, but the Gates are still locked. I therefore appeal to labour to open our gates so that we can have unhindered access to meet their needs”. The AGF appealed to the National Leadership of Labour to reconsider their stand on the on-going strike  saying that the Federal Government under President Muhammadu Buhari more than ever has demonstrated high commitment towards meeting the welfare of the Nigerian Workers. Idris urged Labour to trust President Muhammadu Buhari “and return to the path of discussion, and negotiation, as the President has demonstrated enough commitment by setting up the tripartite committee.  The  committee which is headed by Ms. Amal Pepple is saddled with the responsibility of consulting widely with stakeholders with a view to coming up with a realistic and acceptable minimum wage.”
