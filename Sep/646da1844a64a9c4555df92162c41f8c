The modular refinery deal signed by the Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki and representatives of Peiyang Chemical Equipment Company (PCC) in China few days ago, has earned the state a chemical engineering programme. The programme to be domiciled in a university in the state, will be run in collaboration with the highly ranked Tianjin University, China, the oldest institution in the Asian country. According to Obaseki, “The university programme is an added benefit to the modular refinery deal which final investment agreement was signed few days ago in Beijing.” He explained that “The programme will build technical manpower for the oil and gas industry in line with the federal government’s policy on local capacity development in the sector. The idea is to develop technical manpower and set industry standards in the oil and gas sector.” He emphasized that Edo State has a large army of productive and creative young people that would leverage on the learning opportunity that the chemical engineering programme will provide. “Our young people will benefit from the world class programme of Tianjin University. Our goal is to equip more of our youths to participate in the new social and economic order we are creating in the state that will run on a solid industrial base. The social and economic opportunities we are providing across the state are increasing by the day and we want to prepare our young ones for the various industries.” Tianjin University is the oldest institution of higher education in the modern history of China and the leading research and teaching institute. The university was founded in 1895 as Peiyang University. Tianjin University’s 121-year history is the epitome of the progress of modern Chinese higher education, embodying the Chinese people’s indomitability through challenging times.
