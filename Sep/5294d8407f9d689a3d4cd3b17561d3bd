THE Federal Government has said it will explore avenues to ensure that the country benefited from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Minister of State for Environment, Mallam Ibrahim Jibril, stated this at a Gala Dinner and Certificates Award Night organised by the African Unionâ€™s (AU) Scientific, Technical and Research Commission in Abuja, to mark the end of a three-day Capacity Building Consultative Workshop for AU member states. The workshop was an avenue to train representatives of African states on how to access the GCF. According to the minister, accessing the fund would go a long way towards addressing climate change-related issues in the country. He said towards that end, the environment ministry was working with the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to generate renewable energy as a way of mitigating the effect of climate change. He added that it was to address climate-related issues that Nigeria became the first African country to raise the Sovereign Green Bond in line with the objectives of the Paris Agreement of 2015 to which it is a signatory. The minister stated that the government would encourage the 36 states to put proposals that would stand the test of time, to benefit from the GCF. He urged participants and other stakeholders to return to their various countries and apply the knowledge and lessons learned during the interactive sessions to help grow the various agencies, parastatals, organisations and academic institutions in their countries to grow. Highpoint of the evening was the award of certificates of participation to all the key stakeholders, participants and resource persons that were at the workshop. No fewer than 20 African countries were represented at the workshop.
