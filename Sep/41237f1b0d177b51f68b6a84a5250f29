The police yesterday prevented the mobbing of a man, Idris Garba, apprehended by vigilantes for allegedly attempting to snatch a motorcycle at Ejigbo, Lagos. Garba, said to have been armed with a locally-made pistol, allegedly attempted to snatch the motorcycle he boarded near Powerline bus stop. The Nation learnt that the rider raised the alarm and members of a vigilance group, who were nearby, accosted Garba. The vigilantes were said to have descended on the suspect, but his friends rallied round him. It was gathered that the incident degenerated to a fight, with the parties throwing stones and bottles against each other. It took the intervention of policemen from Ejigbo Division to rescue Garba and douse tension. A source said those sympathetic to him stoned the policemen, damaging their vehicles. He said some people, including policemen, were injured in the melee. It was gathered that Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) and patrol teams raced to the scene. Command spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), denied that there were casualties. He said: “The incident occurred around 5am. A suspect was apprehended by vigilantes when he attempted to snatch a motorcycle from the owner. His friends mobilised and came for the vigilantes in a bid to free him. “The situation would have been ugly, but for the intervention of the police. Our men were stoned, but they restrained themselves from using firearms, since it was dark. “They managed to get the suspect out of the place to prevent him from being lynched by a mob or rescued by his friends. A locally-made pistol was recovered from him. He is in safe custody and peace has been restored.”
