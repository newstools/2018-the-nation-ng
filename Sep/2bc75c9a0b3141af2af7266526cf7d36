An Edo Central Senatorial aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress ( APC ), Mr Theophillus Okoh, has denied reports that he has been forced to step down. Okoh told newsmen that he didn’t agree to step down from the race after a meeting with Governor Godwin Obaseki. He said no aspirants in Edo Central can boast of his political structure in Esan land. Okoh said Governor Obaseki however expressed reservation over the support for his aspiration. According to him, “It is very wicked rumor and a way to sabotage my campaign. I never did or promised the governor that I am collapsing my structure. “I met with Obaseki quite alright. We had an argument and I told him that I was running but he had his reservation about my aspiration. “I met with leaders of the party in the state including Comrade Adams Oshiomhole who told me that the leadership of the party will not impose or nominate candidate for us in Edo Central. “I want to put it on record that that I have not collapsed my structure. My structure is intact and working. I have structure more than any other person in Esanland ” “I am not going to step down for any body for any reason. I am going to run. The governor assured that they will provide a level playing ground for all aspirants”.
