With the successful hosting of the sixth edition of the Africa Magic Viewer’s Choice Awards (AMVCA) recently at Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos, the awards has quickly become one of the most anticipated events on the African calendar. From the hitch-free flow of the event to the superbly lit stage and inspiring acceptance speeches, the AMVCAs gave viewers all over the continent so much to love including the pairing of media personalities – IK Osakioduwa and Minnie Dlamini Jones – as hosts. While IK has compered all six AMVCAs, the winning formula featuring Minnie, made its debut at the 2016 edition of the award show. The duo have thrilled guests and viewers with their brilliant synergy, charm and infectious wit since they were paired. This year’s edition was no different as the two hosts brought their usual chemistry back to the AMVCA stage and reminded us why we love them together. The magical combination of IK and Minnie works for multiple reasons; the mutual respect they have for each other, they are a sight for sore eyes, the way they bounce off of each other and of course, their reverence for other African cultures. Whether it’s IK subtly chiding celebrities about their cultural backgrounds or Minnie donning a Nigerian head gear for a significant portion of the award show, it is obvious that these two presenters are very aware of the platform which they have been given.
