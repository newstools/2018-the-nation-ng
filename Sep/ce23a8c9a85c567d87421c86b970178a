Former Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos Sole Administrator Taoheed Adebayo Taiwo has joined the league of people aspiring for the House of Representatives in Oshodi-Isolo. At his declaration in Ilasamaja, Taiwo said he wants to ensure better representation of his constituency at the National Assembly. This, he said, would aid his humanitarian gesture. “I have always been in politics. I was born and brought up in a political family as you can see my father is one of the leaders of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Lagos state. Politics is about service to humanity, delivering the essential necessities of lives to the people. I derived a lot of joy in putting smiles on the faces of the people,” he said. He boasted that he is an aspirant to beat during the primary election due to his track record. “I will definitely become victorious as you can see the crowd around. I have served as a supervisor before in Ejigbo Local Council Development Area and also the Sole Administrator in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government. My good work speaks for me.  If you go to Oshodi today, you will see the good thing I have done there – the legislative building I inaugurated and a lot of infrastructural development I was able to bring to Oshodi. These gave us victory during the local government election held last year,” he said. According to him, Ilasamaja has never had anyone in the House of Representatives despite its population size, adding “Ilasamaja is one of the biggest in terms of population and revenue generation; we have all it takes but it is unfortunate that we don’t have much representation when it comes to people in governance. My people are yearning for a better representative. It is the turn of Ilasamaja to produce a House of Representatives member because never in the history of Ilasamaja have we had anybody to represent us at that level.”
