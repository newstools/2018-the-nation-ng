The Lagos State Government has urged applicants for the on-going 2,200 teachersâ€™ recruitment exercise in the state to be patient with the system. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mrs Adebunmi Adekanye made the call following complaints by some applicants that the job portal (http://jobs.lagosstate.gov.ng) is slow. In a statement signed by the Director, Public Affairs, Lagos State Ministry of Education, Mrs Adekanye said the portal was expected to be busy, given the number of applicants seeking to register at the same time. She however assured that the back-end team was working assiduously to regularly decongest it to allow for the flow of applications which has been dropping in droves. The Permanent Secretary urged the applicants not to panic as they have till Thursday to send in their applications. She said the more applicants succeed in submitting their applications, the lesser the traffic on the portal. Adekanye reiterated the commitment of the Government to fairness and transparency in the recruitment exercise aimed at injecting fresh and qualified Teachers into the Public Primary and Secondary Schools in the State to further advance teaching and learning in the State public schools. The Nation had learnt from an applicant on Sunday that the portal was not accessible. When this reporter tried visiting the site, it was not accessible on Sunday. But by Monday evening, the portal was accessible.
