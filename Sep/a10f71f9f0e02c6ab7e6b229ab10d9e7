.RESIDENTS RENDERED HOMELESS  A portion of Ado-Iworoko Road in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital has been taken over by a massive flood making passage difficult for residents. The flood was consequent upon heavy rains witnessed in the city in the last one week which also rendered many residents homeless. Property worth millions of Naira including houses, cars and household items have been destroyed by the deluge. The Ado-Iworoko Road, a federal highway which leads to Ekiti State University (EKSU), communities in Ekiti North senatorial district and northern states, has been rendered impassable by a big pool of flood very close to Ayemi Garage and Pathfinder. Motorists, motorcyclists and pedestrians have been shut out of one lane of the road while the other lane is also under threat as the Elemi River has overflown its bank spilling the massive flood on the road. The flooded road caused a huge traffic snarl on the road as many motorists were afraid of entering the flood to proceed on their trips. Hundreds of residents of breast Olorunda and Olorunsogo areas have been sacked from their homes by the raging flood. A visit to the affected areas by The Nation on Tuesday showed the beleaguered residents wearing mournful looks on the calamity that befell them.  One of the victims, Oluwafemi Joseph, called for the assistance of the state government in constructing drainage and channels to tackle flooding. Commuters along Ado-Iworoko Road, Agbaje Adedoyin and Adesoye Subulade, also demanded construction of modern bridge to ease free flow of water. It will be recalled that a commercial motorcyclist was swept off by flood at the same spot last year and his remains were not found until after two days.
