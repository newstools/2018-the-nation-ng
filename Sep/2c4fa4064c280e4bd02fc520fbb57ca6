Despite the Super Eagles’ emphatic 3-0 bashing of hosts Seychelles in Saturday’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier, the team handler, Gernot Rohr has revealed  that the Eagles had to contend with other problems before achieving victory. Eagles’ Captain of the day Ahmed Musa’s deflected shot, Chidozie Awaziem’s goal and Odion Igalo’s efforts gave the Eagles the 3-0 victory but the Eagles’ gaffer said his team had to contend with the strong wind and most importantly synthetic grass before achieving Nigeria’s first three points in the ongoing AFCON qualifier. “We dominated from the beginning and scored logically two nice goals. The synthetic grass and the strong wind were not easy to handle for our players. Ighalo scored again and we didn’t concede a goal”, Rohr disclosed to Sporting Life shortly after the match yesterday.
