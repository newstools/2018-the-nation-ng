After a successful cinema run with her last movie ‘Christmas is Coming’, Ufuoma McDermott is set to take her latest movie, ‘What Just Happened’ to the cinemas nationwide, starting this Friday, September 14. The movie tells the story of a disgruntled professor who goes in search of a man. She takes up her brother’s offer for the position of a visiting lecturer at the University of Ibadan. So, what should have been a one-hour journey from Lagos to Ibadan ends up being a disaster. Partly, (this was) as a result of her high-handedness and selfishness. The entire movie is a testimony, recounted in church. The comedy sees Ufuoma playing the lead role and also stars Afeez Oyetoro, Segun Arinze, Toyin Abraham, Mc Abbey, Funny bone and Mike Ezuruonye. Ufuoma, whose journey into Nollywood began in Zeb Ejiro’s 2004 movie, ‘The President Must Not Die’ has since become a producer and director. While announcing that the movie will be in cinemas from Friday, Ufuoma thanked the media and her fans. “I feel blessed for all the love I get from people and even the media each time I announce a new project,” she said. “What Just Happened is my new baby and I trust that the support will not be any different this time. Thank you guys for always supporting.”
