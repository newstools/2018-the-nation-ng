Former Speaker, Osun State House of Assembly, Hon. Adejare Bello, has hailed the conduct of the election in his polling unit, adding that he would give the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) a passmark, if the same scenario is replicated at the various polling units across the state. His words: “As far as this polling unit is concerned, I would say so far, so good. We have been restricted from moving around during the election, so I have no way of knowing what is happening elsewhere. “But, if what us happening here is replicated in all the polling units,  I will give INEC a passmark and I will say that the exercise has been successful. “At this polling unit, the disabled were given the opportunity to cast their votes; some of them were assisted by their able-bodied counterparts. “As you can see, voting is still underway at this unit as at 1.30pm. This is because we have close to a thousand registered voters are registered here and the turnout is quite high.”
