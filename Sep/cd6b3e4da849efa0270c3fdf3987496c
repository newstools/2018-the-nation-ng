Governor Samuel Ortom has approved the sack of Mr Andrew Torhide Uchi as Executive Secretary of the Benue State Examinations Board. In his place, Mr Isaac Iorbee Hom has been appointed. A statement issued by the Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Professor Dennis Ityavyar, said Mr Uchiâ€™s removal is due to the fact that his continued stay in office is not in the best interest of the board. The statement added that the appointment of the new Executive Secretary is with immediate effect and directed the former Secretary to complete handover to Uchi within three days.
