Chairman of Esan West Local Government Patrick Aguinede has faulted the Police report that the killing of some students at a graduation party on Tuesday was cult related. Aguinede said investigation showed there was disagreement among some ‘G-boys’, also known as Yahoo Yahoo over money sharing. Some final-year students of Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, and a female member of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) were killed by gunmen at the party. The slain corps member was said to have visited her boyfriend, who was said to be the target of the gunmen. Police spokesman DSP Chidi Nwabuzor said the killing was done by a rival cult gang. But Aguinede said the killers missed their target and killed five persons in anger. He urged security agencies to tighten surveillance in the community. “The true position is that it was not cult-related as being speculated. It has to do with disagreement over money. “We gathered that those G-boys from places, such as Kenya, were quarrelling over money. “It is unfortunate that the boy they came for escaped and they now killed five persons. Four boys and a girl.”
