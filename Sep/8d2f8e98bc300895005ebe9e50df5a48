The Elders’ Forum of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State has called on former Governor Segun Oni to withdraw the suit challenging the eligibility of the Governor-elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, to stand as candidate in the last governorship election. The body made the appeal at a meeting held on Wednesday in Igbara Odo, Ekiti Southwest Local Government Area, presided over by its Chairman, Chief George Akosile. The issue formed the major topic of discussion at the APC Elders’ Forum meeting with members resolving that withdrawal of the case by Oni would be in interest of the party and Ekiti State. According to a communiqué issued at the end of the meeting, a copy of which was made available to reporters in Ado-Ekiti on Friday, the APC chieftains said the withdrawal of the case by Oni and his group will facilitate an out-of-court settlement.

The Ekiti APC Elders’ Forum also resolved to send a memo to Fayemi to reconcile wish the aggrieved (Oni) group with a view to withdrawing the case from court and their inclusion in the forthcoming administration.
