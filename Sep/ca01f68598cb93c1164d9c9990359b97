An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Thursday sentenced the driver of a commercial bus, Obinna Obasi, to one month imprisonment for stealing a retired police officer’s wallet containing N33, 000 and 20 dollars. Magistrate Ope Agbe convicted Obasi, 36, following his plea of guilty to a one-count charge of stealing, contrary to Section 287(7) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. He said the devil pushed him to steal the wallet. Earlier, prosecuting Sergeant Cyriacus Osuji, who reviewed the facts of the case, said Obasi committed the offence on 28 August, 2018 at Chevron roundabout, Ajah, Lagos. He said Obasi drove his Volkswagen T4 bus with Reg. No LSD 61 XT dangerously and hit the complainant’s Lexus SUV, causing it damage. The convict agreed to follow the complainant to his panel beater and repair the SUV, following which the complainant told him to get in the back seat of vehicle. They drove to the panel beater’s workshop, but as soon as they got there, Obasi told the complainant that he was going to the bank to withdraw money to pay the panel beater. He left and did not return. When the complainant checked his vehicle, he discovered that his wallet containing N33, 000, $20, his driving license, Voters Card, Retired SPO Identity Card, and three Automated Teller Machine cards were missing. Obasi was subsequently arrested by the Ajah Police Division, Lagos.
