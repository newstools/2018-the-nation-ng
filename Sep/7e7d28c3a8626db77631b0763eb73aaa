Former Acting Governor, Adamawa State, Hon. Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri, has officially declared his intention to contest for governor on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party. He made the declaration at the party secretariat in Yola, where he defied a torrential downpour to address the mammoth crowd. The former Speaker, Adamawa House of Assembly said the condition of the state, which he claims has been constantly and embarrassingly lagging behind its peers, and the pressure from the people of Adamawa State prompted him to indicate interest in the governorship race. In his words, “That Adamawa State has not been working and that it has been constantly lagging behind its peers is no news. That we continue on this trajectory as long as we do not change the direction and quality of governance is open to debate. That the consequences not only for the poor but also the rich are threateningly ominous is also not in doubt. “Indeed to continue doing the same thing and expect different result is another definition of insanity.” He therefore said, “I have no option than to succumb to the sustained pressure by the people of Adamawa to join this race.” While commissioning his campaign office, Fintiri said he will present himself before the party on the 28th, and officially declare on the 29th. The governorship aspirant also said he is open to a consensus, but if that does not work, then all will have to go the poll. Chairman, PDP, Adamawa State chapter, Barr. Tahir Shehu promised a free and fair primary and a level playing ground to all candidates.
