The Executive Governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode on Monday picked his nomination form for second term race to govern the state. He picked the form at the All Progressives Congress (APC) Headquarters in Abuja. Ambode arrived  around 12.30p.m with his entourage. Speaking on Ambode’s second term bid, former Chairman of Shomolu Local Government Area, Gbolahan Bagostowe, said “I think Ambode will win the primary and the election proper. I stand to be corrected, I don’t think any aspirant in APC can beat Ambode as of now. “Ambode has worked very well. It’s what everyone can see. Infrastructural development in health, schools and many others. “What he has done is visible for all Lagosians to see. Ambode is working, Lagos State is moving.” he added Asked if the division among the APC aspirants in the state will not affect the fortunes of the party in the election, Bagostowe, who now wants to be a lawmaker in Lagos State House of Assembly, said “At the end of the day they will always settle their differences. “Everybody will become one at the end of the primary election.” he said On the opposition’s strength against Ambode in the forthcoming election, he said “You cannot compare the opposition in Lagos State now with 2015. Ambode has silenced them. “Some of them are now decamping to APC. Look at the former Chairman, Honorable Salvador, he has moved half part of PDP to APC in Lagos State.” he stated
