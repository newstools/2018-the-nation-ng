A chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Sen. Ahmed Makarfi, has denied having an anointed aspirant for the Kaduna State governorship race. Makarfi’s denial followed cracks in the party as five governorship aspirants accused the state party chairman of favouring a particular candidate out of the 11 currently seeking for the PDP ticket. Makarfi, a presidential aspirant under the PDP, is also accused of having anointed one of the aspirants to emerge as the party’s candidate. However, a statement issued in Kaduna on Saturday by his media aide Mukhtar Sirajo, dismissed the insinuation as mere rumour. “Our attention has been drawn to rumour going round to the effect that Sen. Makarfi has anointed some aspirants for some offices, including the governorship ticket of the PDP in Kaduna State. “We wish to make it very clear that the distinguished has not anointed anybody. “Senator Makarfi’s only preference is for the party to win all available positions in the forthcoming elections.  “This is the more reason why he still encourages the coming together of all the aspirants with a view to forging a common understanding that will pave way for a smooth and successful campaign for whoever eventually emerges as the party’s candidate. ” It will be a big boost if they are able to come to an agreement among themselves so that they can save energy and resources to channel towards the general elections. “Where however, they fail to come to an agreement, the Senator believes that the democratic rights of all of them must be respected by the party providing a level playing field for all to participate in a free and fair primaries at which party members will freely take a decision. “Senator Makarfi wishes all aspirants the best and urges delegates to freely exercise their rights,” the statement said.
