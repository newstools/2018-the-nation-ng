Immediate past National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie Oyegun, has said that the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) was in order to declare Osun State governorship elections inconclusive. Chief Oyegun said INEC acted in line with the Electoral Act. Oyegun who with newsmen in Benin City said the APC led federal government should be commended for allowing democracy to prevail. He said Osun people freely expressed their will and ensured that the votes count. The former Edo governor also appealed to Osun voters to reward the good works of the APC on Thursday for ensuring free, fair and credible election in their state. Chief Oyegun explained that he stacked with President Muhammadu Buhari because he represents the light house the nation needs at the moment for economic growth. “In a country that lacked heroes, Buhari stands out. We must represent the very positive traits of integrity honesty in him; I believe that is what the nation needs now. “Buhari is that light house that we need in a society that is enveloped in darkness of corruption, lack of standard, ethics and morality. “He may not be perfect like any other human being but he is what the nation needs at the moment to ensure steady growth.”
