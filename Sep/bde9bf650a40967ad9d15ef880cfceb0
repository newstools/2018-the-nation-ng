The Osun State governorship election is generating controversy. It is not because it was not free and fair. Some interested parties are raising eyebrow over the inconclusive poll, although the umpire may have averted a major disaster by declaring it inconclusive. The two main parties-the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP)-ran neck to neck in the election. The inconclusive results reflected the spread of the parties. APC led in 15 of 30 local governments. It also came second in local councils where it was defeated by the PDP. The PDP won clearly in 12 councils. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC scored 254, 345. PDP had 254, 698. The margin is 353, which is a far cry from the 3, 498 total cancelled votes. The election was cancelled in two units at Orolu, and one each at Ife South, Ife North and Osogbo. The cancelation has basis in law. Where the difference in lawful votes scored by the two leading candidates in an election is less than the number of registered voters in cancelled polling units, the election shall be declared inconclusive. Explaining reasons for the cancellation, the electoral agency said there were attempted ballot snatching and other unruly behaviours at the units, which violated the electoral law. But, a total cancellation without a redress would have been tantamount to disentrancement of the electorate. Therefore, in line with the provisions of the guidelines, INEC announced a rerun for the polling units. The exercise will hold on Thursday. The six outstanding units are statistically important. Now, they are also strategic to both parties. The two units in Orolu has 947 voters. The Osogbo unit has 884 voters. The Ife units have 1, 314 voters. The bone of contention is the cancelled 3, 498 votes. So “huge” and “significant” is the figure that the Chief Returning Officer, Prof. Joseph Fuwape, said it could swing victory either in favour of APC’s Gboyega Oyetola and Ademola Adeleke of the PDP. The only way out of the logjam is rerun.Also, the statutory solution is not new. Its practical application, according to observers, has its antecedents in the inconclusive The Kogi State governorship poll. The Returning Officer, Emmanuel Kucha, said the late Prince Audu Abubakar of the APC scored 240, 867 votes while former Governor Idris Wada of the PDP had 199, 514 votes. The margin of votes, Kucha said, was 41, 353. He therefore, declared the exercise inconclusive, claiming that the total number of registered voters in 91 polling units across 18 councils where the poll was cancelled was 49, 953. Although the APC was the ruling party, it could not influence INEC. The agency organised a rerun. In Imo State, the 2015 governorship election was inconclusive. Governor Rochas Okorocha of the APC polled 385, 671 votes. Hon. Ihedioha of the PDP got 306, 142 votes. The margin was 79, 529; 144, 715 votes were cancelled. The commission under Prof. Attahiru Jega ordered a rerun. In 2011, a senatorial election in Anambra State was declared inconclusive. The contestants were Dr. Chris Ngige of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) and the late Prof. Dora Akunyili of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Ngige reportedly got 65, 576; Akunyili got 66, 273 votes. The margin was 697. Since the poll did not take place in some wards with a voting population higher than the margin, a supplementary exercise was ordered by INEC. Also, in Bayelsa, the governorship poll was at half in 2015. Governor Seriake Dickson (PDP) got 105, 748 votes. Timpreye Sylva (APC) polled 72,594. The margin was 33,154. In Southern Ijaw, it was reported that APC won all the 120,000 votes in Southern Ijaw. The INEC boss was infuriated. A rerun was ordered.
