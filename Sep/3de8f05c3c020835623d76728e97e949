All is set for the 8th annual Lights Camera Africa Film Festival holding from Friday 28th to Sunday 30th September, 2018 at the Agip Hall, MUSON Center, Lagos. The three-day event which has as its theme, ‘Who Do You Think You Are?’ is a free-to-attend festival. According to the Festival Director, Ugoma Adegoke, the event which features curated African and independent cinema will focus on the politics of ethnicity and identity as well as protest and resistance. “The festival will focus on growing trends which threaten the ideal of the modern state today,” she said in a statement. “Fragmenting communities and putting up walls – it is our view that this is a result of a poor understanding of what has gone before and our connections to that. “The modern African continent was built on a cause that transcended individual identities. The new continent developed a common identity and values against the enemy of colonialism and later, apartheid. These were encapsulated in the spirit of Pan-Africanism which gave vent to ideals crafted in protest and resistance – alliance and alignment with other African peoples and causes reflecting a common history and destiny on the continent and throughout the Black Diaspora. The heroes to whom we owe today and the struggles they fought are forgotten. In the years that have followed, it appears as though those histories and identities collapsed. “With this year’s eighth edition, the festival focuses on a core aspect of its message – to connect with issues that are rooted in the African experience.”
