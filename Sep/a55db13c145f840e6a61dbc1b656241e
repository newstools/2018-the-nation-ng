Tragedy struck in Ikeja on Saturday, as a journalist, Dickson Akinwunmi, 50, and his 10-year-old son, Nelson, were suffocated in a fire at a shopping complex. It was gathered that the fire broke out around 5am at 42, Awolowo Way, where the late Akinwunmi had his office. He and his son slept in the office because he was producing his magazine. The inferno started from another shop. Akinwunmi, a former reporter with The Punch, moved to Marketing Edge, before he established Brand Campaign Magazine. Police spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), said the cause of the fire was being investigated. The control room, he said, got a distress call around 5:20am about the fire. He said the complex housed shopping and residential apartments. Oti said: “One of the shops where the fire started was completely razed. Mr. Akinwunmi and his son were choked to death. Various patrol vehicles were deployed to provide security. “Two fire trucks were on ground and extinguished the fire. The team took photographs of the scene and the bodies were moved to Mainland Hospital Mortuary, Yaba. “We do not know the value of properties destroyed yet.” Akinwunmi’s former boss, John Ajayi described the death as a great shock. He said: “His death still remains a great shock and deep pain to all of us. It is still incredible as he was hale and hearty until the ugly fire event. “As a family member of Marketing Edge, I want to appeal to all of us to pray fervently for the repose of his soul and that of his son so that they can find perfect rest in the Lord’s bossom. “We also pray the good Lord to grant all family members he left behind the fortitude to bear this great loss.”
