The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (ASUP) at Rufus Giwa Polytechnic, Owo, Ondo State, at the weekend called for immediate release of the White Paper on various panels’ reports on the state-owned institution. The union decried the prolonged delay in the release of the documents, calling for their immediate implementation. In a 16-point communique issued after its emergency meeting in Owo and signed by its Chairman, R. O. Ijawoye, and General Secretary, Arikawe Ade, ASUP also condemned the non-payment of 10-month salary arrears owed the polytechnic workers. ASUP described the development as insensitivity, adding that the situation had led to the deaths of many workers in the polytechnic due to their inability to foot their medical bills as a result of financial incapacitation. The communique reads: “We are also much disturbed by non-payment of 16-month migration arrears owed staff of the institution which depicts extreme callousness, we are now calling for its immediate payment.” The union kicked against what it called inadequate release of only N100 million by the state government for accreditation of over 40 academic programmes, adding: “We will not condone the use of fund for no other thing except accreditation/reaccreditation of courses.” It said academic workers would be held responsible for failure of the exercise. ASUP also regretted the poor state of infrastructure on the campus and called for appropriate processing and utilisation of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETfund) meant for staff development. On the recent student unrest in the institution, ASUP charged the management to compensate those whose properties were destroyed having collected reparation fees from all students. The union also called for immediate payment of all outstanding deductions meant for the Cooperative Societies in the School, which it noted was currently about N500 million.
