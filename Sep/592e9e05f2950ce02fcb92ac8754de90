Juventus’ star Douglas Costa is expected to be hit with a hefty ban after head-butting an opponent and then spitting in his mouth during yesterday’s 2-1 win over Sassuolo. The game should have been memorable for Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored his first two Juventus goals, but Costa’s late antics took the spotlight away from his team-mate. Costa’s minute of madness came in stoppage time and began with him taking out Federico Di Francesco with a bad tackle. He then elbowed his opponent as they both rose to their feet. The referee allowed play to continue as Sassuolo was still in possession and attacking. And indeed they went on to score, with Khouma Babacar heading in a consolation goal. As Sassuolo tried to rush the ball back to the halfway line so that they could resume the game, Costa and Di Francesco clashed again. This time Costa head-butted Di Francesco, before spitting at him from very close range. Referee Daniele Chiffi sent Costa off after consulting the VAR. The 28-year-old former Bayern Munich star could face more than three games on the sidelines if found guilty of both violent conduct and spitting, the latter of which would be categorised as ‘gross un-sportsmanship conduct’. After the game Costa took to Instagram to say sorry for his actions, telling supporters: ‘I want to apologise to all the Juventus’ fans for this over the top reaction I had during today’s game. ‘I also apologise to my teammates, who are always by my side, in good and bad times. It was ugly, I am aware of that and I apologise to everyone for that. ‘I want to make clear that this isolated conduct has nothing to do with what I’ve shown throughout my career.’ Costa’s actions were met with widespread horror on Twitter as fans and pundits alike condemned him.
