A group, the Movement for Disabled Rights, has advocated a special budget for the physically-challenged. The National Coordinator, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, said yesterday in Lagos during a peace rally to commemorate the World Peace Day that it was time the country prioritised the welfare of the physically-challenged. He said: “President Muhammadu Buhari should prioritise the welfare of the physically-challenged. A special budget should be made for them and it should be made mandatory for all tiers of government. This will make life easy for them. “We are all equal and born equally. If able-bodied people can commit suicide on a daily basis because of the difficulty in eking out a living, you can imagine the difficulty the physically-challenged go through to survive in these hard times.” Oshilaja hailed the leadership of All Progressives Congress (APC) for adopting direct primaries. He said the wisdom of the APC leadership to adopt direct primaries for the coming general election was commendable. Oshilaja said the method would enhance the worth of candidates and make them accountable to Nigerians, adding that it would enable the electorate to have a say in who would govern them. “The wisdom in the adoption of direct primary by President Buhari and the leadership of APC is commendable, especially considering its significance in deepening democratic practice. It will have effect on providing good governance and delivering the dividends of democracy,” he said.
