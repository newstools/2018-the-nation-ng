Tragedy struck at No. 44 Freetown, Sabon Gari, Kano, on Monday night, when a 10-year old boy, Ifeanyi Ogbodo got electrocuted while running errands for the mother. It was gathered that the tragic incident happened as a result of alleged carelessness of officials of Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) who after disconnecting electricity from the said building, left the naked wires hanging on the roof top of the building. According to the Mother of the victim simply identified as Mama Ifeanyi, “I sent my son on an errand in that building, while frying yam for sale on the road side close to the house. My son was electrocuted while holding on to the iron door at the entrance of the building.” The bereaved mother blamed her son’s death to the naked wire allegedly left behind by KEDCO officials, while crying for justice, insisting that, “I cannot believe my son is dead. They should do something fast. Ifeanyi’s untimely death must not be swept under the carpet.” She said the little boy died shortly after he was rushed to a nearby hospital. According to eyewitness account, “the disconnected naked wires were touching the iron sheet of the building and when the distribution company restored power supply, the house was endangered with electric shock, hence forcing the occupants to flee.” When contacted on telephone, KEDCO’s Spokesman, Muhammed Kandi said the company’s technical officials have been mobilised to the area to calm the situation and confirm the root cause of the incident. “We are still investigating the real cause of that incident. Already, our Technical Officers have been deployed to the area. Before the end of today, I will get back to you,” he added.
