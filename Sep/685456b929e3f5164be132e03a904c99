 He said he would never promise what he would not be able to deliver, saying development eould be spread  across the state. “I am prepared for this job. I will hit the ground running. I know where to start and no one is going to tell what is next to do. I will protect the welfare of the people of the state, including our hard- working, who had made enough sacrifice for this great state and make it to be what it is today,” he said.
