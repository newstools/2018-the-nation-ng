Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task Force) Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police  (CSP), has released vehicles kept at the agency’s traffic yard in Ikorodu. No fewer than seven motorists collected their vehicles on Tuesday, according to a statement issued by the agency yesterday. Other motorists have been asked to report at the unit’s office for proper identification and other processes. The chairman gave the order when he visited the traffic yard on Tuesday. The visit was prompted by complaints that some operatives were extorting money from the motorists. Although they allegedly committed offences ranging from driving against traffic, driving on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lane to causing obstructions, among others, the motorists pleaded for mercy. Egbeyemi said his action was to prove that the government is not interested in creating hardship for people. He warned that any task force member caught extorting money from people would face the law. “It is not that we are anti-masses. We fight those people that are adamant and defiant. We are not in a state of anarchy; we are in an orderly society where there must be law and order. We take offenders to court, and once anyone is pronounced guilty, such ends in prison. “How can a sane driver drive against another vehicle coming on speed: this is how innocent people are killed. “I am appealing to Lagosians to abide by the law and regulations that guide road use. Be a good citizen and don’t offer members of the taskforce bribe and in case any of them demand please kindly report,” he said.
