The Lagos State Government has served final contravention notices on some car wash operators on WEMPCO and Akilo roads in Ogba for violating the planning and standard operational guidelines. Lagos State Planning and Environmental Monitoring Authority (LASPEMA) Acting General Manager Olanrenwaju Kazeem said the notice were a warning to others whose activities were threatening the environmen. “The state government will continue to sanction car wash operators whose facilities violate the Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2010 through notices on contravention, stop work order and seal,” he said. Failure to adhere to guidelines and laws, he said, would lead to the sealing off of the operators’ businesses within seven days. Kazeem lamented the rate at which car wash businesses were springing up in the state.  According to him, if the practice is not standardised, it would affect the government’s urban regeneration plans.
