After casting his vote, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, has assured his supporters that, if he is not rigged out by the authorities in charge of the process, he is sure of victory. Adeleke who arrived exactly 8am at his polling unit 009, Ward 2, Abogunde/Sagba registration area, Ede North, was the first to vote at the unit. The Card Reader Machine had initially difficulties authenticating his fingerprints, but after about five minutes, he succeeded in doing his accreditation. The PDP flag bearer who voted at about 8.07am told reporters afterwards that so far everything was proceeding normally and that if it continues that way he is sure of victory. He said attempts were made to frustrate his bid, to destabilise him ahead of the election, but everything failed in the end. Buoyed by the support he is getting from his constituency in Ede, Senator Adeleke who surprisingly emerged winner of the Osun West senatorial by-election in July 2017 fancies himself as the next governor of Osun State. Adeleke became actively involved in partisan politics when he contested and won the by-election on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),Â  after the death of his elder brother, former Governor Isiaka Adeleke, then a serving senator, in April 2017. Ademola Adeleke had defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP, when he suspected that the ruling APC in Osun State would deny him its ticket for the contest. He proved book makers wrong when he won the election which was conducted on July 23, 2017. Everyone had expected the APC to win the election.
