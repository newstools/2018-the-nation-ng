The sleepy town of Epe, Lagos was in festive mood as the 2018 edition of the popular Kayokayo Festival came to an end on Saturday. According to Alhaji Saliu Okulu, Baameto of Epe and coordinator of the event’s committee this year, the festival is a celebration of the religious, cultural and social aspects of Epe Kingdom. Speaking on the festival, Oba (Dr) Shefiu Olatunji Adewale, Olu Epe of Epe Kingdom, said Epe is made up of two communities; the Ijebu and Eko communities who have always been at peace with each other. He disclosed that part of the Kayokayo Festival is based on the celebration of the coming of King Kosoko to Epe in 1851. According to the monarch, Epe, which incidentally is the hometown of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, aims to use the socio-cultural event to position the town as a tourism hub. While stating that the religious aspect tends towards heralding the New Islamic Year with 1st Hijra calendar Muharram, he said the cultural dimension commemorates King Kosoko’s landing in Epe just as the social aspect is about celebrating communal bonding by making and sharing abundant food to all. Among dignitaries at the festival were Governor Ambode, Otunba Gani Adams, the Aare Oona Kakanfo of Yoruba; Dr. Abiola Dosunmu, Erelu of Lagos, traditional rulers in the state as well as music stars including Malaika, Queen Salawa Abeni and Sugar Boy.
