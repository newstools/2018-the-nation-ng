The National Association of Proprietors of Private Schools (NAAPS), Lagos State chapter, is set to launch an online television, as part of activities to mark the 2018 NAAPS Day scheduled for October 12. Its President, Mr. Wasiu Adumadeyin, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Lagos that the television would enable members view its past and present programmes online. He said the online TV would also feature a special weekly programme to showcase inventions from schools, graduation ceremonies and other innovations developed by members’ schools to promote creativity. “We have about 50 programmes, which include retreat, seminars, children day celebration and others already uploaded on the site for any interested persons to access and have insight to what we do. “NAAPS Day is a day set aside to celebrate school proprietors, teachers and education institutions because they deserve being celebrated. “Since nobody is celebrating teachers and they have been so neglected, we the proprietors of private schools are taking it up to celebrate them,” Adumadeyin said. According to him, the 2018 NAAPS Day will be exceptional, as it will last three days instead of the usual one day. He said activities for the event would hold on October 12 and 13, with over 20,000-member and non-member proprietors and teachers in Lagos State attending. The activities include merit award, consolation prizes for best teachers in schools and raffle draw. The theme of the celebration is: “Re -Engineering Nigeria’s Education System for Effective Nation Building.” Lagos State governor’s wife, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode, is the mother of the day, while the Chairman, Premier Lotto (Baba Ijebu), Sir Adebutu Kesigton, will chair the occasion.
