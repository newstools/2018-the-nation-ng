Readers of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) stormed Osogbo, Osun state capital, yesterday to canvas votes for the party’s candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke. Stalwarts of the party, including National Chairman Uche Secondus; Senate President and Chairman of National Campaign Council for Osun Election Senator Bukola Saraki; former Vice President and Presidential  aspirant, Atiku Abubakar; PDP Vice Chairman (Southwest), Eddy Olafeso; and the Osun State Chairman, Soji Adagunodo, advised voters to protect their votes on the day of election. The Senate President said the APC government has failed the people of Osun State for failing to pay workers’ salaries and pensions for three years. He said since the Nigeria returned to civil rule in 1999, no state government has owed its workers for three years as Osun had done. He said: “Owing salaries for three, four, five months is understandable, but for a government to owe its workers for three years as Osun has been owing is unthinkable, “So, it is important there should be a change of government in Osun State, to usher in a government that will be ready to pay workers and pensioners regularly. “Good people of Osun, the suffering is enough. The election on Saturday is not about everybody. It is about the people of Osun. A government that will owe workers for three months should be sent parking. After Saturday, your incoming governor, Senator Adeleke, will be sworn in.”
