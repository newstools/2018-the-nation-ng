The management of Ekiti State University Ado-Ekiti (EKSU) has debunked online reports and insinuations that the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of the Governing Council, Mr. Dele Adesina, SAN has resigned. A statement on Thursday by Director, Information and Corporate Affairs, Mr. Ajibade Olubunmi, stressed that “there was nothing of that nature” as the Pro-Chancellor has been carrying out his assignments assiduously to make the university one of the best in
Nigeria. “Dele Adesina, SAN is still the Pro-Chancellor pursuing the goal of making the university visible internationally. “This statement is issued to disabuse the minds of the unsuspecting members of the public who might have been influenced by the fake report of resignation.”
