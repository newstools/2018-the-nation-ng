Over 2,059 corps members undergoing their three-week orientation at the Orientation Camp in Umunya, Oyi Local Government Area of Anambra State, have been praised for their integrity and honesty. The state Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Kehinde Aremu, gave the commendation when the Director-General of the scheme, Brigadier-General Suleiman Kazaure, visited the camp. Aremu said the items misplaced at the camp, including phones and money, had been recovered and returned. “There is something unique about this crop of corps members, which has given me more confidence about the curriculum of the orientation course. “Every lost or misplaced phone and money on this camp has been recovered. We don’t have any lost items on this camp. “This may sound little, but one thing it has shown is that these corps members can be trusted. It also shows that they are imbibing the teachings being impacted on them. “Being future leaders of this country, I can proudly say that if we continue to raise corps members that are honest as these ones, Nigeria is destined for greatness,” he explained. The coordinator also expressed joy at the level of patriotism and integration among the combined corps members from both states. He said: “Most often, we don’t even remember we have corps members outside Anambra with us. They’ve so much integrated that there will be weeping on the day we are departing from this camp.” Kazaure underscored the need for corps members to be security conscious and good ambassadors of the scheme by conducting themselves properly. He thanked Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano for donating an office complex to the scheme, saying the gesture would further boost the morale of the NYSC officials.
