Duru also called on the Lagos fans to come out in large numbers to support her teams, while urging stakeholders in the state to support her teams. “It is sad that we don’t have a board in the state because the sport associations are yet to be inaugurated. We don’t have any form of financial approval for the team. We, however, hope that handball stakeholders in the state will come to our aid,” Duru added. The winner goes home with the sum of N1, 000, 000, the second placed team will get N750, 000, while the third placed team will pocket N500, 000 in both categories.
