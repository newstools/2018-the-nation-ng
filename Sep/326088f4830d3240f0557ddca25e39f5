•Signs first act Reggae artiste Austin Peter, popularly known as King Wadada, has officially unveiled his new record label, Wadada World Class Entertainment, and has signed his first artiste, an Afro hip-hop singer and rapper, Zachariah Kelvin Lekan aka Blackelz. Speaking at the unveiling ceremony which held on Tuesday at Citadel De Continental Hotel & Suites, Ikeja, Lagos, King Wadada, said he intends to promote young musicians via the platform. “The reason I am launching this platform is that many people have neglected the young talents in this country. “This has pushed these talented ones especially the upcoming musicians astray, they now engage in all kind of fraudulent acts, prostitution and other illegal activities. Wadada World Class Entertainment aims to encourage and take talents off illegal things. That is why I am stepping out to start signing up this young, hardworking and determine act.” King Wadada who won the 2010 Kora Awards as Africa’s best reggae artist of the year further said that though he has been down for a while but he is back and better. “My fans home and abroad should expect a new album. I’m also coming out with a remix, ‘Holy Holy’ featuring Oritsefemi and a collaborating with 2baba in a song titled, ‘Ya Well’ (meaning God first in everything). Because the Bible says we have to go into the world and spread the gospel to all nation because Jesus Christ is going to be with us till the very end of ages that is why we go spiritual, so we have to pass the spiritual message to the president, governors, senators and other people in power for them to be spiritual and know the right thing to do at the right time and in the right way.” The new signee, Blackelz, was excited at the signing. “I’m so excited to be signed under the legendary, King Wadada’s label,” he said. “Watch out for my new single titled, ‘Baby’. The song is sending a spiritual message to all the mummies and babies all over the world. I am also coming out with his new album.”
