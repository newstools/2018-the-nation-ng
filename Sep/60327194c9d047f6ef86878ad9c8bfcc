As the people of Osun State go into the state governorship election on Saturday, the Inter Party Advisor Council (IPAC) has called for credible and free poll. Speaking at a press briefing before the IPAC members, including representatives of all the 48 political parties participating in the election staged a sensitization rally in the state, IPAC National Secretary, Barr. Aye Dakpokpo, advised the political gladiators not to see the election as a do-or-die affair. The IPAC scribe, who also advised the politicians to put the interest of the masses above their personal their own, said that IPAC was in Osun to sensitize the people of the state on the need to shun violence before, during and after the election. She said: “We are here in Osun to educate the populace on the need for free and fair election and you will agree with me that this is one of the strong pillars of democracy. We are focusing on no violence during the election and the need to minimize election malpractices. “So, it is important that political parties should not encourage violence during the election and that the reason for election is for people to elect a leader that will serve them and not to rule them.” She also urged the political parties and their candidates to accept the outcome of the election as long as it is accepted to be credible.
