The Inspector General of Police, IGP Ibrahim Idris has ordered the immediate dissolution of the IGP Special Tactical Squad (IGP-STS). The IG also ordered the re-deployment of all the personnel of the squad to other departments and formations of the Force. The disbandment may not be unconnected with the unauthorized raid of Chief Edwin Clark’s residence by some personnel in the unit. The Squad was headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Kolo Yusuf before the directive of the dissolution. A statement in Abuja on Friday night by the Force Spokesman, Ag. DCP Jimoh Moshood stated that senior officers attached to the erstwhile STS who were linked with complicity or played conspiracy roles in the unauthorized, illegal and unprofessional misconduct in the search of Clark’s residence in Asokoro are presently undergoing strict disciplinary procedures. Moshood also stated that the tactical operations and statutory core Police duties that the dissolved STS were charged with are now collapsed and will be carried out by other operational, investigative and response units of the Force.
