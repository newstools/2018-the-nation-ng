The Election Petition Tribunal hearing the dispute arising from the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State has shifted its venue to Abuja, the nation’s capital. The tribunal, chaired by Justice Sulaiman Belgore, on Monday, ordered the relocation of its sitting from Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, due to insecurity at the Ekiti State High Court, the former venue. The action followed alleged violence by some party members at the inaugural sitting, which the chairman said put the lives of lawyers, litigants and court workers at risk. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, are challenging the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate and governor-elect Dr. Kayode Fayemi, before the three-man jury. Lawyers to the parties at the tribunal demanded the change of venue to Abuja but the panel, in its ruling, promised to communicate a new venue to them within 48 hours. Fayemi’s lawyer Rafiu Balogun and Ekiti PDP Legal Adviser Mr. Sunday Olowolafe confirmed the change of venue in a telephone chat yesterday.
