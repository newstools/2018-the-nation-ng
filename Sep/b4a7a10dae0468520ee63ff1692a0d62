Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose yesterday faulted the Federal Government for using the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to alert the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) to prevent his escape at the end of his tenure. The governor said the move amounted to hypocrisy on the party of the government to place him on a watch list when he had written to the anti-graft agency of his intension to submit himself at the expiration of his tenure in October. He described the alleged alert as an opportunity for Federal agencies to loot the treasury in the name of investigating him. In a statement yesterday in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, by his Special Assistant of Public Communication and New Media, Lere Olayinka, the governor said the planned crackdown was an act of irresponsibility by the Federal Government under the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to him, Fayose promised to turn himself in to the EFCC for investigation on October 16, as he promised, and that the watch-list was needless.
