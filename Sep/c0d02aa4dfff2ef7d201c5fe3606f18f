The Ondo State government has said it had concluded arrangement to establish a Cancer Treatment Centre (CTC). At the maiden technical meeting of the Cancer Control Advisory Committee (CCAC), the governor’s wife Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu said the CTC is a dream come true for her. As a cancer survivor, Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu said she dedicated her life to fighting the disease and was passionate about starting a treatment centre that would be affordable and sustainable. She said a committee was set up to join the fight against the disease by using the treatment centre as a model. Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu noted that with government input and private participation, the level and rate of morbidity and mortality associated with cancer would be reduced. According to her, the establishment of the centre is a victory for the women of Ondo State as they will no longer die needlessly due to cancer. To get a better deal for the residents, Mrs Anyanwu-Akeredolu said there should be participation of the private sector, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as international and local donor agencies. The governor’s wife identified late presentation for cancer treatment as a major factor militating against successful treatment of cancer.
