Luka Modric has been crowned the 2018 FIFA Men’s Player of the year, after defeating fellow finalists Cristiano Ronaldo and Mohammed Salah at the London’s Royal Festival Hall on Monday night. His emergence follows his exploits with Croatia who reached the final of this year’s FIFA World Cup in Russia and with Real Madrid who retained the UEFA Champions League. This year’s edition brings an end to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi’s 10-year domination of the most prestigious award. Both Ronaldo and Messi failed to show up at the awards. ‘It was an unbelievable season, the best season in my life,’ said Modric, 33. ‘I’m very proud of everything I achieved this year. It will be remembered, for sure, forever,’ said Modric after receiving his award. Nine different categories were decided with the Goalkeeper of the Year going to Belgium goalkeeper, Thibaut Courtois, while Didier Deschamps won the Coach of the Year for guiding France to win the World Cup in Russia. In doing so, Deschamps becomes the third man in history to win the World Cup both as a player and a manager, joining Brazil’s Mario Zagallo and Germany’s Franz Beckenbauer. Liverpool’s Mohammed Salah won the Puskas award in recognition of his strike against Everton last season in the English Premier League which saw him wriggle past three defenders to score. Interestingly Salah’s goal was adjudged the best ahead of Gareth Bale’s bicycle kick against Liverpool during the UEFA Champions League final. Olympic Lyon manager Reynald Pedros was voted the Women’s Coach of the Year after leading the French side to a league and UEFA Women’s Champions League double last season. The women’s player award went to Brazil’s Marta who beat Lyon duo Ada Hegerberg and Dzsenifer Marozsan. Marta had previously won the-defunct FIFA World Player of the Year award five years in a row between 2006 and 2010. The voting system is decided by national team managers, national captains, media representatives and an online vote.
