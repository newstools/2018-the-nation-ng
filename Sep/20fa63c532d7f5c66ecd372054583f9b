On why he is taking the show outside Nigeria, Senator disclosed that Nigerians in the UK have been part of his success story. “UK was my first international trip then under the umbrella of Crack ya ribs, the Julius Agwu brand in 2008,” he said. “So Nigerians in the UK have always encouraged us with good positive vibes. They actually made request for the brand to come to the UK … So I gave it a thought and then reached out to my promoter friends in the UK – Akinlolu Jekins of Akinlolu Jenkins and Co Ltd and James Efe Aghedo of Efoski entertainment – who saw a need to put up the show. They are basically my partners in the show.”
