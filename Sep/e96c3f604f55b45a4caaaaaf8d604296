If you are confused as to why Beverly Osu has been on the typing hands and speaking lips of most Nigerians, here is the reason. Prior to the photoshoot done by Beverly Osu where she was dressed as a “hot looking nun” for the cover page of the Taylor magazine, the pictures have turned out to bring more controversy from Nigerians who have refused to turn deaf ears and blind eye to the pictures. To most, the picture is an insult to the catholic faith. To some, the photoshoot is merely an art.  After several cyber abuses towards her, Beverly Osu has come out to defend herself and the picture inclusive. Taking to social media, Beverly has said that Reverend Fathers and sisters smoke in real life. “In any case, reverend sisters and fathers smoke in real life which has not been established as a sin to my knowledge. Dear Nigerians I don’t do what I do for your applause…If these images came out for a movie, will it be ok? It is funny how you all just sinned because of a beautiful artistic picture: I laugh in Hebrew MATHEW 7: 1-5,” she wrote.
