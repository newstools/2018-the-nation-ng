Former Minister of Interior Comrade Abba Morro has said going to the senate is not all about legislation, but also about impacting the people’s life meaningfully. Morro, who bought and returned his nomination form for Benue South Senatorial zone on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), cautioned the electorates against “money-bag politicians who would abandon them after winning elections”. The former minister wants to succeed Senator David Mark who is a PDP presidential aspirant. After his screening yesterday at Hallyday Hotel in Makurdi, Morro said he would deepen the process of law making by attracting quality projects to his constituency. According to him, having impacted positively on humanity, especially in Benue South, as chairman of Okpokwu Local Government Area, ALGON chairman and later minister, he knows the yearnings and aspiration of his people for good governance. Morro said his priority as a senator would be the completion of critical projects in Benue South, such as Otobi Dam, Skills acquisition centres.
