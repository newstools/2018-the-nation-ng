Up and coming hip hop artiste, Okunola Babatunde Ayobami, known as Clevatee-Wokilumo, is back with another street song titled ‘Omi Tau’, produced by Gizzybadboy. Though the new song is enjoying rotation at clubs and some radio stations, the artiste who is yet to secure a recording contract, is not allowing that to slow him down. “This new single is coming of the successful release of “Kyrpo Kyrpo” and “Potom” both released this year,” he said. “Though I have a lot of songs recorded, I do not want to rush them out. That is why I am releasing them one after the other; so that I can have something when I eventually secure a recording contract.” Other singles to his credit are ‘A ma duro’, ‘To-Ba-Be’, ‘Run Da Streetz (a visual)’ and ‘O YA ELP.’ The artiste who has shared stage with names like Adol, Jayru, Wale Waves, Tuwyze and others came into limelight in 2012 in Ibadan, Oyo State and moved to Lagos in 2016.
