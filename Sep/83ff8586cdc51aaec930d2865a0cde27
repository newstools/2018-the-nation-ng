Everton boss Marco Silva says that a poor decision to allow Arsenal’s second goal to stand changed the game against the Blues today. Arsenal ran out 2-0 winners at The Emirates despite a positive showing from Everton and an encouraging performance up until the two goals. The second was shown to be clearly offside, but officials on the pitch allowed the goal to stand, which will likely spark even more debate about whether or not VAR should be used in the Premier League – although obviously not as much debate as if it had happened to one of the Media Top Six Sides. After the match, Silva said “The result didn’t reflect the match. During the match, we had four or five chances to score. “Our team came to play and press high, but their goalkeeper is the best player on the pitch, and I think it reflects our performance. “The result is disappointing for us. They had one chance and scored, and we created a lot of chances but didn’t score. “It is a clear offside for their second goal and it is a decision at an important stage because, at 1-0, we would have kept creating problems for them. I understand the job is difficult.”
