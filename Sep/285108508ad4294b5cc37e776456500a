The ‘Assurance’ crooner took to his Instagram handle @Davidoofficial to announce that he had cancelled the latter part of his concert in the U.S. to concentrate on serving his fatherland. “Due to scheduling conflicts and National Youth Service Corps commitments in Nigeria, the remaining date for the `Davido Locked Up Tour’ has been cancelled,” he said. “Refunds will be made available at point of purchase. Davido and his team are working hard to reschedule all dates plus add new dates in the near future. “I love you guys and see you soon. Houston, Dallas, L.A and San Francisco will be giving you all the new dates soon. “I apologise to all my fans, but duty calls! Shout out to all the fans who sold out each City so far.OBO,’’ he wrote. The NYSC scheme is obligatory for all graduates of higher institutions in the country. Davido graduated from Babcock University in Ogun State in 2015, with a degree in music. After undergoing his NYSC registration on Aug. 29, the singer left the Lagos Orientation Camp in preparation for his show.
