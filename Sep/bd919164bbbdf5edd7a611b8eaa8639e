Two girls from the same parents reportedly sustained severe injuries in a kerosene explosion in Ogbunike, Oyi local government area of Anambra State. The victims, Chinenye Ezeh (16) and Kamsi Ezeh (8) were said to have been involved in the inferno following power outage in the area. A neighbor who preferred anonymity, said Kamsi had brought a kerosene container to her elder sister, Chinenye to fill a lantern. He however said the sister did not put out the lantern fire while pouring the kerosene into the lantern. “The lantern suddenly exploded, leaving both of them with severe and life threatening burns,” he said. The neighbor added that the victims were rushed to First Foundation Hospital and Maternity, Umunnachi, where they were being treated. Reacting, the father of the victims, Mr. Godwin Ikechukwu Ezeh, a native of Imezi Owa in Ezeagu local government area of Enugu state, appealed to both Anambra and Enugu state governments and spirited individuals to assist them in offsetting the hospital bills.
