Kunle Oyatomi, the All Progressives  Congress (APC) spokesman in Osun,  on Friday, said governor-elect, Gboyega Oyetola, would build on the legacies of Gov. Rauf Aregbesola. Oyatomi said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after the announcement of  Oyetola as the winner of the gubernatorial election by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC)  in Osogbo. He commended  Aregbesola for  delivering  good democratic dividends  which had transformed the state. Oyatomi also commended INEC for its display of professionalism and the security agencies for ensuring the election was peaceful. He, however, urged the people of the state to support the incoming governor in achieving the mandate of making Osun greater than its present status. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Oyetola polled 255,505 to defeat PDP’s Ademola Adeleke, who had  255,023 votes.
