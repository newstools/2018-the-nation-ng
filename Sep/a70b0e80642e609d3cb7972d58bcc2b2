The Lagos-Badagry Expressway is in deplorable condition, the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC),  has said, warning motorists against speeding on it. The Badagry-Seme Command of FRSC told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Badagry:  “We must be sincere with ourselves, the road is in a deplorable state.” Its unit commander, Fatai Bakare, said the corps had written to the Ministry of Works and the agencies of the government about the road. “It is part of our duty to do a monthly audit of roads in Badagry up to Seme border and other federal roads under our control. “We have audited the Lagos-Seme Expressway this month and submitted our reports to our headquarters, for onward submission to the affected ministry and agencies. “To be candid, the Federal Government is not folding its arms on ensuring that the road is good. “Recently, the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Fashola, said the road contract has been awarded,” Bakare said. He quoted the minister as saying that the ministry had resolved the problems surrounding the continuous construction of the road. The commander hoped that the contractor handling the project would soon return to site. He said officials from the unit had been deployed to the bad portion to prevent crashes. Bakare said the unit had started an aggressive public enlightenment programme to educate residents on the need to have accident-free `ember’ months. “I just came back from the popular Badagry roundabout, where I addressed motorists and distributed handbills,” he said. NAN reports that motorists, passengers and road transport unions have expressed their dissatisfaction over the state of the Lagos-Badagry expressway, describing it as a deathtrap.
