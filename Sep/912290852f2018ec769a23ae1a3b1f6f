•Likely out of the country THE whereabouts of immediate past Minister of Finance Kemi Adeosun is unknown. Attempts by our correspondent to track her whereabouts to determine if she was in the country proved abortive. Though her phone rang, it was with a tone for roaming calls outside the nation’s shores. Attempts to reach her media aides were unsuccessful with their phone lines switched off. When contacted an official of the Ministry in the protocol department said it was “likely Madam has traveled out of the country this morning.” Our correspondent’s checks revealed the only airline that could have been available is British Airways with an 8:05am departure time with 14:35pm London arrival time. The need to locate the former minister followed alarms raised by the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Adeosun may have left the country or planning to leave to avoid arrest and prosecution over her admission that the NYSC certificate she presented was forged.
