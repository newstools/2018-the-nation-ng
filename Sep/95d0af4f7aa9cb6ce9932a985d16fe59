A High Court of the Federal Capital Territory sitting in Jabi has awarded a farmer Mr Samuel Dozo for an unlawful arrest and detention by the police. However Mr Dozo had sued the police for violation of his fundamental human right. His lawyer Mr Adolphus Okoro told the court that the police unlawfully arrested and detaining him on the 28th of March in a special anti-robbery cell without  trial and also demanded the sum of N70,000. Justice Nasiru Meru in her ruling on Tuesday said continued detention of the applicant without trial is illegal and that he should be charged to court immediately without delay. She added “I hereby award the sum of N1m to the applicant as exemplary damages for his fundamental human right”
