He was a non-career diplomat and hailed from Plateau State. He was due for burial last night in Doha, capital of Qatar. Foreign Affairs Minister Geoffrey Onyeama expressed shock over the death of the ambassador. He prayed that God might grant Wase’s family and the nation the fortitude to bear the loss.
