*Ndidi, Iheanacho lose It was yet a no show situation for Nigeria international Victor Moses, as he was left out in Chelsea squad that hammered visiting Cardiff 4-1 at the Stamford Bridge on Saturday. Moses who is on the verge of returning to the National team after bidding goodbye to international football has not tested action in the last three league matches. He was last in action against Huddersfield Town stepping in as late substitute for Pedro in the 81st minute. Goal feast for the Blues on Saturday began in the 37th minute with a strike by Eden Hazard who enjoyed an assist from Oliver Giroud. That was however 21 minutes after visiting Cardiff had shot into the lead thanks to Ivorian import Souleymane Bamba. But that was the much the visitors could do as the flood gate of goals opened for the Maurizio Sarri tutored side. It was a hat trick for Hazard who was on target again in the 44th and 80th minutes respectively. Teammate Willian finally nailed the coffin in the 83rd minute. While it was a no show situation for Moses at the Bridge, same cannot be said of compatriots Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho who were in action for Leicester against a rampaging Bournemouth. While Ndidi saw full 90 minutes action, Iheanacho was in action for 29 minutes after stepping in as replacement for Demarai Gray. It was however not a sweet song for the duo as Leicester were beaten 4-2 in front of 10,543 Spectators at the Vitality Stadium.
