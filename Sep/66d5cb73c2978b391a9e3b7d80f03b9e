The Ganiyu Abiodun Foundation (GAF), in partnership with Eko Club International (ECI) Medical Mission, last Saturday offered medical services to Lagosians. The event was held at Okota Baptist Church playing ground, Ali Dada Street, Okota, Isolo, Lagos from 10am. Medical personnel rendered services to the constituents of Oshodi/Isolo Federal Constituency II and the public. The turnout was impressive, as the young and elderly took advantage of the foundation’s initiative to receive medical treatment. Free drugs and eye glasses were given to people. The recipients hailed the foundation and former Lagos State Commissioner for Works, Ganiyu Abiodun Johnson, whom they described as a man who cared for the well-being of people. They urged him not to relent. Johnson, an engineer, said he was impressed by the turnout. He reiterated his commitment to people’s welfare and promised to sustain the programme.
