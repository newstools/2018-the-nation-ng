ONE of the aspirants jostling for the Lagos All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has not withdrawn from the race, it campaign organisation said yesterday. Spokesman of the Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu Campaign Organisation (BOSCO) Sesan Daini said there was no truth in the report that Sanwo-Olu, a former Lagos Commissioner for Establishment & Training has bowed out of the race. Describing the report as misleading, Daini said that Sanwo-Olu would participate in the APC primary. According to him, the report, which he blamed on jittery members of the opposition, never emanated from the aspirant. He said: “We hereby state unequivocally that the purported press statement did not emanate from our principal, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, rather it is the handwork of jittery members of opposition to malign our principal and mislead the public. “For the umpteenth time, Sanwo-Olu has not and will not withdraw from the race and he is ready for the party primary slated for the September 29. “BOSCO is not oblivious of the fact that these cheap attempts to mislead and hoodwink members of our party and the public will be made by these disgruntled elements, but we will continue to repeal their falsehood with facts.” Daini said that Sanwo-Olu remained committed to his campaign, adding that he would not be distracted from continuing the set goals to serve Lagos people. He said: “Our principal remains committed to his campaign while still consulting with party leaders and members and would not be distracted by cheap blackmail like this. “We want to use this opportunity to urge our teeming party faithful to troop out en masse on Saturday to cast their votes for Babajide Sanwo-Olu to be the flag bearer of the APC.”
