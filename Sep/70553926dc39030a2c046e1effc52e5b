A leading All Progressives Congress(APC) Governorship aspirant in Sokoto State, Farouk Malami Yabo has denied withdrawing his aspiration to contest the state first seat. Yabo said he had never contemplated such nor was he in the race to withdraw from what he is determined to accomplish for the prosperity of the state and its people. ” My attention has been drawn to a false statement circulating to suggest that I have withdrawn from the race to the Sokoto Government House In a statement he personally issued on Monday in reaction to what he described as false information being circulated alleging that he had withdrawn from the race to the Sokoto Government House, Yabo insisted that he is fully and surely in the contest with confidence braced by the overwhelming support of Sokoto people. ” My attention has been drawn to a false statement circulating to suggest that I have withdrawn from the race to the Sokoto Government House. On that note therefore, I hereby, categorically state that I am not in the race to withdraw in the first place, rather, I am in it to rescue our dear state from terminal illness that bedevils our chances of development.” According to the two time former Commissioner of Finance and Local Government respectively, democracy was all about number, strength of popularity, competence, credibility and acceptability. He stressed that” democracy is a game of number where every single decision is taken by the people and for them. So this struggle is not my show but of the good people of sokoto state. ” I also want to on behalf of my humble self, my supporters, the APC family and the entire people of sokoto state assure the general public that, at no point I intend or would consider withdrawing from this contest for whatever reason. ” Sokoto belongs to all of us and we must work hard enough to restore it’s past glory no matter how tough or rough the road may be. In God we trust”, he said.
