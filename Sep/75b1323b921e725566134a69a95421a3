The Minister of  Industry,  Trade and  Investment,  Okechukwu Enalema yesterday said he played no part  in the appointment of Ugo Ikembam as the Graduate Employment  Project (GEP) Consultant, a  Word Bank  programwe. He said there was an open bidding,  where  Ugo  Ikemba who is the present consultant came second. He said:  “The person that came first on the bidding list gave the  World Bank conditions,  that he has to be paid in foreign currency,  and they refused, that was how Ugo Ikemba got the job. “I need to put this  controversy to rest.  I did not appoint the Consultant,  he went through the process like all others.  He got the offer after the man that came first refused to accept the job. Enelama said the government is working on functional free trade zones. “We are working on three economic zones,  the Eyimba City Park,  Kano  City Park and Calabar Free Trade Zone, saying this will promote employment and  give youths the opportunity to acquire skills.  We are also working on consistent policy and initiative and transparency. He said trade, market access and trade facilitation have positioned  the industry to be competitive. “I want to state here that trade facilitation efforts are all connected. “Trade remedies,  protecting the economy from dumping so that  ECOWAS  rules are not abused. The government is also using the social intervention fund that relates to  Small and Medium  Enterprise and  SMSEs.”
