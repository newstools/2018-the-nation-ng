A 25-year-old man, Abdulmumini Oseni, who on Friday appeared before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly belonging to a cult known as ‘Eiye’ confraternity, had been granted bail. The accused is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and belonging to an unlawful society. Oseni, who resides at Seriki Oro in Ikeja area of Lagos, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Lucky Ihiehie, told the court that the offences were committed on Sept. 1 at about 4:00 a.m. at Gowon Estate, Egbeda Area of Lagos State. Oseni and three others now at large, invaded the complainants’ house with axe and cutlass and introduced themselves as ‘Eiye’ Confraternity members. According to the complainant, Mr Abubakar Ahmed, they told him that they came to treat his misdeeds. They said they fought against intimidation and that the complainant shouldn’t dare them. Ihiehie told the police that Oseni pointed a gun at the complainants head and told him to remove his clothes as they beat him up with belt, cable wire and inflicted severe injuries on his body. He said they (accused) used their phones to video the whole thing and later moved the complainant to an unknown place where he was forced to do a mobile transfer of N30, 000 into one of their accounts before they stopped beating him. The case was reported to the Anti-Cultism Unit, Gbagada, on Sept. 9 and the complainant told the police that he didn’t know the men but could be able to identify them. The offences contravened Sections 42 (9) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Magistrate, Mrs E. Kubeinje, granted the accused bail in the sum of N50, 000 with two sureties in like sum. She said the sureties must show proof of means of livelihood with an evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government for two years. The case was adjourned until Nov. 11. NAN
