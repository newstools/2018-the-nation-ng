The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has said that part of the dividends of democracy was respect for press freedom, rule of law, human and trade union rights. It, implored politicians and law enforcement agencies to respect these rights. In a communiqué issued after its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting at the Labour House, Abuja, the NLC advised reporters to be fair and credible in their reportage. The NLC decried the mounting arrears of unpaid pension and gratuity, asking states to give priority to the payment of pension and gratuity. “The NEC also urged that the last tranche of the Paris Club Refund should only be released if it is ascertained that it would be used to settle outstanding pension and gratuity by state governments,” NLC said. NLC observed that federal civil servants who retired under the contributory pension scheme in July, last year, have not been paid their entitlements, saying it has led to the death of some retirees. “The NEC noted that the problem was from the Federal Ministry of Finance, leading to the death of some retirees. “The NEC demands that the Federal Ministry of Finance should do the needful and expeditiously remit all accrued benefits to PENCOM and ensure that subsequent remittances are done as and when due,” it said.
