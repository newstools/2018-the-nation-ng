President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday in Abuja met with Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode at the State House, Abuja. The mission of the governor at the Presidential Villa was not known. It was after the meeting of the Progressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), which dragged into the late hours of Wednesday. Ambode is seeking a renewal of mandate for a fresh four-year term. He has challengers in two former Lagos commissioners – Babjide Sanwo-Olu (Establishment &Training) and Dr. Obafemi Hamzat (Works & Infrastructure). The trio would contest for the APC governorship ticket at a scheduled shadow poll.
