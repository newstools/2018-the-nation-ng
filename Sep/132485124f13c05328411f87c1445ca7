The All Progressives Youth Forum (APYF), the youth wing of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara state is set to mobilize thousands of youths across the state to ensure APC emerges victorious in the presidential, governorship elections and all other positions across the state in the 2019 elections. The group added that “That this is the time to liberate the people of the state from the grip of tyrannical leadership.” State Coordinator of APYF Tunde Salau added that the forum is “looking forward to organizing an interactive forum with the aspirants; wherein the governorship aspirants will have a face-to-face discussion with the youths on issues or challenges affecting the youth and how they (the aspirants) plan to tackle such challenges if they eventually occupy the number one seat in the state. Comrade Salau hailed Minister of Information and Culture Alhaji Lai Mohammed, and the state APC chair Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa, for organizing a successful parley for all APC governorship aspirants in the state. APC on Wednesday this week organized a parley with all the 12 governorship aspirants in the state. Salau said members of the forum were impressed with the success of the programme being the first of its kind in the history of not only in Kwara, but in Nigerian politics. “We believe that there was no place in the history of Nigerian politics where aspirants of the same political party were given an opportunity to present their manifestos to the electorates in an organised setting. He added that “This singular act demonstrates the uncommon leadership charisma of the minister and the party chairman Bashir Bolarinwa for encouraging transparency, accountability and unity in the party and among the aspirants who saw themselves as brothers and partners in progress during the programme.”
