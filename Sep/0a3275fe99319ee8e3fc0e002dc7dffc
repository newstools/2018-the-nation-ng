Have you heard about the song by Nicki Minaj “They need a rapper like me?  Well if you have, then compare it to what could pass like Jose Mourinho’ version at a press conference Friday, where he addressed issues including allegations that he is holding down Marcus Rashford. Mourinho took a swipe at pundits insisting that they are obsessed with him and cannot think of anything else to talk about. His rant is coming ahead of resumption of premier league matches Saturday after the international break. Manchester united re-open their campaign against Watford on Saturday, and the embattled special one whose special nature has been questioned recently in some quarters following not too impressive run by Manchester United, had this to say” ‘I can expect that on Sunday I’m going to be highly criticised for not playing him (Rashford) at Watford tomorrow because some of the boys are really obsessed with me,’ the Portuguese said during a monologue of over four minutes on the suspended Rashford. ‘Some of them have a problem with some compulsive lies, so I can expect some of them will wake up on Sunday… and always the thing that comes to their mind is Jose Mourinho. ‘Some of the people everybody knows have double salaries, they work also for the clubs and of course they are not independent and they conduct things in the direction they want. ‘That’s obvious, human, is natural, not ethical but I accept. I feel sorry for them; there are more interesting things than Jose Mourinho.’ He insisted while reeling out all playing times and minutes Rasford has done under him that he is doing far more than his Premier League rivals to develop young English talent.
