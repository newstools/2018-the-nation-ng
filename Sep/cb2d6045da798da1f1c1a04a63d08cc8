He said already operational order had been issued to the Area commanders and divisional police officers to ensure security of lives and property of residents. “We have put in place security measures against any form of security threats in our areas of jurisdictions,” he said. Yakadi called on residents to cooperate with police and other security agencies as uniform and plain clothes security personnel had since been deployed to motor parks, markets and recreation centers to guarantee their safety.
