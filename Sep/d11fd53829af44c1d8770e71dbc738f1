The Anambra State Coordinator, National Youth Service Corps (NYSC), Mr. Aremu Kehinde has expressed appreciation to the state governor, Willie Obiano for donating a new office complex to the organization. The Coordinator made the disclosure on Saturday during the swearing in ceremony of the 2018 Batch ‘B’ (Stream II) Orientation course in Umunya, Oyi local council area of the state. He said the need for relocation of the office became expedient following the space congestion challenge, occasioned by steady expansion of the scheme since 27 years of its existence in the state. “The community town hall which had housed the scheme since 1991 the state was created was no longer accommodating us in view of the steady expansion of the administrative structure. “We made the complaint to the governor and after seeing reason for a more befitting structure, graciously donated a building complex to us,” he added. Kehinde who also lauded Obiano for being among the state governors that had been faithful in the payment of allowances of corps members, said the magnanimity was a demonstration of his passion for the youths in the state. He urged the corps members to reciprocate the gesture through their commitment and selfless service both to their host communities and to the state in general. Declaring the orientation course open, Governor Obiano challenged the corps members to take the service year seriously, saying the success of the programme depended on the foundation laid during the orientation camp. Obiano, who was represented by the Secretary to the State Government, Prof. Solo Chukwulobelu, urged them to take advantage of the training to equip themselves to become job creators and not seekers, pledging provision of enabling environment for maximum productivity. A total of 1261 and 746 corps members deployed to Anambra and Enugu states respectively, participated in the ceremony.
