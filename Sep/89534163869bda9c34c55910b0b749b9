A 28-year-old man, Kelvin Michael, who allegedly raped a woman to death, was yesterday arraigned in Ota, Ogun. Michael Tunde Akinola,  of  No. 21 Abebi St., Sango-Ota, is facing murder charge at an Ota Magistrates’ Court. A state counsel, Mr. Bale Nimnan, told the court that the accused committed the offence on August  14 at 11.00 a.m. at his residence in Sango-Ota. Nimnan said the accused had several rounds of sex with the 40-year-old woman, Monsura Idowu, which resulted in her death. Counsel to the accused, Tunde Akinola,  urged the magistrate to grant the accused pending advice from the State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). He noted that since advice from the DPP usually takes a long time, the accused may be locked up  longer than necessary. Most accused persons stay between five to six years in prison pending DPP’s advice, he said. The offence contravened Section 325 of the Criminal Code, Laws of Ogun, 2006. In his ruling, Chief Magistrate Mathew Akinyemi, granted the accused bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum. Akinyemi said the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and should be gainfully employed with evidence of tax payment to the Ogun Government. The case was adjourned until Oct. 19.
