The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has split. The splinter group has returned to the defunct National Union of Nigerian Students (NUNS). NUNS, proscribed by the Federal Military Government led by Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo in April 1978, was resuscitated after the election of its national executives at the Kaduna Polytechnic at the weekend. The executives are led by Comrade Salaudeen Lukman, a student of Geology and Mineral Science from Kwara State University, Malete, Ilorin. Others are: Faruk Isah, vice- president, National Affairs, Ladoke Akintola University, Ogbomosho; Abdulazeez Musa Alhassan, vice-president, External Affairs; Abdulazeez Musa Alhassan from Bayero University Kano; Okonkwo Collins, vice-president, Special Duties Uni Uli, Anambra State and Odugbemi Olohunfemi Ojotina, public relations officer, Kogi State University, among others. Addressing reporters after their emergency meeting, the President of Second Republic NUNS, Comrade Lukman, said: “NUNS is a child of necessity to salvage a recurring problem of loss of ideology, political hijack, display of hooliganism/thuggery and mass domination of non-students in the existing apex students’ body, hence we shall not deviate from the core values and principle of operation in constructive alutarism with diplomacy.”
