Niger State Governor Abubakar Sani Bello is the only governorship aspirant in the All Progressives Conmgress (APC) chapter. Other aspirants-Alhaji Abubakar Katcha and Alhaji Mahmud Sani, who is the Chairman of the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), have allegedly withdrawn from the race.  Chairman had indicated interest to pick forms.  The chairman of the party, Jibril Imam, an engineer,  said ther governor has no rival. He added: “We can authoritatively tell you that the party is not aware of any candidate but the incumbent governor. However, it is possible that some other persons may have purchased forms and  may be screened from Abuja, but APC at the state level have not received any declaration of intent from anybody apart from the seating governor.” Imam said the party did not prevent any chieftain from joining the race, adding that all elective positions were open for interested members.  The chapter will organise direct primaries for all positions.
