The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) yesterday dismissed as untrue reports that the take over of 9Mobile by Teleology Holdings Limited, its preferred bidder was being delayed by the telco’s $100million outstanding debts. The Executive Vice Chairman of the NCC, Prof Umar Garba Danbatta who spoke to reporters  on the sideline at the Second Stakeholders Forum with the Academia at the Transcorp Hotel, Abuja, said there was truth in the report. He said while he took questions from reporters in Durban, South Africa during the recently concluded Intenational Telecommunications Union (ITU) Conference, that he did not allude to any debt profile regarding 9mobile. On the necessity for a strong synergy between the NCC, the Academia and  telcos, Prof Danbatta said the stakeholders forum was organised to discuss matters that are germane to the development of the telecoms industry in the country. He added that the topic for this year’s forum: Academia, Accelerator for Innovation, Industry Growth and Sustainability, was in line with ITU vision for ICT related fields globally. He said: ” At this same venue last year, we promised an encore, a continuity of the stakeholders forum with Academia which we hope will continue to provide us the platform to engage each other on how the academia can be more involved with the telecoms industry, develop more tangible relationships with the operators, while seeking opportunities to be more engaged in the activities of the sector and contribute to produce the much needed manpower.”
