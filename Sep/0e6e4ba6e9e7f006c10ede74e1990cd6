The African Scholars Care Initiative (ASCI) has announced that it will renovate the learning centre at the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camp located at Durumi, Abuja. Founder, ASCI, Joy Onumajuru, said this during the foundation’s visit to camp in celebration of UN World Humanitarian Day in collaboration with the Office of the Most Beautiful Girl in Abuja Advocate. The visitation, which was themed ‘Rights to a Conducive Learning Environment,’ involved the distribution of brand new desks, chairs, exercise books, food supplies, mathematical sets, fans, white boards, markers, etc Onumajuru said: “We are here today to let the children in the camp know that they have the right to a conducive learning environment. “We have brought many supplies in order to arrange at least one class for them here at the learning center. We want to renovate it.” Onumajuru also implored the Federal Government and private sector to get involved in social responsibility by assisting foundations such as ASCI. “Government should sponsor the outreaches so that people can be helped.  We must help so that the less-privileged will have hope for the future,” she said. The Most Beautiful Girl in Abuja Advocate, Romina Momoh, harped on the importance of humanitarian presence and donations in the IDP camps. “Education without a doubt is the bedrock for sustainable development and a solid foundation upon which every positive of life and indeed humanity can be achieved. “These factors have necessitated my strategic partnership with ASCI to further establish our resolve to promote the course of humanity,” she said.
