The World Health Organisation (WHO) has called for urgent global action to end Tuberculosis (TB), the world’s deadliest infectious disease which claims 4000 lives daily.  The call was made at a press conference to launch the 2018 Global Tuberculosis report, held yesterday at the United Nations headquarters in New York. The report provides a comprehensive assessment of the TB epidemic, with data on disease trends and response in 205 countries and territories. It also outlined a monitoring framework with data on SDG indicators and a graphic country profiles from the top 30 high-TB-burden countries. According to the report, Nigeria’s TB treatment coverage stands at 24 percent with 155 000 deaths, including 35 000 deaths among people with HIV.  Also, 24, 000 people fell ill with drug-resistant TB while 58, 000 people living with HIV fell ill with TB. The TB cases in Nigeria were attributed to five risks namely alcohol, smoking, diabetes, HIV and undernourishment. The Director, Global TB Programme, WHO, Dr Tereza Kasaeve, called for urgent actions to close the gaps and reach all people affected with TB worldwide with proper care. In a chat with The Nation, Dr Irene Koek, the Deputy Administrator for Global Health, US Agency for International Development (USAID) charged leaders from African countries to recognizeTB as an important issue that demands urgent attention with political commitment which invests in the needs of patients and health systems. Heads of State are expected to meet at the first-ever United Nations General Assembly High-level Meeting on TB on 26 September in New York, to commit to accelerate the TB response.
