An average of 1.2 million children are immunized every six month in Ogun State, as part of efforts to ensure effective health care delivery to the citizenry, the State Commissioner for Health, Dr. Babatunde Ipaye has disclosed. Making the disclosure at a community health outreach, organized by The Collective Club in Sagamu, Dr. Ipaye said the immunization included the use of vitamin A supplementation, to prevent complications of conditions, thereby reducing unnecessary spending by parents. The Commissioner, through his Media Aide, Miss. Omolola Awolana, said the State has been able to put cholera at bay through investment in primary healthcare, adding that massive health education and nutritional supplementation were some of the preventive interventions put in place, to prevent the outbreak of the disease. According to him, ‘’What we have done more deliberately is to focus on  primary interventions which are largely of two strategies, the first is massive health education on what we call primary prevention and the second is to give preventive intervention which includes immunization, that is what we have done. We immunize an average of 1.2 million children every six month, so how will you have outbreak of diseases, when you have practically immunized all your children?’’ The President, The Collective Club, Mr. Samson Ogunjimi while underscoring the essence of the outreach, said the Club chooses to support the government by focusing on neglected non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and blood pressure, as government could not do it alone. Beneficiaries of the outreach, Amusa Oluwatosin and Jiro Ejiroka appreciated the organizers of the event for the initiative, advising citizens to utilize the opportunity provided by the State government and private organizations to know their health status, so as to live a healthy live.
