Former National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief John Odigie-Oyegun,  has said that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was in order to declare last Saturday’s governorship elections in Osun State inconclusive. Oyegun said INEC acted in line with the Electoral Act. Oyegun who with reporters in Benin City, the Edo State capital, said the APC led Federal Government should be commended for allowing democracy to prevail. He said Osun people freely expressed their will and ensured that the votes count. The former Edo governor also appealed to the electorate in the affected wards in Osun to reward the goodworks of the APC on Thursday for ensuring free, fair and credible election in their state. The former chairman explained that he sticked with President Muhammadu Buhari because he represents the light house the nation needs at the moment for economic growth. He said: “In a country that lacks heroes, Buhari stands out. We must represent the very positive traits of integrity and honesty in him. I believe that is what the nation needs now. “Buhari is that light house that we need in a society that is enveloped in darkness of corruption, lack of standard, ethics and morality. “He may not be perfect like any other human being, but he is what the nation needs at the moment to ensure steady growth.”
