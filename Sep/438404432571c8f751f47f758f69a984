A 28-year-old housewife, Mautin Idowu, yesterday urged a Badagry Customary Court to dissolve her five-year-old marriage to Michael to prevent her from committing suicide. The petitioner threatened to jump into a river if the court did not grant her request. Mautin, a teacher, said she was tired of her husband’s disrespect for her family, his intolerable behaviour and lack of love. She said: “I was in 300-level at the Lagos State University Distance Learning Programme when I met Michael Idowu in 2012. “He was a teacher and I was teaching with my National Certificate in Education (NCE) then; he proposed to me but I rejected because he was older than me. “Michael told me that his wife divorced him with two sons and out of pity, I fell in love with him. Few months after, he took me to meet his family. When I got pregnant in 2013, we got married and he paid my dowry. “But when I was seven months pregnant, I discovered that my husband had two wives and six children which he hid from me during our courtship. He lied to me, my world broke down but I survived the trauma. “Michael kept me in a two-room apartment in a bushy area, but I still managed to have my baby, “the petitioner said. She told the court that her husband abandoned her and her baby. The petitioner added that he disrespected her parents by shouting at her mother and hanging up the phone on her father. The respondent was not in court. The court’s President, Mr Sakirudeen Adekola, adjourned the case till October 18 to give room for amicable settlement of the case.
