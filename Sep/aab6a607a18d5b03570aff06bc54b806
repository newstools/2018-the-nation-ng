The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) yesterday predicted intense flooding in 12 states of the federation. The states are Kebbi, Niger, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra, Edo, Delta, Rivers and Bayelsa. There is also the River Benue axis which includes Benue, Adamawa and Taraba. The Director General of NEMA, Mustapha Maihaja, disclosed this during the stakeholder’s forum on flooding in Abuja, saying that all the indices of flooding in 2012 are repeating themselves. According to him, “there is need for preparedness. We should be ready for any eventuality. We should invigorate our enlightenment campaign in an effort to enlighten the people to further inform the frontline states in a more aggressive manner. “Presently, the water level in Lokoja is 9.89 level with a discharge of 326. The same depth in 2012. It is clear that all he indices that took place on flooding in 2012 have resurfaced. “One of the ways to take care of this situation is that we have set up a committee of five group, three persons from each sector. They will go to the villages and cities that will be affected, use all avenues to enlighten the people and make sure they are well informed.” He said the resolution on the matter was that State Emergency Management Agencies (SEMAs) should ensure that drainages are cleared. He said: “People build on water channels thereby blocking drainages where water should pass. All this has to be taken care of. “NEMA will champion the clearing of drainages and houses built on waterways in the states by providing 30% funding. Dangote will provide 30% while the federal government will give 40% to ensure clearance of drainages and clear waterways. “The Ministry of housing has to come in here to provide emergency housing scheme to these states. And in a safer parts of the states where flood cannot get to, what we are working on is long term, medium term and short term plans.
