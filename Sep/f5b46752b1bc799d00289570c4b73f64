The All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday disqualified two ministers from contesting tomorrow’s governorship primary. The Minister of Communication, Adebayo Shittu and Minister of Women Affairs Hajia Jummai Alhassan, are among the six aspirants who were disqualified after screening. One aspirant from Yobe State withdrew from the race after filing his nomination, while 166 others were cleared to contest the shadow poll. The report of the screening panel indicated that Shittu was disqualified for not possessing the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) certificate. The communications minister confirmed that he did not participate in the mandatory youth service because he went straight from the university to the old Oyo State House of Assembly as the youngest elected member in 1979. He claimed that his service in the Assembly is equivalent to national service. No reason was given in last night’s statement by the APC National Working Committee (NWC) for Alhassan’s disqualification. Eleven aspirants were cleared to contest in Taraba State. Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu and Dr. Obafemi Hamzat were cleared to contest. Governors of Niger, Kebbi and Jigawa are unopposed as their opponents were not cleared to contest. Former Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Mallam Nuhu Ribadu, was cleared to challenge Governor Jubrila Bindow for Adamawa State ticket. Also to contest for the ticket is Mahmood Halim Ahmed. Borno State has 21 aspirants, the highest. Zamfara State has nine aspirants for the ticket and Nasarawa has 11. Six aspirants were cleared to run in Ogun State. They are: Jimi Lawal, Dapo Abiodun, Bimbo Abiodun, Adegbenga Kaka, Adekunle Akinlade and Abayomi Hunye.
