The Catholic Artiste and Entertainers Association of Nigeria, CAEAN, has advised that young people be groomed for acting. The group stated this at a recent religious event which held at the St. Agnes Catholic Church, Maryland, Lagos. Six groups partook in the one-week program where  Emmanuel Odoh got the star prize while James Bassey got second position and Shoyemi Tobi David emerged third. Nollywood actor, Emma Ossai, said he loves acting and his passion is to bring in more people into the acting fold. The maiden project was organised by CAEAN. Speaking on the reason for the formation of CAEAN, the spiritual director of the youth of the church, Rev Fr Dominic Onuoha, said that the group was formed to nurture arts in youths. President of CAEAN of St. Agnes Maryland, Mr. Robinson Firwor, who acted in productions like ‘Checkmate’ and ‘Mirror In The Sun’ as a child actor said he is working to revive past programs in the movie sector.
