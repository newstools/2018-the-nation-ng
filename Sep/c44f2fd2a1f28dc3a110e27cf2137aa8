The Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN),  yesterday listed inadequate power supply, high interest rate and frequent tariff increases as some of the factors that militated against the sectors performance in 2017. MAN’s President, Dr. Frank Udemba Jacobs, who stated this at the associations 46th Annual General Meting  in Lagos, said  the challenges are already manifesting in the form of high inventory of unsold finished products. Jacobs said though the government has come up with certain policies, such as the Presidential Enabling Business Environment Council ( PEBEC) aimed at improving the Ease-of- Doing- Business that improved the nation’ s ranking on the World Bank’s index, he insisted that the challenges facing the sector should be addressed frontally, saying this is the only way the sector can be sustained,  especially now that the country is in  the period of intense  political activities. He said the theme of the AGM, ‘Mainstreaming Policies to catalyse industrial Renaissance,’ was borne out of the need to appraise the performance of industrial policy initiatives,  with a view to ensuring that they are positively aligned to the industrial aspirations and overall economic development agenda of the nation. On the African Continental Free Trade Agreement ( AFCFTA), Jacobs said MAN was not against any aggrement that will facilitate intra- African  trade,  particularly where Africans stand to benefit, but pointed out that the group’s resistance borders on the inadequacy of private- sector stakeholders’ consultation  and absence of a credible country -specific study that should form the basis of our negotiation as a country. He said: ” We expressed worry over the haste in the signing of an Agreement upfront without a clue as to what it’s major and defining components would be, or portends for our country- that is, the potential impact of the Agreement on the Nigerian economy”. In his remarks the Director General, Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP), Mamman Ahmadu,  who spoke on  ‘Patronage of made-in-Nigerian-products: Giving effect to Executive order 003,” said BPP is commited to enforcing the Executive Order 003 on Ministries, Departments and Agencies ( MDAs) on patronage of made- in- Nigeria goods to make it easy for the Small & Medium Enterprises (SMEs) to thrive. He praised the agencies and ministries that have complied and warned on implications for non compliance.
