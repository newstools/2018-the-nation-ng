For plunging the people of Oyo town into darkness, the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, has shunned a courtesy by officials of the Association of Nigerian Electricity Distributors. The Association which comprised of officials from Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company [IBEDC] and led by a high chief were in the ancient town for awareness and sensitization of consumers. It was learnt that the royal father decided to shun the visitors to show his displeasure and convey his peopleâ€™s dissatisfaction with the services of the electricity company. The unavailability of power supply has plunged the people of the ancient town into untold hardships, as artisans can no longer work, while businesses are collapsing and life has become unbearable. It was reliably learnt that all efforts by the monarch to seek solution by the management of IBEDC on the situation were to no avail. This prompted the decision by the Alaafin not to accord them any reception when they came visiting. Some members of the Oyo Traditional Council were delegated to address the visitors. The Samu of Oyo, high Chief Lamidi Oyewale Fagbemi, described power failure in the country as a debilitating problem that needs be addressed, adding that the envisioned growth of the economy cannot be achieved without improved electricity supply. He said poor power supply has contributed to the increase of prices of consumer goods and services in the country, thereby affecting the standard of living and thus placing the average citizens in a pitiable condition. He berated the management of the IBEDC for being irresponsive and disrespectful to the plight of the people and their monarch, the Alaafin. In his response, Chief Sunday Oduntan, apologised to the Alaafin and people of the town for hardships the power outage might have caused them.
