Former governor of Kano State, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau has returned to the All Progressives congress (APC) after four years  in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The ex-minister of Education’s decision according to him, became necessary, over what he described as lack of internal democracy in the PDP as well as injustice by the party headquarters to Kano members and its stakeholders. According to his media aide, Sule Yau Sule, who spoke to The Nation on phone, “the defection of lbrahim shekarau to APC is not yet official, but, obviously, there are moves to that. We are going to hold stakeholders meeting that will finally decide the next direction”. The development, he said,was due to the insistence of the national headquarters of the party to dissolve the state executives without recourse to due process and despite a court restraining order. He explained that Shekarau is already consulting with his supporters on the next line of action and the party to move to. “My boss has met Governor Abdullahi Ganduje in Abuja and they have discussed “. However, The Naion learnt that the former minister was contemplating moving to the APC as discussion has almost being concluded. The PDP on Monday had appointed a caretaker committee for Kano state after dissolving the party’s structure last Friday. Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso, a former governor of the state who recently dumped the APC for PDP was said to have ignited the crisis in the state PDP with his insistence to have 51% of the party as he was promised by the party headquarters which the state chapter rejected.
