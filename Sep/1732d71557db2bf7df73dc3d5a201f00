The All Progressives Congress (APC) has cautioned the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, to be mindful of his language and conduct, so as not to tarnish the image of the country abroad. In a statement signed by its Acting National Publicity Secretary, Mr. Yekini Nabena, the party said Prince Secondus is expected to exhibit the highest sense of patriotism, decency and decorum in public conduct and discourse. The satement said: “Regrettably, Prince Uche Secondus has not lived up to these basic expectations. “Weeks ago the PDP National Chairman took the internal matters of the country’s politics to the international scene by writing letters to various international organisations. Again, soon after the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared the Osun State governorship election inconclusive, Prince Secondus without basis accused the electoral body of conspiring with the APC to declare the election inconclusive. “The APC would as a rule ignore irresponsible and baseless utterances and actions as exhibited by the PDP National Chairman, but as we prepare for the forthcoming 2019 general elections, it is necessary we give a word of caution on expected behaviour required of all political sides. Prince Secondus is respectfully advised to temper his political language and conduct.” His unfounded allegation on the inconclusive Osun State governorship election is not expected from such highly-placed party official. Accusing the APC of conspiring with INEC, without proof, is taking mudslinging too far. We advise Prince Secondus not to descend to the level unexpected of his office, less he enters the boxing ring with its attendant mud and dirt. His action will only bring him personal attacks, ridicule. A word is enough for the wise!
