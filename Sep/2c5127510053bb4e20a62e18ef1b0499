Contemporary gospel singer Anu Akinlagun, aka, Anubewaji, has dropped her first single titled, ‘We Believe’. Akinlagun, a worship leader and speaker, said that the four minute song which was produced by Wole Oni, speaks about hope and faith in God and in His capacity to do all that He has spoken. According to her, every believer’s declaration should be ‘I believe, because the scripture says if thou can believe all things are possible’. She added that the inspiration of the song came as a result of her prayer relationship with God. Akinlagun said she intends to use the song to spread the gospel across the length and breadth of the earth, adding that through her music she also intends to be a positive voice to her community and the nation at large. “I enjoin everyone to download the song and let’s spread the gospel together,” she said. “My musical Journey started professionally in 2008. I became one of the lead singers in my church, The Breath of Life Ministry, where I have had the privilege to share the stage with great singers including Panama Parcel Paul and Segun Obe.” She urged upcoming gospel singers to stay true to the vision God gives them, noting that they will be tested and tried. “They should put God first and never neglect the place of prayer. Singing is not just about your talents or gifts but it is about your personal relationship with God.”
