Russian police have broken up protests across the country against a planned increase in the retirement age. Nearly 300 protesters were detained and some beaten with batons, the rights monitoring group OVD-info says. The rallies were called by the jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has capitalised on widespread anger against the reforms. Concessions by President Putin, whose popularity has suffered as a result, have failed to stem the discontent. The protests coincide with elections for 26 heads of Russia’s 85 regions, including in Moscow, which are being held on Sunday. OVD-Info says 291 people were detained in 19 cities. The city of Yekaterinburg in the Urals saw the highest number of arrests – 58 in total, the group said. From 2019, the retirement age for men and women will start being increased gradually. By 2036 it will have risen from 60 to 65 for men and from 55 to 60 for women. Mr Putin softened the initial plan to raise women’s retirement age to 63. Russian men have a life expectancy of 66 while for women it is 77, the World Health Organization says.
