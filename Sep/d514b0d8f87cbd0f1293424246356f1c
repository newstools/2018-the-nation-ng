Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development  Audu Ogbeh has said the government is taking steps to ensure food security for Nigerians. Speaking during the yearly lecture of the Catholic Brothers League in Lagos, Ogbeh explained that guaranteeing food security was a top priority issue for the government. He said the government was working to improve quality and competitiveness of the farm produce, and promoting value chain development. He said, however, the government had recorded great strides in boosting agricultural development in terms of production value and exports. Ogeh said plant varieties and cultivation techniques have been improved to enhance the quality of crops, while   productivity and quality of major products, including rice, have increased. Ogbeh lamented that Nigeria spent $6 million  daily on rice import. Following this, he said the Customs closed the land borders  to encourage Nigerians to eat local rice. The strategy, he observed, is yielding results. He said the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has boosted rice production in Nigeria through its ’s Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP), adding that the efforts made in local production of rice has saved the country about $800 million in foreign exchange.
