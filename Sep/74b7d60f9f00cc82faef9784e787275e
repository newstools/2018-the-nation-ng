Management of the Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma, has confirmed that two of its students died in the shooting that occurred at a bar in Ekpoma town. It said the other three victims were former students of the institution. The university management said the killings was as a result of a quarrel between friends in a Bar and not cult related. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the institution, Mr. Edward Aihevba, said that Police investigations revealed that the incident was not cult-related and was not a jubilation party by graduating students. Aihevba noted that the University Management was embarrassed by the newspapers’ reports that have painted the institution in bad light. He said the institution does not condone wild jubilation and that it is totally safe and devoid of cultism or social indecorum. According to the statement, The University management condemns in totality, the dastardly acts perpetrated by the hoodlums and the senseless killings and we trust that the law enforcement machinery will fish them out to face the full wrath of the law. “It is unfortunate that the casualties include two students of Ambrose Alli University (not graduating) and three ex-student (past graduates). It is necessary to state clearly and unequivocally that cultism does not exist in Ambrose Alli University any more. “We state categorically and emphatically that the incident did not occur within our University and the meeting of friends that ran foul of the law of the land could have taken place anywhere in the world. “We commiserate with the families of the deceased and we pray Almighty God to grant them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.”
