An Igbosere High Court yesterday adjourned till September 12 hearing in an application by nine People’s Democratic Party (PDP) members seeking to nullify the party’s 2017 congresses. Justice Idowu Alakija fixed the date to enable the parties file their applications. The plaintiffs are Ishola Shodiya, Ismaila Abiola, Kehinde Adela Aluminani, Kazeem Adeyemi, Awoyemi Abayomi, Adegboyega Adegbesan, Olalekan Bello, Florence Akojenu and Wasiu Aderounmu. The respondents are PDP National Chairman Uche Secondus, PDP National Vice Chairman South-West, Dr. Eddy Olafeso, Mr Moshood Salvador, and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The plaintiffs are seeking a declaration that the last October 21 local government congresses in Lagos State did not conform with the party’s constitution. They are also praying the court to declare that Salvador and other executive members were not validly elected at the congress, among others. At the resumed hearing of the matter yesterday, the respondents’ counsel, Spurgeon Ataene, said he had filed a preliminary objection and counter-affidavit to the claimants’ suit. He urged the court to strike out the previous one. The claimants’ counsel, O. J. Osinowo, confirmed that he had been served, praying for time to respond. He said since the party’s primary was scheduled for next week, the court should order the parties to maintain the status quo. But Ataene urged the court to discountenance Osinowo’s application. Ataene made an application for an order of accelerated hearing, “so that none of the parties will do what will overreach the decision of the court.” He added: “Should the court be mindful of granting the claimants’ request, there should be no new primary of the party next week, as there is an existing party exco, which came on board by virtue of the Congresses held in October 2017.”
