THE Global aviation industry is interfacing technology, Braking Action Computation Function (BACF), to improve aircraft and runway safety. To achieve this, Airbus and its subsidiary NAVBLUE have developed a new technology to use the aircraft as a sensor to measure and share vital runway braking action data. According to report by the aircraft manufacturer, the new technology will assist prevent Runway Excursions (RE), one of the top three causes of accidents. The report indicates that products such as Airbusâ€™ RaOPS (Runway Overrun Prevention System) are already in service. The system, according to the report, provides real time energy and landing performance monitoring information although an accurate knowledge of runway conditions is just as important for landing performance computations. Airports today use a combination of visual observations and spot-check to assess runway contamination, ground surface friction and braking action reports from pilots although checking the entire width and length of the runway is difficult. Under new rules expected in November 2020, pilots will be required to radio braking action reports to Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) on request.
