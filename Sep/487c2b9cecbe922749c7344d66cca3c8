With glass ceiling and several data showing that only few women are able to make it to the boardroom in Nigeria and globally, stakeholders at the Women In Marketing and Communications Conference/Awards (WIMCA) have urged female marketing and communications professionals to be deliberate in pressing for progress to the highest position of leadership in their careers. The assertion was made at Muson Centre, Lagos where the crème la crème in the marketing and communications industry gathered to celebrate women at the second edition of WIMCA, an initiative of frontline brands and marketing publication, Brand Communicator Magazine with the theme “The Press for Progress.” “This obvious lacuna of women in key positions among other challenges gave birth to WIMCA four years ago. WIMCA was therefore designed to identify the current trends in marketing communications while addressing the career challenges of female marketing executives” Joshua Ajayi, Convener of the event and Publisher of Brand Communicator disclosed. Ayo Oluwatosin, Group Managing Director, Rosabel and Chairman of the occasion, pointed that “the glass ceiling is real but more and more women are breaking through the glass and are making remarkable statements in their various field of human endeavours and Nigeria is not an exception.” Iquo Ukoh, Managing Director, Entod Marketing and one of the keynote Speakers in the session tagged “Engaging Female Consumers in the digital Age” at WIMCA said “Consumers are no longer just king, that are equally Queens” while the digital space offer brands the opportunity to reach their target market. In line with this, Folake Ani-mumuney, Chairperson, FBN Insurance Brokers & President, Advertisers Association of Nigeria (ADVAN) explained that women have to be deliberate in their approach to life and work, part of which is forming a community which support each and encourage each other to rise to the top through mentorship and other support they outline.
