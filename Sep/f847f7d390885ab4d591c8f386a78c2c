For the second time in less than 24 hours, the All Progressives Congress (APC) has again shifted its Presidential primary to Friday, September 28 to avoid a clash with the rerun election in Osun State. The party had on Sunday night announced a shift of the primary earlier scheduled for Tuesday, September 25, 2018 to Thursday, September 27, 2018 apparently to pave the way for President Muhammadu Buhari to be part of the primaries which will be conducted through direct primary. The President who is the sole Presidential aspirant of the party is expected to address the General Assembly of the United Nations on September 25. In a two paragraph statement signed by the Acting National Publicity Secretary said the shift is to allow all registered members across the country to participate in the primary. “In view of the Osun State Governorship rerun election which has been scheduled for Thursday, September 27th, 2018, by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the All Progressives Congress (APC) has now rescheduled the presidential primary election to Friday, September 28th, 2018. “This is to avoid a clash in dates with the Osun State Governorship rerun election and enable all registered Party members in all thirty-six states of the federation, including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) participate in the exercise”
