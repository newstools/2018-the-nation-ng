The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has allayed fears of possible hiccups in petroleum products supply in parts of the country. The move followed an ultimatum issued by the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) to go on strike over purported intervention by an arm of the security agencies in what the union viewed as purely labour matters involving a company and its workers in Delta State. NNPC Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, Mr. Ndu Ughamadu, in a statement yesterday in Abuja, said the corporationâ€™s Group Managing Director, Dr. Maikanti Baru, and his Management team were engaging the parties involved, adding that the parties were close to resolving the issues. Ughamadu advised motorists and other consumers of petroleum products not to engage in panic buying as the NNPC management was close to reaching an amicable resolution of the challenge. NNPC assured that the corporation had adequate storage of petroleum products across the country, advising that they should not entertain any fear of petroleum shortages.
