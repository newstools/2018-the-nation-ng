A Federal High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, has restrained the leaders of the state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), from suspending or expelling ward executive committees of the party at Ifo Constituency 1 Wards 1, 2,3 and 11. In the judgement obtained by The Nation, 10 leaders of the affected wards in Ifo Local Government, instituted the legal action against the party leaders in the state over the alleged plan to expel them(plaintiffs). In the originating summon, the plaintiffs dragged the APC, state chairman, Chief Derin Adebiyi, the Independent National Electoral Commission and the state Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Iliyasu, before the court. The court also warned that INEC, the party leaders and other defendants joined in the suit risk imprisonment if they failed to recognize the plaintiffs as ordered by the court. The plaintiffs had sought the relief from the court to compel the defendants to obey the subsisting judgement, which conferred legitimacy on the ward executive committees in the mentioned wards. Granting the order restraining the defendants, the court ordered the defendants or their proxies to recognise the plaintiffs as the authentic officers of the ward executive committees in wards 1,2,3 and 11 in Ifo 1 state constituency. “An order restraining the defendants by themselves, agents, servants, proxies and surrogates from suspending or expelling the plaintiffs from the first defendant’s political party and recognizing them as the authentic officers of the ward executive committees in wards 1,2,3 and 11 in Ifo 1 state constituency,” the injunction reads in part.
