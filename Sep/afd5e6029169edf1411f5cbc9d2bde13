An aspirant for the Ikom/Boki Federal Constituency seat in Cross River State, Mr. Victor Abang, has promised constituents an effective and robust representation if elected. Abang, popularly called Mature, made the promise at the weekend while declaring his intention to run for the seat. He said he was in the race to win, adding that he had the capacity, strength, connections and contacts to achieve his ambition. “I came into politics years ago to pursue ideas, especially to assist the mankind, provide quality service and bring development to our people. I have kept faith with these ideals. “I had wished to continue to pursue these ideals without holding an elective position. Even when delegations and groups visited and invited me to run for the House of Representatives election, I refused to commit myself, but asked for prayers. “There is enough evidence that the people of Ikom/Boki deserve better representation. As we desire the best, we should send the best hands to represent us well and attract development to our constituency. “After deep reflection and consultation with God, family, friends and political associates, I have decided to offer myself to seek the nomination of All Progressives Congress (APC), to contest the 2019 general election. “I pledge to provide robust representation and add value to the good governance of our people.
