Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue state, has reiterated the need for politicians in the state to eschew violence in the built up to next year’s general elections. He stated this Thursday at St. Vincent De Paul Quasi Parish, Alliade during a funeral mass for the late Nobel Emmanuel Ayargwer. The Governor stated that he would rather lose than win the forthcoming election by violence, noting that it was unnecessary to spill blood for any office because power belonged to God who gives it to whoever he wants. He said the people of the state were resolved on the implementation of the Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Law 2017 stressing that Benue people were not against any group but were against the destruction of their crops by herders, hence the need for ranching. While acknowledging the support of the church to sustain peace in the state, Governor Ortom requested more prayers for continued peace as the 2019 elections approaches. He prayed God to grant the deceased who he said lived a worthy life from the numerous testimonies about him, eternal rest and the bereaved family the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss. Younger brother of the deceased and former state deputy chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Dr. Tsetim Ayargwer, expressed appreciation to Governor Ortom, Knights of St. Johns and political associates for their support in the family’s time of grief. Parish Priest of St. Vincent De Paul Quasi Parish Aliade, Reverend Fr. Alexander Iorhuna, enjoined Christians to be true apostles of Christ by living according to His teachings in order to make heaven after death.
