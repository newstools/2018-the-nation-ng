Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) President Ayuba Wabba has said the National Minimum Wage Committee is yet to submit its report to President Muhammadu Buhari, because it is yet to agree on a figure. He added that the Federal Government had failed to come up with a figure to be agreed on. Comrade Wabba said in an interview in Abuja that while the committee had concluded its deliberation, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr. Chris Ngige, told members that the government needed to consult before coming up with its figure, a position, he noted, negated the earlier agreement to work within its time limit. The minister told reporters in Anambra State that governors were frustrating the committee. But Wabba said 21 states made presentation to the committee with many of them quoting figures, while some said they would abide by whatever decision was arrived at. He said the organised labour had called a meeting of its organs, to inform them of the development, adding that a position would be announced after the meeting, “as the minimum wage is already two years behind the scheduled date.”
