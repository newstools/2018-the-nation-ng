The General Superintendent of The Deeper Life Bible Church, Pastor William Kumuyi, has advised the federal government to look beyond politicians and set up a formidable team that would get Nigeria out of its presence economic challenges. Kumuyi said this yesterday at a youths programme organised by the church at its headquarters in Gbagada, Lagos. The programme, tagged The Gathering of Unstoppable Achievers, brought together thousands of youths from across Lagos and its environs. It featured workshop for students, concert and experience sharing by successful youths who against all odds are walking tall in different sectors of our national life. He said that the federal government must as a matter of urgency set up a strong team of selfless and proficient Nigerians to come together and fashion out ways of addressing Nigeria’s economic challenges. In his address, the Chairman, Centre for Values and Leadership, Prof Pat Utomi, challenged youths to develop their leadership and entrepreneurship qualities as that remains a major panacea for growth and development in Nigeria. He opined that the progress of any leaders comes from entrepreneurship as people make something out of nothing. Utomi said that Nigeria is a critical example  that we are only extracting rent  and we fight ourselves over the money realised from oil and other mineral resources. Utomi noted that the spirit of enterprise and leadership is at the heart of any nation to escape and triumph over misery. Wealth is created out of imagination of people. You must recongnise that to be successful as an entrepreneur in a big way. He stressed that the only thing that will take Nigeria out of its economic challenges is true leadership, saying “l think it is time to realise in Nigeria that we must change course. To have people in political office with low capacity to understand our problem and solve them is really a disservice to our country.
