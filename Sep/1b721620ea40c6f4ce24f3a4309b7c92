An angry mob attacked a former councillor, Sobur Ajetunmobi, for driving his red Toyota Camry to the polling unit 16, ward Osogbo yesterday. But for the quick intervention of security men, he would have been mobbed by the angry voters. They accused him of coming with money in his booth to induce voters. But Ajetunmobi denied the accusation, saying he relocated to a farther distance after the last election and could not have trekked all the way. Normalcy returned after he was forced to move his car away from the area
