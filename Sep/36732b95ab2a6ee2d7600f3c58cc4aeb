Super Eagles Coach, Gernor Rohr will on Saturday in Victoria attempt to return to a winning way after Nigeria’s early exit from the just concluded 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. The Eagles are bottom-placed in their Africa Cup of Nations 2019 qualifying group after losing their first Match to South Africa at home. The German tactician will be parading a squad who were in action for the national team in the 21st FIFA world Cup tournament missing for the  must win AFCON away match on September 8 in Seychelles . With less than 72 hours to the kick of the match, several key players like Shehu Abdullahi, Tyrone Ibuehi, and Captain John Mikel Obi had been ruled out because of injury while Victor Moses had retired from National Team Football week preceding Eagles Camp. Nigeria will also miss the services of three vital players of Alex Iwobi, William Troost-Ekong and Ola Aina as they are not at Seychelles camp after picking up injuries while with their respective clubs. The Seychelles game is a must win for the Super Eagles and the available player would need to step up as another defeat or dropped points in Seychelles could spell doom for the Super Eagles chances of making the 2019 AFCON having already lost at home to South Africa. Rohr will be picking from the array of professional Nigerian internationals already in camp for the fixture as the bubbling camp is swelled with the likes of; Ahmed Musa, Ogenyi Onazi, Odion Ighalo, Etebo Oghenekaro, Leon Balogun, and Jamilu Collins. Others are; Onyekuru, Omeruo, Uzoho, Semi Ajayi, Samuel Kalu, Ndidi, Iheanacho, Awaziem, Nwakali, Bryan Idowu, Simeon Nwankwo, Joel Obi Ikechukwu Ezenwa, abd Daniel Akpeyi. Eagles are two days old at their training camp already. They had a good recovery walk around the beach in front of our Savoy Hotel camp, Victoria Tuesday and also did Foot-Volley game. They were on the turf  for full training time on Wednesday. They also had good cool beach experience to round off the session.
