The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum Resources Downstream, Joseph Iranola Akinlaja, has urged government at all levels as well as stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to urgently invest, resuscitate and develop the abandoned Orile parking space for petroleum tankers to reduce traffic gridlock in Apapa, Orile and Mile 2 corridor of Lagos State. The Federal lawmaker from Ondo State called for social service at this year’s edition of Lagos State Petroleum Marketers Safety Conference   (LSPMSC) at Federal Palace Hotel on Victoria Island, Lagos. Akinlaja said lack of standard parking space in and around Orile-Iganmu, Apapa and Abule-Ado axis, where majority of private tank farms are located, caused the gridlock on Lagos roads. The lawmaker said this had taken a toll on the health of road users, reduced their lifespan and adversely affected their productivity as well as the economy. day, the tankers are back and they will continue to be there. “Until stakeholders, like government, depot owners, among others, come together and resuscitate that Orile tanker park, I don’t see any solution playing out. And if the park must be fixed, it must be in the form of a social service and not an avenue to make money. “If the fees are too much, the tanker divers might not be able to afford it. For example, if they charge them, may be N500, such a fee will be used to maintain, may be the toilets or to provide security or electricity and other services. “Most of the roads to the depots are not accessible to tankers because they are in a bad state. So, any truck going through Apapa Marine Bridge road will be struggling with smaller ones, and this may result in an accident. If our roads are in good condition, many of our trucks would not be damaged.”
