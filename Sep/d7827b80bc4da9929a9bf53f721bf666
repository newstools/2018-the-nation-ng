The governing council of Oke-Ogun Polytechnic, located in Saki area of Oyo State, on Thursday in Ibadan called on academic staff of the institution to resume work immediately or lose their jobs. This is according to a communique jointly signed by its Chairman, Prof. Moshood Tijani; the Secretary and Registrar, Mr A.O Ojewole; and the Chairman, Council Negotiation Committee, Mr Musbau Ayinla. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the communiqué was issued after an emergency meeting of the council held at the conference room of the State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in Ibadan. Recall that the academic staff of the institution embarked on industrial action in conjunction with their counterparts across the state-owned institutions on Aug. 28. The union based their agitation on poor welfare and non-payment of their salary arrears of several months. The governing council, while directing the academic staff of the institution to resume work immediately, said recalcitrant workers should consider losing their jobs. It called on the management to open a central register for academic staff to sign as from Monday, Sept. 10 and said the register should close by 4 p.m. “We empower the management to maintain peace, law and order. “We also stand on our earlier Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the unions which took effect with payment of July 2016 net arrears,” the council said. It also suspended the activities of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) in the institution
