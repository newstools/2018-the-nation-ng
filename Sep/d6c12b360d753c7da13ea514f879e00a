Security detail attached to presidential hopeful Atiku Abubakar yesterday stopped some delegates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from meeting him in Anambra State. Journalists and party members were prevented from having access to Atiku. Some alleged they were beaten up by the aides. Atiku was hosted at the Geogold hotels in Awka by the party executive, led by Chairman Ndibuisi Nwobu. The presidential hopeful, who addressed delegates, urged them not to vote those who will divide the country the more. He said: “I saw the pre-civil war days, the civil war days and the post-civil war days, but we have never seen Nigeria as divided as we have now. I beg of you, it is not about me, but about the future of our children, we must unite to make sure we don’t vote wrongly. “Do you know I have been championing restructuring for years now? It is one thing we must give to every part of this country, to govern and develop themselves. We must not continue to have a country where every state rushes to Abuja to pick up money. We will begin by restructuring, and that will help states to achieve whatever they want to achieve without hindrance. “I promise that as your president, we will build an international airport in the east, not the type they are talking about, but one that is truly international, that would operate flights to other parts of the world. “I urge you to support me so we can develop our regions and reclaim our country again.” Nwobu, promised Atiku that Anambra will support whoever becomes the party’s presidential candidate.
