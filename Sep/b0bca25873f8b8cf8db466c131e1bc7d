Nigerian comedian, Bright Okpocha, popularly known as Basketmouth has again emerged winner of the 2018 edition of the Savanna Pan-African Comic of the Year organised by South African Savanna Comics’ Choice Awards (SCCA). He beat four other African comedians to clinch the coveted title in Johannesburg, South Africa, on Saturday. Announcing the news on his Instagram account, he posted a picture where he held the award plaque and wrote: “Thank you @comicschoice @savannacider for this….I truly appreciate you guys, and to all my peeps that voted for me. You guys rock. #SavannaCCA #Back2Back” Basketmouth, who won the maiden edition of the Savanna Pan-African Comic of the Year award in 2017, has once again been nominated in the same category this year. Before 2017, the annual South African Savanna Comics’ Choice Awards (SCCA) was strictly for South African comedians only. However, last year, it extended one of its categories to other parts of Africa, hence the category is called the Savanna Pan-African Comic of the Year. Meanwhile Basketmouth would be hosting his signature show, ‘Lords of the Ribs’ comedy festival on September 29 and 30, 2018 at the Eko Hotel and Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. The foreign comedians slated to perform that night include Capone, JJ Williams, Kevin J,, Alfred Kaina, Salvador and Mpho Popps. And on the Nigerian corner, it will be likes of Buchi, Okey Bakassi, Igosave, Senator, Funnybone and Dan D Humorous that will thrill the audience.
