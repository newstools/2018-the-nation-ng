League Director, Andrew Isokpehi thanked all the officials and Zonal Coordinators for a job well done in organising a league which has continued to generate positive reviews. “This is a great feat just recorded in Nigerian basketball. All the teams who have qualified for the National Finals have all played an average of 12 games which started from their state qualifiers. “It is an improvement on what we used to have in the past where the five teams will gather in a particular location to play for 4 or 5 days in the name of National Division 2.” He promised an exciting time for all when the teams who have emerged the best out of 61 teams that participated at the zonal level of the Total NBBF Division 2 league converge on Lagos for the finals.
