The Presidential Primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) took place in many wards in Ondo state, but in some wards, it did not hold. Our correspondent, who monitored the exercise in Idanre Local government, noted that party loyalists converged in some wards. The state chairman of the party, Ade Adetimehin described the exercise as successful. Some other party members lauded the exercise. It was however gathered from other councilsâ€™ area that the exercise did not really hold at all.
