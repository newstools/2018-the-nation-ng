Succor is yet to come the way of Chinese Super League side Tiajin Teda as the John Obi Mikel captained side went down 2-0 away to Guangzou R&F at the Yuexiushan Stadium on Saturday. The Super Eagles captain and his Tiajin Teda teammates found their hosts a hard nut to crack conceding the first goal in the 27th minute and the second in the 76th minute. The club has not been able to sing victory song in the last four matches, with the last win dating back to 10th August against Henan Jianye at home. The four last matches have ended in two draws and two defeats including a 5-2 demolition by Beijing Guoan. Ghanaian import Frank Acheampong was in aciton for 73 minutes but found the Guangzou R&F defence difficult to rattle . Tiajin Teda will have to wait till 14th September to see if they will earn three points from visiting Shanghai SIPG. Mikel who will be missing Super Eagles Afcon 2019 qualifier against Seychelles next Saturday in Victoria after pulling out of the tie, has nonetheless expressed optimism that the Eagles will achieve a good result. While Mikel will be missing in action in Victoria, China based Odion Ighalo will be action against the Pirates.Â  Ighalo was on target August 26th as Changchun Yatai avoided home defeat holding Hebei CFFC to a 2-2 draw. Super Eagles Coach Gernot Rohr believes Victoria tie will afford Ighalo ample opportunity to rediscover his scoring skills for the team.
