BEFORE a massive crowd of party supporters, a former Speaker of the Osun State House of Assembly, Mr. Adejare Bello yesterday in his Ede hometown formally defected from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). His defection was the highlight of the APC campaign in the town ahead of next weekend’s governorship election in the state. Bello said the decision to leave PDP for APC was taken in the interest of Ede and its people as the development of the town remains paramount. The APC flagbearer in the election, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, promised to prioritize the welfare of the people particularly Ede residents. The erstwhile Speaker announced his defection at the APC Mega Rally held at Adventist Government High School, Ede. Bello dismissed reports that he was financially induced to defect to the ruling party. “It is unfortunate that series of lies have been concocted to discredit my humble self as regards my decision to leave PDP for APC,” he said. “But to set the records straight, it is imperative to tell my people particularly Ede indigenes that all these lies were concocted to incite the public against me because I am known for development of Osun particularly Ede. “To my supporters in Ede and the entire Osun State, I want you all to see my defection as the beginning of total liberation from the shackles of retrogression and backwardness. “This is the time to fight and liberate our land from the hands of those who believe no one can do more than them. “This is a collective task, if we truly love our town no effort must be spared at giving due support to APC and its governorship candidate, Oyetola. “As a student of history, the Adeleke’s political dynasty in Ede has overstayed, it is long overdue and this is the right time for us as lovers and good ambassadors of Ede to take our future in our hands and reposition our town for greater development. “To my supporters, I can assure you that the new era has just begun, this is a new down in the political history of our town and our dear state as this will usher-in all round growth, development and transformation. “Nobody loves Ede than I do and I swear to God that I am defecting to APC to bring all round development to Ede �as you all know my avowed love, passion and commitment for the advancement of this town right from onset.” Addressing the crowd, Governor rauf Aregbesola said he has awarded contract for the construction of Akoda-Ede / Ejigbo road. He described Adejare Bello as a core Omoluabi and virtuous person who has distinguished himself in all strata of life. Aregbesola implored the people of the state to vote for continuity, saying Oyetola remains the only person that can consolidate on his good legacies. Earlier, the APC governorship candidate, Gboyega Oyetola promised to build on the template of good governance that Aregbesola’s administration had laid.
