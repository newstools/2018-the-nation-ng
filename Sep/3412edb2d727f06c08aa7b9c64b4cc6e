GOING by a statement credited yesterday to Transportation Minister Rotimi Amaechi, the crisis rocking the Rivers State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may not be over yet. The minister and leader of the APC in the Southsouth state has disowned Senator Magnus Abe, who is jostling for the party’s governorship ticket. Last week, Abe acknowledged Amaechi as his leader. But the minister said the senator’s actions were targeted at weakening and destroying the party. Amaechi, in a statement in Abuja by his media office, said Abe cannot refer to him (Amaechi) as a leader when he publicly insults him, his wife and others.
