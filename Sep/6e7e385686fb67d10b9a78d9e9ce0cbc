He appealed to governor, Akeredolu to consider Ojogo option’ as he jostled for a position at the lower chamber. According to him,”We are urging Ojogo, to push for the House of Reps seat for Ilaje Ese-Odo Federal Constituency because of his pedigree. “We have observed with keen interest, the dynamics of the race as it has attracted numerous aspirants. While conceding to all such aspirants their right to aspire, including the House of Representatives seat, it has become very timely that we give our support to one of own. “Ilaje Justice Coalition is of the opinion that Apois having done eight years from 2007-2011 and Ilaje on the verge of competing their eight years from 2011 till date, it is only natural that the Arogbo axis of the Federal constituency produces the next occupier of the seat. Justice and fairness are our watchword. “It is only when we have this clear understanding and sense of justice that there can be a better society devoid of needless suspicion and marginalisation. This indeed, is a new approach to our age-long desire of unity and love in the federal constituency.“
