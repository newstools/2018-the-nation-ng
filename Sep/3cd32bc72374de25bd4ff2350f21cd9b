MUSIC critic Osagie Alonge who recently slammed singer Teniola Apata for her looks on an episode of his podcast called ‘Loose Talk’ has come under verbal attacks from Nigerians. Osagie who is popularly known as Osagz had said that Teniola would not make it in the music industry and would be better off in the entertainment industry as a songwriter rather than a singer because “she doesn’t have the looks.” Osagz’s comment did not go unnoticed by Nigerians who took to social media to slam him for his biased opinion with their comments. Hushpuppi reacted by quoting Adele “Music is for the Ears not the eyes” @tenientertainer.  Osgaz was also asked to take back his offensive comment as references were made to talented musicians like Sia, Queen Latifah and Missy Elliot. Oher successful plus-sized entertainers include Eniola Badmus, Lepacious Bose and Wunmi Obe. Though Osagz has apologised to Teniola on his Instagram page, claiming that his statement was taken out of context and only have her best interest at heart, fans maintained that degrading entertainers based on looks instead of talents should stop. The plus-sized singer and song writer Teniola Apata, popularly known as Teni entertainer is considered to be a tomboy who prefers the African style and has won several awards especially for her “fargin” song.
