Social Democratic Party yesterday held its mega rally in Osogbo, Osun State capital, to rally support for its candidate in the September 22 governorship election, Senator Iyiola Omisore. Led by the national leader of the party, Chief Olu Falae, who was former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, the SDP said it was well positioned to win the forthcoming poll. Falae spoke on restructuring of Nigeria, which he said was  over due, maintaining that “until something is done in that direction, peace and development cannot be guaranteed in Nigeria. He said restructuring of the country could only be realized under the SDP-led government. On the candidature of Omisore, Falae said: “Our candidate remains the best among all other contestants in the race and with Omisore in government, Osun will get out of pains occasioned by mis-governance.” Addressing his supporters at the Nelson Mandela Freedom Park, the venue of the rally, the SDP flag bearer accused the Aregbesola administration of owing workers and pensioners their salaries and pensions. Omisore said Aregbesola should first “go and pay” workers salaries before fielding a candidate for the September 22 governorship election. He wondered why a government could owe workers’ salaries when it has money to fund political campaigns and rallies, alleging that the APC had spent over N5 billion on campaign bill boards. Assuring workers of paying the backlog of their salaries arrears on assumption of office, he promised total overhauling of the Education, Health and Agricultural and other sectors. Omisore also accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of working hand in hand to perpetrate electoral fraud before, during and after the conduct of the election.
