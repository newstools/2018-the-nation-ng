The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), yesterday dismissed as untrue reports that it had  suspended some high ranking members of the party ahead of tomorrows governorship primary.

However,the state publicity secretary of the party,Mr.Joe Igbokwe described  the report as “a lie from the pit of hell, an ugly story planted by ugly persons to cause disaffection in the land of limitless opportunities and the pride of the nation.” He added: “this is an election period and politicians are trying to upstage one another by resorting to playing to the gallery by manufacturing lies, innuendoes and outright subterfuge to gain advantage.  This is not the culture of Lagos APC and it can never be. “Let it be known and it is hereby made known that APC Lagos cannot accept this brigandage, political irresponsibility and rascality.  Those who are parading the this fake news are enemies of our great party,  they do not mean well and therefore cannot succeed.”
