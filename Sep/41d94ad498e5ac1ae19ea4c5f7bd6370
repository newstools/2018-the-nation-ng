ECOWAS yesterday called for the effective implementation of security protocols to achieve sustainable peace and progress in the sub-region. Col. Pale Ollo Alain, head of Peace Support Operations Division, spoke in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) to mark the International Day of Peace in Abuja. International Day of Peace is observed September 21, every year to strengthen ideals of peace. The theme for the 2018 celebration is “Right to Peace – the Universal Declaration of Human Rights at 70’’. Alain said the call became imperative following the need to tackle cross-border threats, farmers-herders clashes, religious and ethnic conflicts in the sub-region. “To have sustainable peace, we must embrace dialogue, mutual cooperation and understanding, because no religion encourages violence. “None of the religions encourages violence but from religious issues, you will see violence. “Internationally, we have many measures that can help to avoid these violent activities; we have anti-terrorist strategy, Sahel strategy, but it is the implementation from our member-states that is lacking.
