Members of the Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PTECSSAN), yesterday,  picketed Nokia Solutions Networks over alleged flawed redundancy exercise and disregard for local  industrial laws. The group alleged that the anti-labour practises of the firm was further exacerbated by its casualisation of workers while staff are disengaged and outsourced to recruitment firms and given three months employment letters. Its President, Oladapo Moses said the group was not against the redundancy laws of the company as  it was designed   to cut cost. He however wondered why expatriates that have continued to abuse local industrial laws were still retained in the firm. He said: “ It is appalling that an expatriate is a fleet manager, an expatriate is a chief security officer (CSO) and those that have spent more than 10 years in the country in disregard to the laws of the land are left in employment while Nigerians were sacked. “We went to the Ministry of Labour which said the firm should hold on but the new Human Resources Manager (HRM) boasted that he could do anything and get away with it. This made him to further disengage13 workers last Friday in total disobedience of the Federal Government.”
