The traditional ruler of Issele-Uku Kingdom of Delta State, Agbogidi Obi Nduka, has pledged to work towards making the Ine Aho Festival, which kicks off on September 15, a tourist attraction. The monarch said this could be achieved through the promotion of the kingdom’s native Akwa Ocha, food, language, morals and hospitality. He spoke at the Oligbo Royal Palace in Delta to announce the traditional activities marking the annual event. The Obi said: “The glory of Issele-Uku lies in its unfettered adherence to its rich culture and traditions. One of the imperative cultures of Issele-Uku is the Ine Aho Festival, which is the most revered festival in the ancient town of Issele-Uku. “Ine Aho Festival, (now christened Ine Onyimi) has been celebrated over the years by our people yearly, mostly from the month of August through September to October. The significance of the Ine Aho Festival to the people of Issele-Uku is numerous”. According to him, there were a number of festivals in Issele-Uku that could be leveraged to attract investment to the town. He said the “Izu Afiachi” which is marked every year to honour Queen Omu, the progenitor of the Omu dynasty in Oligbo Kingdom, was one. Others included the practice of the monarch going into seclusion (Iba Nzu), five days to the “Ine Aho Festival”, which is a period of spiritual cleansing and purification of the town from evil. He added: “During the period of ‘Iba Nzu’, the people in the town would be refrained from noisemaking and all forms of noise are prohibited. Vigils are observed in this period at the palace. Our ancestors during this time are appeased by the prayers offered by the Obi, who remains isolated and abstains from movements. Friends, well-wishers as well as visitors are given Nzu (white chalk) to rob on their bodies. It is believed that by so doing it cleanses them of evil.”
