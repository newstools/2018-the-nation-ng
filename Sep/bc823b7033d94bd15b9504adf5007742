Labour unions in Ekiti State have directed workers in both public and private sectors to stay at home from Wednesday to press home for a new minimum wage. The state councils of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) and Trade Union Congress (TUC) said on Tuesday that the strike will be total. The state NLC Chairman, Raymond Adesanmi and his TUC counterpart, Odunayo Adesoye, said the directive affects government workers, including commercial drivers, Okada operators, banks, market men and women should stay off businesses. The TUC boss, who spoke on behalf of the labour leaders, said the strike action will be total in Ekiti, saying the body had already entered into agreement with Civil Society Organisations to ensure its success. He said the leaderships of the labour centers in Ekiti had agreed to work together and ensure the success of the nationwide strike, which begins 12 midnight on Tuesday. Adesoye said:“The strike action in Ekiti commencing from tomorrow will be total. It is going to be a total paralysis, because both public and private sectors will be affected. “The banks, commercial drivers, Okada operators and sole business owners will participate in this strike. We have reached out to the Civil Society Organisations to ensure will mobilize for the strike. “We are not going to shy away from picketing areas that fail to conform with our directive as given from Abuja.”
