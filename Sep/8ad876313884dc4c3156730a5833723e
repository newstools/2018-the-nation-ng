A student, Ogechukwu Okafor, who allegedly smashed the windscreens and windows of a commercial bus following the driver’s refusal to pay an illegal N200 parking fee, was on Thursday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Okafor, 21, of Awolowo Way, Ikeja, Lagos, was arraigned on a two-count charge of conspiracy and wilful damage before Mrs F.F George. Prosecuting Sergeant Godwin Awase alleged that Okafor and an unnamed accomplice committed the offence on August 30 at Alade Close, Ikeja. Awase said they destroyed the front, back windscreens and all the side windows of a vehicle belonging to Mr Stanley Ajiboye because of his failure to give the defendant N200 for parking on their street. Awase said: “When the complainant parked his bus on the street, the defendant approached him and demanded for N200 as parking fee. The complainant refused to give him and drove out of the street to the express road. “But the defendant followed him and insisted on collecting the money. He tried to deflate the bus’ tyres but the complainant prevented him following which a scuffle broke out. “The complainant was beaten, his vehicle damaged and his phone stolen.” The court heard that the police were invited and they arrested the defendant, while his accomplice escaped. According to the prosecutor, the value of the property stolen and destroyed was N113, 000. The offences contravened Sections 350 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015, Awase added.
Okafir pleaded not guilty. Magistrate George granted him N50, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum and adjourned till September 27.
