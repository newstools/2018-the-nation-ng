To harness the potentials of water transportation so as to ease traffic congestion on Lagos roads, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode on Thursday commissioned an ultra-modern Ferry Terminal and a Multi-level Car Park as well as the headquarters of the Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) in the Falomo area of Ikoyi. The unveiling of the edifice which was delivered through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement with MTN Nigeria, the governor said, was for the overall benefit of residents and signposts the readiness, willingness and ability of the state government to take full and effective control of its waterways. Ambode was represented at the ceremony by the stateâ€™s Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Adeniji Kazeem. He said completion of the project, which started seven years ago, was an eloquent demonstration of the appreciation and recognition of the efforts of the state government toward the overall development of water transport sector in the State.
