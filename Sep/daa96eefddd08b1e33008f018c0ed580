Retired Lt. General Jeremiah Timbut Useni has said he will restructure Plateau State and end insecurity if elected governor of the state in the coming general election. Useni was speaking in Abuja after he submitted his expression of interest and nomination form, at the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) National Secretariat, Wadata House, Abuja. The battle for the number one seat in Plateau has begun with candidates submitting their nomination forms preparing them for the contest ahead. Useni who is also a former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory Abuja, is promising to provide free education, boost Agriculture and attract foreign investors in the State. For now, about 16 aspirants of the PDP have collected nomination forms for the party’s governorship ticket. They have however called on the party’s leadership to ensure credible governorship primaries. If nominated, Jeremiah Useni may be facing Governor Simon Lalong who is for now the only aspirant seeking re-election under the All Progressives Congress (APC).
