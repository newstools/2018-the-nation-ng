Former Acting Managing Director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) Pastor Power Aginighan is dead. Aginighan, a chieftain of the Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and leader of the Ijaw elements within the party, reportedly lost his life in a ghastly road accident around the Mbiama end of the East-West Expressway last Friday. He died in the crash with his son Tammy and his police escort, whose name could not be confirmed at the time of filing this report. Our correspondent gathered the vehicle conveying the deceased was crushed by a trailer, leading to an inferno, which burnt the victims beyond recognition. Confirming the sad news, the state treasurer of the APC, Ebiakpo Ezebiri, said the incident happened on Friday, adding leaders of the party had been trying to reach the deceased all through the day but he was unreachable. “We were together on Thursday when we hosted Professor Pat Utomi. People were trying to reach him yesterday to get his attention on some matters but he was unreachable. “Nobody knew he was dead. The accident happened during the day but since they had been burnt beyond recognition, nobody could have known who was involved. “He was in the vehicle with his son and his police escort when the accident happened just after the Mbiama bridge. “Some of our people have already gone to the scene of the accident to retrieve the bodies. We are in mourning, this is very painful,” Ezebiri said. It would be recalled the Ijaw elements of the APC, just over a week ago, conferred the leadership of their stock in the party on Aginighan. He played host to governorship aspirant, Professor Pat Utomi, who consulted the Delta APC Ijaws just a few days ago. The state command’s spokesman, DSP Andrew Aniamaka, couldn’t confirm the incident. He however promised to link up with the Bayelsa State command for feelers.
