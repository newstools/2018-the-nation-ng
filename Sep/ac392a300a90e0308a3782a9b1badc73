These are in line with the broad objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the global Strategic Initiatives of SOS Children’s Villages International. Shedding light on the partnership, Erhumwunse said: “By partnering with Radisson Blu Hotel, SOS Children’s Villages Nigeria is fulfilling her key mandate of providing quality care to children who are at risk or who may have lost one or both parents and further helping to empower and improve the lives of young people in Nigeria. “The partnership is coming on the heels of similar moves by SOS Children’s Villages globally, as part of the YouthCan! Campaign which we launched in Nigeria in 2017″. Explaining Radisson Blu’s decision for the deal, Balassis said: “We are glad to be part of this partnership with SOS Children’s Villages Nigeria enabling us to reach out and provide better future for vulnerable children”.
