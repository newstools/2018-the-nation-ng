Industrialists at the Yaba Industrial Estate, Sabo have called for the quick resolution of their relocation case, saying that will help them focus on contributing their quota to the economic development of the country. They said prolonging the case will be of no benefit to any party as it will go against the increase in local production capacity being championed by the federal government. The tenants have been at loggerheads with the Lagos state government through its investment arm, Ibile holdings, that wants to move them to another location from Yaba to Ikorodu which they said negates the previous agreement they had with the state government. They are presently at the Igbosere High Court where they filed an interlocutory injunction restraining Ibile holidings and the state government from forcefully ejecting them before the matter must have been heard. Mrs Alaba Bamgbose, one of the industrialists in the estate said they want speedy resolution of the matter as it has brought an air of uncertainty to the area. She added that the obvious delay being brought to the case by the counsel of Ibile holdings in challenging the jurisdiction of the court to hear the matter should be looked into for their benefits. She said they are hoping the court grant their wish in stopping the authorities from throwing them out of the estate where they havenâ€™t defaulted in payment to the government since the establishment of the place as the first industrial estate in Nigeria.
