PRESIDENTIAL aspirants of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) may have resolved to back whoever clinched the  ticket amongst them at party’s National Convention slated for Port Harcourt, Rivers State, one of the aspirants, Attahiru Bafarawa, has said. The former Sokoto governor said the aspirants were resolute in their resolve to unseat the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration. He spoke in Bauchi. He told reporters yesterday: “Two aspirants come from Sokoto my home state, the present Governor, Aminu Tambuwal and me, Attahiru Bafarawa. “That is not a problem at all because we the aspirants pledged that whoever emerged the candidate, we will all support him as our presidential candidate.” Bafarawa said what the aspirants wanted was to “rescue Nigeria from All Progressives Congress (APC). “I am a democrat and therefore ready to support any aspirant who emerges as the party’s flag-bearer in order to move the country forward. “We all, however, need to be screened before the final decision on the party’s candidate is taken. I am not into politics to make money but to serve and I remain the best among the aspirants with 8 years’ experience as Governor of Sokoto State.”
