Former Golden Eaglets striker, Victor Osimhen has revealed to NationSport that his blossoming form with Belgium side, Sporting Charleroi is down to the experience gathered from the parent club, Wolfsburg. The 19-year-old moved to the German Bundesliga in the summer of the 2016/17 season after he helped Nigeria conquer the world in 2015 at Under-17 level and emerged top scorer with ten goals and two assists. However, he hasn’t hit the heights expected at club level due to injuries and was forced to seek a loan move to Charleroi where he reminded everyone of his abilities with an audacious back kneel goal during his side’s 1-1 draw against Waasland-Beveren at the weekend. Speaking exclusively to NationSport from his new base in Belgium, he said: “I feel great. I feel so overwhelmed. I feel really happy to be here – to get myself back on track. I’m really happy. The people here are nice and the Coach really believes in me.
