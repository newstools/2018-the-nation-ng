The Enugu Electricity Distribution Company has appealed to landlords, caretakers and agents of property to ensure that their out-going tenants clear all electricity bills before leaving the house. EEDC Head of Communication Mr Emeka Ezeh made the appeal while speaking with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu yesterday. Ezeh noted that the appeal became necessary as some tenants had made it a habit to pass the bulk of their unpaid bills to new, unsuspecting tenants to settle. He also called on in-coming tenants to ensure that the new apartment or property they were moving into “is not  indebted to the company.” “Tenants moving into new property should ensure they are duly registered and not indebted to EEDC. “This is to avoid inheriting unpaid electricity bills and being disconnected as a result. “Landlords are to ensure tenants clear accumulated electricity bills before vacating their property to avoid passing unpaid bills to incoming tenants,’’ he said. According to him, members of the public can make further enquire about settlement of bills by calling 084700100 or log in www.enugudisco.com.
