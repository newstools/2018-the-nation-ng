One person, a boy is said to have died from a stray bullet following a clash between members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN) and security personnel in the commercial city of Potiskum, Yobe State. Three members of the IMN have also been reportedly injured during the clash which took place around 8.30am Friday. Yobe State Commissioner of Police (CP) Mr. Sumonu Abdulmalik confirmed the incident to our correspondent. According to the CP, “the problem started when El-Zazzaky people during their yearly Ashura procession attempted to seize a gun from a soldier. Three people were wounded from the fracas. This I can confirm to you but I am still expecting details later in the day”. But one of the members of the group, Ibraheem El Tafseer denied the CP’s claim, saying that, “that is not our habit, that is not in our character. What the CP told you is not true”. “We have spent more than 25 years doing our Ashura procession in Potiskum. But today we came on the street and we were going then soldier came and started beating our members and later opened fire on them. Three people were injured. One person was hit by a stray bullet. Unfortunately he died.  But he is not our member. They arrested one of us and took him away. “The claim of the police is not true. We have even finished the procession and we gathered to round up when they now came. Nobody tried to attack them. That is not our habit.  That is not in our character,” Ibraheem narrated. Another source said that the members of the IMN threw stones at the JTF Vehicle which provoked the security personnel. Meanwhile, the sound of gunshots threw the commercial city into pandemonium. But the commissioner of police has informed that normalcy has returned to the city.
