Nestle Nigeria Plc has rewarded consumers with  N15 million in its ‘NESCAFE get started’ promotion. Three lucky consumers won N1million, while others won in the categories of N500, 00 0, N250, 000 and consolation prizes of N100, 000. One of the winners, an Abuja-based trader, Mrs. Olabisi Arogundade, said her daughter used her phone to enter for the promo, which eventually got her the highest prize of N1million. Also, winning N1million was Olawole Matthew, a medical student of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, who said he takes the product when studying for exams. “It keeps me awake and refreshes and energizes my memory,” he said. Speaking during the prize presentation at the Nestle Plc’s Ilupeju Office, Lagos, Brand Manager for NESCAFE, Omofasa Orhiunu, said the promotion was designed to reward loyal consumers who have over the years patronised the brand to keep its leadership position in the market. He said though people could be sceptical of the genuineness of promotions of this kind, the presentation would put paid to such doubts. ”You know as Nigerians we are very sceptical about things like this, when you call a consumer and say you have won N1million, the consumer receives the message with doubt. Consumers do not really believe in promos, but this will definitely change their perception about promotions,” he said.
