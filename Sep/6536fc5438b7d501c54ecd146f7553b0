The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) yesterday denied deliberately throwing some residents of Ilasamaja in Mushin Local Government Area of Lagos State into darkness to force them to pay their bills. In a statement, the firm described as false the residents’ claim that the blackout was ploy to get them to pay what they called “outrageous bills.” The Igbehin Adun, Ifetedo, Ishokan and Ifesowapo communities on Monday said their lights were cut because of their refusal to pay the bills. EKEDC’s Corporate Communications General Manager Godwin Idemudia explained that the power outage was originally caused by a faulty 11kv feeder in Ilasamaja that tripped on August 24. The company, he said, made efforts to restore light but the residents refused the technical crew access to the faulty feeder. He said efforts made to dialogue with the community’s representatives to resolve the issue proved abortive.  Rather than embrace peace, they filed a petition against the power distribution company at the Area D Command Police Station in Mushin, he said. “The company has made efforts to restore electricity to the areas, having identified the problem, but was restricted by members of the communities. “Some members of the communities refused our technical crew access to rectify the faults; this was why the company withdrew its workers for safety. “We have appealed to members of the affected areas, especially in Ilasamaja, Mushin Local Government Area, to embrace dialogue in settling the dispute, but rather they preferred violence. “Such violent act has made the company’s management to withdraw its workers from the area for their safety,” he said. The bills, Idemudia said, had an average of 15 hours power supply daily before the incident, adding that the company would never intentionally put customers in darkness.
