Two serving Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senators have vowed to sack the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai from office in the 2019 governorship election in the state. Senators Suleiman Hunkuyi (Kaduna North) and Danjuma La’ah (Kaduna South) said they have joined forces against the governor to defeat him at the poll. While Hunkuyi is contesting the position on the platform of the PDP, La’ah said he was mobilizing voters in his senatorial district for his colleague to unseat El-Rufai of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Addressing a gathering at the rally, Hunkuyi promised that if elected, he would, within one week, reinstate all the traditional rulers and chiefs that were sacked by the governor earlier this year, describing their removal was an act of injustice. The aspirant also promised to revisit the case of the over 25, 000 primary school teachers who were sacked by the governor. Hunkuyi said he would set up a committee that would review the cases of the affected teachers strictly on their merits. He accused the state government of impoverishing the people through harsh social and economic policies, adding that the governor has plunged the state into huge debts for coming generations to grapple with. Hunkuyi, who dumped the APC for the PDP in July, expressed regrets that El-Rufai could turn against him after providing the political structure that enabled him win the seat in 2015. The federal lawmaker further said El-Rufai cannot pretend to be unaware that the people of Kaduna State have rejected him, owing to what he described as the governor’s anti people policies. El-Rufai and Hunkuyi used to be in the same political camp in the APC. They were however torn apart by disagreement arising from differences in opinion and conflict of interests. They disagreements got to a baking point in May this year, when the governor demolished the senator’s property in Kaduna.
