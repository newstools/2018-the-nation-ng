The Southwest zone of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has accused the management of Lagos State University (LASU) of impunity in witch-hunting leaders of the institution’s chapter of the union. Three ASUU leaders in LASU have been queried by the university, following a letter they wrote to the Governing Council requesting an investigation into the backdating of Vice Chancellor Prof. Lanre Fagbohun’s promotion to the professorship cadre. Coordinator of ASUU Akure zone Dr. Alex Odigi said yesterday during a congress at LASU that the university violated its laws by questioning the union leaders. He said: “We want the public to know that charges have been brought up against three executives. “They are Dr. Tony Dansu, secretary; Dr. Adeolu Oyekan, assistant secretary and Dr. Kemi Abodunrin Shonibare, treasurer. “It is not news to us that the university sometime ago unjustly dismissed our colleagues, the chairperson and the vice chairperson of our branch. “They have begun another systematic process in which they intend to also dismiss the secretary, assistant secretary and treasurer, under the cover of the trump up charge of having collected a classified document and released or publicly issued out. I don’t know where they are making their own rules from. There are some things that if they want to do, they have to look at the law of the states and federation before they can embark on it.”
