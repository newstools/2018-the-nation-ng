A front-runner for the NFF presidency Aminu Maigari has described as “unacceptable” the decision of the electoral committee to issue him “provisional clearance” after they had earlier cleared him for the polls. “The decision of the electoral committee is unacceptable after I was cleared to run for this elections. I believe that there is a deadline for the hearing of petitions, not just a few hours to the elections,” the former NFF boss told SCORENigeria. He further said he will appeal the decision of the electoral committee. Maigari also said the original copies of his school certificates are intact and are readily available for any examination. “I have my original certificates fully supported by all the necessary documentation and they are available for anyone who cares to examine them,” he maintained.
