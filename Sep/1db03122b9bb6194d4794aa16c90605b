Stakeholders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the northern senatorial district of Cross River State, have insisted that in line with the zoning formula of the party, the 2019 governorship ticket must remain in the district. The resolution was contained in a five point communiqué issued at the end of the northern APC stakeholders meeting held in Ogoja Local Government Area. The APC leaders argued that the governorship ticket of the party is still domiciled in the north as the party is operating an eight-year zoning formula, which has been used to fill positions from national to ward levels. “The Cross River North All Progressive Congress (APC) acknowledges that, the APC is a fair and just party. That, they acknowledge that there is an existing zoning structure within the nation, state and other components of the country that has led to the relative growth and success of the APC in the state and the country, generally. “That, the Cross River North All Progressive Congress (APC) expresses faith in the collective existence of various components of the state in the light of justice, fairness and equity. “That, Cross River State, being a component of this stability and growth of the party, the Cross River North All Progressives Congress (APC) expects and anticipates that other parts of the state should respect the existing zoning template.”
