A train yesterday killed a motorcyclist and his passenger at the railway level crossing at PWD near Ikeja GRA. The identity card of Police Inspector Philip Kolo was found at the accident scene. It could not be ascertained if he was the rider or the passenger. Lagos District Manager of Nigeria Railway Corporation (NRC) Jerry Oche said  the motorcyclist refused to stop for the Apapa-bound train. “We have warned passersby, motorists and other road users to stay away from railway tracks. “Railway track is a very dangerous place to toy with; everything involves iron, both the rail tracks and the train itself. “I learnt that he was trying to outsmart the train before he was crushed by the moving train. “It’s an unfortunate accident. “We appeal to people to learn from such accident and be patient at the railway level crossings across the state,” he said. The district manager said the victims’ remains had been taken to the mortuary, adding that the police were working on contacting their families.
