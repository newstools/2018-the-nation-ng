Five-time Ballon d’Or winner and Portugal international Cristiano Ronaldo, will be left permanently on the bench if Croatian coach Zlatko Dalic were to be in charge of his club. A very angry Dalic bared his mind after Ronaldo failed to attend the UEFA award Thursday where former teammate Luka Modric emerged best player of the year. Dalic who led Croatia to second place finish in Russia described Ronaldo who recently moved to Juventus from Real Madrid as a an “egoist” “Ronaldo not attending UEFA ceremony and those comments about Luka winning it… it is not worthy of my comment,” he told Sportske Novosti before providing exactly that. “It only proves what I keep saying: Ronaldo is egoist and I’d never want him in my team. “He is kind of player that only thinks, ‘No matter if we lose, the only thing that matters is that I score a goal!'” Dalic’s words are interestingly timed given Croatia travel to Portugal for a friendly next week but the 51-year-old seemingly has little appetite for a grudge match. “Our main goal is Euro 2020, so Portugal and UEFA Nation’s League is not that important and even to lose against Portugal and Spain is no big deal,” he said. “I am not saying we will not try to win, but I don’t want to put too much pressure on our team when Euro 2020 is the next big thing that counts. “The team is worn out and needs fresh energy, strength and motivation.” Croatia will begin their post-World Cup campaign without Mario Mandzukic, Vedran Corluka and Danijel Subasic – all of whom retired from international football after the tournament.
