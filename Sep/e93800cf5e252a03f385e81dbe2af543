Germany will host the 2024 European championship, otherwise known as Euro 2024, after beating Turkey to the right, in Nyon on Thursday. The Berlin Olympic Stadium will host the final of the 24-team tournament, with 51 games scheduled for up to 32 days in June and July 2024. Other cities that will be used for the competition are Cologne, Dortmund, Düsseldorf, Frankfurt, Gelsenkirchen, Hamburg, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart. This means that the 2006 FIFA World Cup hosts will stage the European Championship for the first time as a unified country, with West Germany having hosted the 1988 tournament. This is Turkey’s fourth defeat in the past five Euro bidding races. The country had hoped to mark the republic’s 100th anniversary in 2024 by staging its first major international football tournament, haven lost the opportunity to host the Euros in 2008, 2012 and 2016, as well as the the 2020 Summer Olympics Euro 2024 will return to a single-host format after Euro 2020 is held across Europe, including Germany. In another development, UEFA announced it would begin using video assistant referees(VAR) in the 2019/2020 Champions League, after a debut in the Super Cup. It also approved the use of VAR for the 2020 European Championship and the 2020/21 Europa League.
