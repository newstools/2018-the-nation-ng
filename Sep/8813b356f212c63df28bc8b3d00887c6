The tin-city of Jos came alive last weekend as Legend Extra Stout hosted thousands of fans courtesy of its flagship consumer engagement platform, the Real Deal Experience. Thousands of fans turned up for the exciting show which held at The Polo Field. Headlining the show was popular rap-star M.I, who delivered a thrilling performance. From the moment he mounted the stage, a deafening applause greeted him and grew louder as he grabbed the mic and sang from his popular hits. M.I, known for his energetic stage performance left the crowd asking for more. Most of them did not want his session to end. With the show being hosted by Ifu Ennada and comedian DeDon, the audience did not have a boring moment throughout the night. And in keeping with its traditional legendary taste, a ‘tell and win’ competition was held. The competition is a blind taste test in which participants were made to tell the difference between the taste of Legend Extra Stout and other stout brands. Lucky winners of the competition went home with prizes. The Real Deal Experience is known for its intense musical performances, hilarious stand-up comedy, funny and poetic eulogies. And prior to the show, the brand’s Portfolio Manager, Mainstreet Lager, and Stout brands, Emmanuel Agu, assured that the show was raising the bars with the Jos edition. “I am happy that another Real Deal Experience has hit the city of Jos and it is another promise delivered to the customers and lovers of entertainment are brought closer to their idols,” said Agu. Since its inception, the Legend Extra Stout Real Deal Experience Show has delighted fans in several Nigerian cities including Aba, Ibadan, Onitsha, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Abakaliki, Owerri, Umuahia, Enugu and Lagos.  The show has over the years featured some of Nigeria’s A-list artistes including Harrysong, Timaya, Kcee, 9ice, Oritsefemi, Small Doctor, Mr. Raw, and The Obiligbo Brothers
