Legislators have been advised to make laws that would protect and develop the youth as one of their major roles in ensuring a better society. The Lagos State House of Assembly aspirant vying to represent Somolu Constituency ll, on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Tunde Aleshinloye-Williams, gave this advice in Lagos while addressing some party members. Aleshinloye-Williams who stated that the youth are the backbone of any Nation added: “it is time, a special attention is given to develop the youth of the nation and give them opportunities to thrive, if we are ready to move forward.” He said, “It is sad that Nigerian youths are using their talents abroad to develop other people’s countries, while back home they are frustrated and rejected before traveling out to search for better opportunities, thus causing brain drain in the country. He charged the youth to take their destinies in their hands by participating fully in the electoral process and ensure credible people are elected into political offices to represent them, saying “they are the leaders of today and their future is now”. According to him, “the youth must not sit on the fence, they must participate in politics. They should not sell their votes to the highest bidder, but elect credible people with capacity to serve and make things change for the better. “The PDP is youth friendly, and that is why I’m there. When given the opportunity to serve, I would not only lobby to protect the youth but the aged, children, female and all, by lobbying for Shomolu constituency ll to develop and create an enabling environment for people to thrive.”
