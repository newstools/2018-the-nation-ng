Access Bank Plc has restated its unalloyed commitment to positioning Africa as a continent viable for business and investment. This follows the announcement of its five-year strategic plan which, amongst other things, focuses on Africa in relation to the global community. This direction accentuates the bank’s current drive to enhance the perception of Africa by drawing the attention of the global community to the indigenous products of Africans; their rich culture, Arts and lifestyle as well as providing essential channels through which individuals, families, and businesses can fully participate in global commercial activities seamlessly. The Group Managing Director/CEO of Access Bank, Herbert Wigwe, while speaking about the bank’s direction, stressed that the focus is a continuation of an existing passion of the Bank to ensure that the world sees and appreciates the true representation of Africa.  “Over time, we have remained committed to raising the standard of banking practice in Africa without compromising the importance of our customers,” said Wigwe. “Throughout our years of operation, we have realised how large the African continent has become, not only in terms of its viable business environment, but also the uniqueness of its people, culture, resources and lifestyle. These are the stories we are happy to share and we are committed to take on a pivotal role in leading this charge over the next five years,” he added. Access Bank is leveraging on technology, especially with its positive track record of innovative products such as the Access Africa; its cross-border transfer service, which is the fastest way to send and receive money across Africa, PayDay Loan and the recently launched Access WhatsApp Banking service.
