Party officials across Irewole Local Govt area are all locked up in crucial meetings to fine tune strategies for victories on Saturday. Several efforts by this reporter for interviews with party chieftains in the local government has continued to hit brick-walls even till 10:15pm today. For instance, this reporter on three occasions made efforts to speak with PDP stalwarts in Ikire. One of the stalwarts, Peter Babalola, was said to be in a “crucial” meeting since 2pm. The Nation’s return visit on two other occasions to Babalola ‘s Ikire home yielded no positive result. Another PDP strongman in Ikire, Lere Oyewunmi, was said to be in Oshogbo, the state capital, finalising last minute strategies. When traced to his filling station along ikire-Ife expressway, he was also said to be unavailable although his G Wagon Mercedes Ben SUV was parked in front of the station. The Nation approached his wife after sighting in her mini mart located inside the filling station, which also yielded no fruits. A similar trip to the residence of Olayiwola Falabi, the SDP deputy gubernatorial candidate was fruitless. One of Falabi’s aides who attended to this reporter at the gate said he was in a crucial meeting. Similarly at the residence of Soji Ajayi of the ADP, the same scenario played out. The reporter was told by Ajayi’s aide to return art a later time. Perhaps indications that these party officials were only using the crucial meeting as an excuse to avoid the press played out at the residence of the APC member of the Osun State House of Assembly representing Ikire, Mr. Akinola Azifa. Arriving at Azifa’s residence, one of his aides after confirming his presence returned to say he was not at home. Reluctantly, the aide went back to Azifa and returned to say the usual “Oga is in a crucial meeting, which he however asked that we speak on phone. “I am in a crucial meeting now. Maybe you should come back,” Azifa said.
