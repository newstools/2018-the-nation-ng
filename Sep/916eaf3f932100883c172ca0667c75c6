Super Eagles forward Odion Ighalo continued his scoring effort Saturday converting a 36th minute penalty for his Chinese Super League side Changchun Yitai. The feat is coming barely two weeks after he converted a penalty for the Super Eagles in 3-0 defeat of Seychelles in the 2019 Afcon qualifiers. The hosts consolidated in the 51st minute thanks to Serbian import Nemanja Pejčinović. Visiting Guizhou Zhicheng had no solution to problems posed by Ighalo and his teammates cheered on by massive home support. A third goal for Changchun Yitai came in the 83rd minute through Adrian Mierzejewski. Ighalo’s goal marked his 17th of the season The victory ensured that Yitai moved to the sixth position on the log with 29 points from 22 games. An elated coach of Changchun Yitai,Chen Jingang will however be hoping to his side picks some vital point away when they next confront Shanghai SIPG away on September 22nd.
