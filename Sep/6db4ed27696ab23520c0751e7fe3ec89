The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has announced Thursday September 27 as the new date for a rerun after Saturday’s inconclusive Osun State gubernatorial election. The Returning officer, Prof. Joseph Adeola Fiwape at at the end of the collation of votes had declared that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Senator Ademola Adeleke, won majority votes of 254,698 votes while the All Progressives Congress, (APC) Mr. Gboyega Oyetola, came second with 254,345 votes. Both leading candidates had a difference of about 354 votes. Fiwape said: “Unfortunately as the returning officer, it’s not possible to declare anybody as the clear winner of the election on the first ballot.” According to him, the total registered voters in the seven polling units where elections were cancelled is 3,498 votes. He said that since the figure was higher than the difference between the votes of the leading candidates, a re-run election had to be conducted. “From the analysis of the results we have the difference between the two leading parties is just 353 votes. The number of votes in polling units where election were cancelled is 3,498. To that effect, as retuning officer it is not possible to declare any party as clear winner of this election on the first ballot. “But I must commend the people of this state for being peaceful. The INEC, therefore, declare September 27 as date for a rerun election.  On the basis of this, I, declare the election inconclusive. I, Joseph Adeola Fiwape, hereby, declare this election inconclusive
