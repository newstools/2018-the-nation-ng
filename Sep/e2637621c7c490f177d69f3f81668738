After casting his vote, the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke, has assured his supporters that, if he is not rigged out by the authorities in charge of the process, he is sure of victory. Adeleke who arrived exactly 8am at his polling unit 009, Ward 2, Abogunde/Sagba registration area, Ede North, was the first to vote at the unit. The Card Reader Machine initially had difficulties authenticating his fingerprints but after about five minutes, he succeeded in doing his accreditation. The PDP flag bearer, who voted at about 8.07am, told reporters afterwards that so far everything was proceeding normally and that if it continues that way he is sure of victory. He said attempts were made to frustrate his bid, to destabilise him ahead of the election but everything failed in the end.
