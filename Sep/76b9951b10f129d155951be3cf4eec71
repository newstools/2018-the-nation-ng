The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday announced its preparation to thwart the buying and selling of votes during the Osun governorship election. A lecturer in the Department of History and International Studies, Osun State University, Prof. Siyan Oyewesor had in his lecture at the INEC institute, Abuja, called for a proper check of the menace of vote buying during elections. In the lecture, titled “Policy Dialogue on Osun Governorship Election: Critical Factors and What INEC should do to ensure successful polls,” the don recalled that vote buying was reported during the Edo and Ekiti governorship elections. He called on President Muhammadu Buhari to quickly give his assent to the electoral bill that he reportedly rejected, stressing that the Presidency and National Assembly to iron out the technical grey areas in the bill. Oyewesor was of the opinion that an assent to the bill would make votes count. Asked how the commission was planning to checkmate the scourge, the Osun State Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Mr. Olusegun Agbaje, admitted that vote buying had become an embarrassment to the commission. Agbaje however revealed that plans were underway to reposition the cubicles in the polling units to make it impossible for voters to display their ballot papers for a fee, after casting their votes. His words: “The commission has made itself clear on this issue that it is an embarrassing situation. And one of the ways that the commission has planned to check the development during the Osun State election is  to reposition all cubicles in such a way that it is not going to be easy for the voter after casting his vote to come out and display his ballot paper for people to see.” Agbaje said people must understand that neither vote selling nor buying would aid the nation’s democracy and future. He said the commission was already embarking on education of voters to curb vote buying.
