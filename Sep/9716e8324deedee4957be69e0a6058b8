Members of the Boys Brigade of Nigeria have been urged to remain law-abiding and not be involved in any untoward character capable of bringing disrepute to the body. The brigade’s National President, Sir Sunny Nnamdi Nwosu, at the 56th Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the group in Bariga yesterday, urged the members to be guided by the core values of the association. “You should continue to work closely with the Church you practice from; you should remain law-abiding and be respecters of the laws of the land especially as another general elections draws near in the country,” he said. He added that they should not use the privilege of the association to get involved in any untoward acts before, during and after the elections. “As another general election is around the corner, you are to obtain your Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs), identify with any party and vote for any candidate of your choice. You are free to contest for any positions if you are qualified,” he said. President, Lagos State Council of the Boys Brigade, Olusegun Paul Ladega, urged his members to continue to carry out their assignments without bias and remain undaunted in any circumstance they find themselves, noting that they should do their bidding with the utmost fear of God and respect for the laws of the land. He added that they should remain committed to the community service, noting that it is one of the core mandates of every member of the organisation. “Be disciplined and follow laid-down regulations. You must be against bad behaviours in the state and the church, and you must be keepers of the law of the land,” he said.
