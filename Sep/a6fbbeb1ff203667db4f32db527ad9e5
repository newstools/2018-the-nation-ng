Nollywood actor Adisa Afis Ademola has stated that his primary goal is to be a big director in the movie industry. Though, it’s two years ago, Afis is still relishing his TAMVAAS Award in South Africa where he was voted 2016 Best Upcoming Actor. “I still believe I have not done well as far as bringing out my best is concerned,” said the Lagos State Polytechnic graduate who never envisaged that he would be a celebrity and receiving accolades for his acting. “That is why I am still driving hard to be the best. My dream is big. I believe people hasn’t seeing much of me.” Afis, who was born in Mushin, Lagos, started acting five years ago and in 2017, produced his own movie which is titled ‘Igbo Kadara.’
