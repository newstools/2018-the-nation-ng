Lagos State Commissioner of Police (CP) Imohimi Edgal has ordered the arrest of Inspector Emmanuel Egba, who was seen with a bottle of beer. The police boss also ordered that the incident be investigated to ascertain its veracity. The picture of the Inspector holding a beer bottle was published by a newspaper yesterday. Reacting yesterday, Edgal said the inspector would be held, pending investigation. In a statement, spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said the Inspector claimed that he recovered the bottle from a driver. Oti said: “The attention of the Commissioner of Police has been drawn to a publication in which a police Inspector was caught on camera holding a bottle of beer. “The officer in question has been identified and arrested. He is Inspector Emmanuel Egba, a police motorcycle rider attached to Area ‘M’ Command, Idimu and not Rapid Response Squad (RRS). “When the Inspector was questioned by senior officers, he denied the allegation; stating that he recovered the beer bottle with liquid contents from a driver who was drinking right inside his car in traffic. “He feared that the driver might get himself intoxicated thereby endangering his life and that of other road users. “The case is however being investigated at the Command Provost Section and if his claim is found to be false, appropriate disciplinary action will be meted out to him after an Orderly Room Trial.”
