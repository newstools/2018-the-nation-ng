The Osun State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Mr. Isiaka Gboyega Oyetola, has denied any rift between him and the state governor,  Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, over last Saturday’s election. In a statement on Monday by the Director-General of the IleriOluwa  Campaign Organization, Hon. Ajibola Famurewa, the governorship candidate described as irrational the insinuations in some quarters that there was a rift between Oyetola and Aregbesola, saying those peddling the rumour are “detractors out to create disaffection within the APC camp ahead of Thursday’s governorship rerun.” He also described Aregbesola as the driver of the “governorship project,” saying he is a model of good governance and responsible leadership. Oyetola, who advised the people to ignore the rumour, commended the people of the state for turning out well and for conducting themselves in a peaceful manner during the last Saturday’s governorship election. Asking the people to resist provocation from the opposition who he said are desperate, Oyetola advised the people not to give the detractors any room to truncate the relative peace in the state. Oyetola said the people of the state had demonstrated a high level of democratic culture in the most keenly-contested election in Nigeria. According to him: “The Oyetola Campaign Organization commends the steadfastness of the people despite the commoditization of votes by the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). We are aware of the votes buying and selling strategy of the PDP. We are proud that the people are resisting the provocation and temptation to sell their conscience. “We appeal to the people to be vigilant and ready to jealously guard their votes on Thursday as the PDP have commenced massive commoditization of peoples mandate through massive purchase of voter cards.”
