The All Progressives Congress (APC) won in the supplementary election held in three units of Ife North and Ife South local governments on Thursday. At Unit 12, Ward 7, Adereti Village, Olode, Ife South Local Government, the party polled 283 votes to defeat Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) which got 15 votes. At Oyere village, Unit 2, Ward 10, Ife North Local Government, APC garnered 126 votes while PDP polled two votes. Similarly, at Unit 10, Ward 8, Osi, Ife South Local Government, APC scored 172 to beat PDP which polled 21 votes. The two parties were the top contenders in the election. At Olode village, there was a large turnout of voters and the exercise started at 8:00 am as slated. But the polling unit was besieged by huge number of politicians and hoodlums thereby creating tension at a stage in spite of the presence of heavy security. The exercise, however, went peacefully. Sorting started at 2:02 pm and was followed by counting.
Voters had defied the rain which started at about 9:30 am. Most of them stayed in the rain, maintaining their positions in the long queues. A total of 812 voters registered at the Olode polling unit but only 310 votes. Of the lot, six votes were voided. The crowd of voters and politicians left the polling unit satisfied. Security agencies represented at the venue included Soldiers, Navy, Police, Immigration, Civil defence and the DSS.
