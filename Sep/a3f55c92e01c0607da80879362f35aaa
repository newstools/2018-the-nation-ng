Chairman Senate Committee on Petroleum (Downstream) Kabiru Marafa yesterday said that he was fully prepared to take part in governorship primaries of the All Progressives (APC) in Zamfara State. Marafa, in a statement, noted he and millions of his supporters across the state were participating based on the assurances that the exercise would be conducted through direct mode as directed by the leadership of APC. Marafa had earlier raised the alarm that he would not participate in the exercise on the allegation that the executive in the camp of Governor Abdul Aziz Yari would be used to coordinate the exercise. He said: “We are participating because they have assured us that the primary will be conducted through direct mode. “Two, they have assured us that the executive in the governor’s camp are not going to coordinate the primary election. “Based on these promises made by the party at the National level, INEC and security agencies, we are going into the election. I’m urging all my supporters across the state to come out to vote for me.” The Zamfara Central Senator expressed optimism that he would win the poll. “The way our party members trooped out on Thursday for the grand rally of my campaign, shows that they are solidly behind me. Insha Allah, (by God’s grace), I will win,” he said.
