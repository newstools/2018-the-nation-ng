In its quest to deepen the impact of the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), the Most Influential People of African Descent (MIPAD) has officially unveiled TECHsolves.org, a technology driven community platform. The global initiative was presented at a reception and closing gong ceremony held in honour of MIPAD Class of 2018 at the Nigerian Stock Exchange, penultimate Friday just as plans are in top gear for the global launch later in the year during MIPAD Recognition Week 2018 in New York following the opening of the UN General Assembly. While addressing members of the Nigerian Stock Exchange, MIPAD honourees and Intra-African Trade Fair representatives, serial entrepreneur and founder of specialist IT service company Futuresoft Nkemdilim Begho, stated that TECHsolves was specifically created to bring about feasible solutions to key issues on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals agenda which are currently the bane of developing nations like Nigeria by leveraging technology. “TECHsolves is all about problem solving ideas, funding and implementation. We aim at bringing together people who have the same vision and the same goals to brainstorm problem statements and come up with solutions that are viable and implementable for a better society,” Nkemdilim Begho.Begho further stated that the first in its series of challenges will be a voting Hackathon where participants will be tasked with creating a seamless online voting mechanism which can be implemented by trial, in the hopes that someday Nigeria and several other developing countries can experience easy, free and fair voting online, thus saving money, time and other key resources while awakening the populace to the numerous benefits and possibilities of ICT. Also speaking at the event, Alessia Balducci, GM Seedspace Lagos, Seedstars said, “TechSolves is an initiative that was born out of shared interest on how technology can be a driver for innovation and social change. We believe in leveraging on new and existing technology to make this world better for everyone. And Seedspace and MIPAD together want to do just that.”
