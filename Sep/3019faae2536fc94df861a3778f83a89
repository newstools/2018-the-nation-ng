The Nigeria Communication Commission (NCC) yesterday said it had put measures in place to ensure that consumers of telecoms products across the country are not shortchanged by operators. It said it would continue to empower consumers with adequate education on their rights and privileges through constant engagements at various levels across. Speaking at a one-day Consumer Outreach Programme (COP) in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State capital, its Executive Vice-Chairma/CEO, Prof. Umar Dambatta said the Commission was determined to ensure that consumers got value for their money through effective service delivery. Dambatta said the forum was one of the initiatives of the Commission to bring together consumers in the rural areas and the network operators to proffer solutions to the concerns of telecoms consumers. He said: â€œThe programme is to enable a tripartite meeting of the regulators, operators and consumers with a view to enlighten telecom consumers and resolve pressing consumers issues with respect to provision of telecom services.
