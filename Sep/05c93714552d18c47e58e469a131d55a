No fewer than twenty political parties under the umbrella of Alliance for Cooperating Political Parties (ACPP), have declared support for the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola in Thursday’s governorship rerun election in Osun State. Addressing a press conference in Osogbo on Wednesday, the leader of ACPP, comprising Advanced Democratic Congress, the National Conscience Party, People for Democratic Change, among others, Prince Adesoji Masilo, said the coalition threw its weight behind the candidature of Oyetola because of his intelligence and character. Masilo said that his party, African People’s Alliance, polled over 2,000 votes at the last Saturday’s governorship poll in the state, adding that over twenty political parties decided to support APC owing to the party’s progressive spirit. According to him, the APC has shown that it is capable of developing the state and that members of the coalition should troop out Thursday to cast their votes for the APC. Masilo, who decried the menace of vote buying that characterised last Saturday’s governorship election, said politicians should desist from such act. He said voters should refrain from selling their votes and ensure that they vote Oyetola.
