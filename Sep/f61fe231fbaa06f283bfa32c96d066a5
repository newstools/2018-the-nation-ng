Barely a year after moving to Paris Saint-Germain from Barcelona in a whooping €222 million deal, Brazil international Neymar is reportedly eager to head back t the Nou Camp. One of the reasons that propped up during the said transfer in August 2017, was Neymar desire to according to some analyst walk away from the shadows of Lionel Messi who is said having a domineering figure in the club. The dream return however appear to be head for the rocks as the Catalan giants are said to be reluctant to bring their former man back to the Nou Camp. Neymar, 26, scored 105 goals in 186 appearances for Barcelona between 2013 and 2017, before completing a world-record move to PSG in last summer’s transfer window. The Brazilian has netted 32 times in 35 appearances for PSG since his arrival, but suggestions that the attacker is unsettled in France have gathered pace in recent months. According to Mundo Deportivo, Neymar almost instantly regretted his move to Paris, and is not happy with the emergence of Kylian Mbappe, who has taken some of the limelight away from the Brazilian. The report claims that the attacker also feels targeted by opposition defences in Ligue 1, and is determined to secure a return to Camp Nou. However, it is understood that Barcelona are not currently interested in re-signing the forward, with Real Madrid his most likely destination if PSG agree to sell. Ousmane Dembele – signed to replace Neymar – has impressed for Barcelona in the early stages of the 2018-19 campaign.
