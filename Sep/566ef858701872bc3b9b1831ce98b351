The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Primary earlier scheduled for tomorrow will now hold on September 25, the party’s national headquarters yesterday announced in a revised timetable for its primaries. A statement signed by the National Organising Secretary, Emma Ibediro also announced new dates for other primary elections. It rescheduled the governorship primary for September 29, four days after the presidential primary. The National Assembly primary will hold on October 2 (Senate) and October 3 (House of Representatives). The state Houses of Assembly primary will hold on October 4. The National Convention of the party to affirm the party’s Presidential candidate is expected to hold on 6th October as earlier scheduled. No explanation was given for the shift in dates earlier announced for the primaries, but The Nation discovered that the screening of aspirants was yet to begin as at the time of this report. The screening committees for aspirants into the various categories of offices were yet to be inaugurated. It was gathered that the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) of the party was working round the clock to avoid major crisis after party primaries. In many of the APC states, members have been battling to agree on the mode of primary to adopt for the conduct of the primaries. Some stakeholders support direct primaries. Others favour the use of direct primaries and a few have embraced consensus mode.
