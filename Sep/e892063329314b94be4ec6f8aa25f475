The Comptroller-General (CG), Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS), Muhammad Babandede, has vowed to continue to re –position Nigerian borders patrol to deal with security threats in the country. Officers, he said, will be moved to compliment others at the borders for effective patrol. Babandede said this in Abuja at the commissioning of the NIS fire station. He disclosed that the Minister of Interior, Lt Gen. Abdulrahman Dambazau (rtd) has  commissioned a new border patrol base in Katsina. The NIS boss said: “The new boarder patrol base is a new border for patrol. We have a patrol post where people will go for checking before they cross. We have border patrol but we do not have a base. “In 2017 we have established 5 border patrol base. One of which will be commissioned by the minister tomorrow in Jibia. The intention is that most of our officers are not going to be sleeping there and they will be on patrol. They are not going to patrol roads where people follow but the border.” On the commissioning of the fire station, Babandede commended the efforts of the fire management at establishing a station at the NIS headquarters, adding that it will not only service the NIS but also the entire vicinity. He said the fire station is long over due considering what fire outbreak is capable of doing. Babandede assured that his men will make the right use of the fire equipment. The Controller General of the Federal Fire Service, Joseph Anebi, who disclosed that one of the fire fighting vehicles cost N188 million, said all levels of government, private organisations, traditional and religious institutions and individuals respectively have roles to play in ensuring that fire outbreak and the mitigation of its effect in the event of its occurrence are reduced to the barest minimum.
