Afenifere chieftain Senator Ayo Fasanmi has urged the people of Osun State to vote for the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, to ensure continuity in governance. Fasanmi said now that Governor Rauf Aregbesola has laid a good foundation for Osun State, the people should cast their votes for the APC candidate. He cited Lagos State as an example where continuity in governance has paid off. According to him, the foundation of developments taking place in Lagos today was laid by the former governor, Senator Bola Tinubu. “Now that Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola has laid a good foundation for Osun, which his successor will follow, the best way to appreciate the good work he has done is to cat our votes for the progressive governance”. He advised the government to address the problems of workers. “Our governor is a man of the people. I know he would not let the people of Osun down. Our candidate, Gboyega, is a gentle man indeed. I have the confidence that he will perform and do better.” The elder statesman urged the people to allow peace to reign before, during and after the July 22 governorship election.
