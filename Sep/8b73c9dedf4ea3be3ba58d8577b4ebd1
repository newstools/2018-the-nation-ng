THE Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) has announced the opening of its loan application process for small businesses and startups operating in the state. Applicants intending to secure funding of up to N500,000 can apply at five per cent interest under the LSETF Loan Programme, beginning Monday, September 3, to close on Sunday, September 30. Applicants can obtain forms at LSETF’s liaison offices across the 20 local government offices and submit completed forms at the same location, or apply online via the LSETF website, www.lsetf.ng, from Monday. As part of the requirements, applicants should attach proof of residency registration with Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASRRA), tax identification, training certificate (for Startups), passport photographs and details of guarantors. In addition, existing micro enterprises should show proof of sales evidenced by sales records or bank statements for six months. LSETF’s Executive Secretary Mr. Akintunde Oyebode said the process was free and open to operators, who are residents, irrespective of their tribe, gender, religion or political affiliation. “This loan application window is a follow up to our existing loan programme where the fund has disbursed almost N6 billion to 7,000 beneficiaries. The month-long application window is possible following the process optimisation we carried out as a result of the huge backlog we had to deal with having recorded an overwhelming response to the open and rolling application process we had running before. Going forward, the LSETF applications will be accessible at periodic windows as we have it now. So I call on qualified small businesses to apply as soon as possible before the close of the application window,” Mr. Oyebode said.
