Former Super Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh was in a nostalgic mood Monday as he wondered why the passion for the Nigeria league appears to have disappeared into thin air. The former Borussia Dortmund defensive midfielder took to the social media to display an old picture of one of the crowd pulling encounters in the local league. It was the match between Rangers international and Bendel Insurance in 1978. Interestingly Rangers international have managed to remain in the top flight 40 years down the line. Oliseh who left his job as Super Eagles coach just after the 2016 edition of the Championship of African Countries (CHAN) held in Rwanda noted that preference for foreign league has become the new passion. Oliseh’s worry for the local league is coming at time when the league board has been boxed into a corner following CAF deadline for all Federations to submit their representatives in Continental champions before October 15.  Unfortunately the Nigerian league was suspended just before the world cup in Russia and could resume no thanks to unending battle for the soul of the Glass House. With only 24 games played in the embattled season, the league Management Company and club owners decided that the team at the top of the league should represent the country in the CAF Champions league. “Upon consideration of different options (5 possible options were presented), it was unanimously agreed by the 20 NPFL Clubs, that the 2017/2018 season of the NPFL is deemed concluded and the team at the top of the standings – Lobi Stars shall be the representative in the CAF Champions League for 2019 Session starting Nov 2018 to May 2019,” the statement read. “No team shall be relegated from the NPFL for 2018 Season.  Four Teams shall be promoted to the NPFL from the Nigeria National League (NNL) from the ongoing 2018 season to compete in the 2018/2019 NPFL season. “The 2018/2019 NPFL season will commence in November 2018 with a total of 24 participating teams, which shall be divided into two groups of 12 teams each. The 2018/2019 Season commencing November 2018 will be played on 22 Match days ending with a Playoff to determine the Winner by May 2019. “Three teams from each group (a total of six) will be relegated from the NPFL after the conclusion of the 2018/2019 season, while two teams will be promoted to the NPFL from the NNL 2019 Season. This will allow the NPFL to revert to its normal structure of 20 teams as from the 2019/2020 season” Some stakeholders have reasoned that it will take a miracle to return to the nostalgic days being referred to by Oliseh, noting that lack of focus and foresight coupled with inordinate quest for power and supremacy has not only affected the league but has forced a reduction in people interest in the league.
