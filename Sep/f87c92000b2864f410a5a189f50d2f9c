Some residents of Shogunle, Lagos yesterday counted their losses in a flood. According to them, the downpour between Friday and yesterday damaged their properties. The flood, they said, entered their homes and shops. Nwazue Uzodime of 10 Fabukade Street, said a customer called him that his shop was flooded around 7am. “I rushed out and all I could see was water everywhere. When I opened my shop, it was filled with water; the whole road was covered with flood which damaged the properties of the residents. The flood was heavy; it dragged a container shop used for lotto inside the canal,” he said, adding: “I am lucky because I don’t sell consumables. The people that were affected were my neighbours that sell consumables. It was only my generator, television and standing fan that was soaked but all my sellable goods were intact.” Another resident, who simply introduced himself as Adex, said: “This is what we experience whenever it rains heavily. The flood dragged cars, motorcycles and tricycles into the canal.” The community, he said, had been appealing to the Oshodi-Isolo Local Government and Lagos State government to come to their aid but to not avail. Chidi Judge said lack of good drainage was the cause of the incessant flood. “We have been experiencing this flood disaster for a long time. When rain falls at night, we will sleep with one eye closed and the other opened,” he said.
