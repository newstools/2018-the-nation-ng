The Nigeria Women Trust Fund (NWTF) and the Gender and Election Watch (GEW) in collaboration with the European Union Support to Democratic Governance (EUSDGN) yesterday said the menace of vote buying has taken a new twist. Addressing reporters after the conclusion of the state governorship election, the CEO of NWTF, Mufuliat Fijabi, said in spite of the effort of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to curb the menace the trend “seems to have continued using creative, discreet and advanced means.” Fijabi said the observation of the NWTF and GEW was informed by reports of the two bodies’ 63 deployed observers. According to her, the report also showed that there was a impressive turn out of people for the exercise, adding considerable number of women were sighted participating in the election. They advised there should be strict measures to detect and hold accountable vote buyers and sellers. The groups also advised the INEC to increase its efficiency in supporting the participation of persons with disabilities in subsequent elections.
