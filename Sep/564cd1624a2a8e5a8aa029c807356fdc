APC is party to beat, says Omoworare From Joseph Jibueze, Ile-Ife The Senator representing Osun East, Babajide Omoworare, has backed his party the All Progressives Congress (APC) to win the state’s governorship election. He said the APC, with its candidate Gboyega Oyetola, is the party to beat. Speaking with reporters after casting his vote, Omoworare said opposition parties criticising the APC have not presented better alternatives. He said: “Sincerely, I feel APC will win, and I feel APC will also meet the requirements of enjoying two-thirds of votes cast in the state. “APC is the party to beat. That’s the truth of the matter. It’s not because APC is the incumbent government. “APC has provided the best candidate and APC has defended its policies. I’ve said it repeatedly. Those criticising APC’s policies have not proffered better alternatives.” Omoworare said the Southwest remains a progressive region and will always vote accordingly. Senator Omoworare voted in Unit 13, Iremo Ward III in Ife Central, where his party was beaten by the Social Democratic Party (SDP).   42 motorcycles impounded at Ikire for breaking restriction order.

The Lowa Adimula of Ife, High Chief Adekola Adeleye, who said he is the Ooni’s second in command “to the left”, explained that the Ooni cannot be seen to be taking sides with any of the candidates. There is a polling unit by the Ooni’s palace, but he did not come out to vote. “It’s not good for the Ooni to vote for any candidate. If he must vote, it will be for all the candidates because he’s the father of all, but that’s not possible, so kingmakers advised him not to vote. “He cannot take sides. All the candidates are Ooni’s subjects and so it’s better for a father to be neutral when his children are in a contest,” Adeleye told our reporter. Ooni’s traditional Aide De Camp said the royal father only blessed all the candidates, wished them well and prayed for a peaceful election.
