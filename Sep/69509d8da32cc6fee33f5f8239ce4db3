To promote the benefits of cycling among secondary school students, the African Cycling Foundation, has concluded arrangement to host the third edition of the Schools Cycling Challenge (SCC) between September 20 and 21 at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. The President of the foundation, Mr Yemi Osilaja explained that the primary goal of the SCC is to promote greater interest in regular cycling, to encourage schools to establish cycling clubs and include cycling in their sports curriculum. “We also aim to use the SCC as a platform to educate the youth about the many health and environmental benefits of the sport. “We plan to hold the programme in all six geo-political zones of Nigeria. As the SCC grows in popularity across the country, we expect to discover and groom young talents that will represent Nigeria on the world cycling circuit one day”. He continued “Cycling is an excellent sport for achieving sustainable wellness for both the young and the old. We need the government to provide the necessary infrastructure for the growth of cycling in Nigeria. We need dedicated bicycle lanes and signage so that more people can enjoy regular and safe cycling. We also need private organisations to provide robust support for the development of cycling in Nigeria.”
