Boris Johnson has attacked Theresa’s May’s Brexit plan, saying she had “wrapped a suicide vest” around the British constitution and “handed the detonator” to Brussels. In the Mail yesterday, the former foreign secretary said the Chequers deal was “feeble” and “pathetic”. He has been strongly criticised by some Tories – one minister said it marked a “disgusting moment” in politics. And Home Secretary Sajid Javid called for “measured language” to be used. Writing in the same paper, the current Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt called for people to rally behind Mrs May, backing her to hold the line “in the face of intense pressure”. The UK is leaving the EU on 29 March 2019, and the government’s plan – agreed at Chequers in July – has sparked criticism from Brexiteer Tories as well as the EU. In his article, Mr Johnson accused the EU of “bullying” the UK – but questioned why the response had been “so utterly feeble”. He said that rather than getting a “generous free trade deal”, Britain is saying, “yes sir, no sir, three bags full sir”, to Brussels. “At every stage of the talks so far, Brussels gets what Brussels wants,” wrote Mr Johnson. “It is a humiliation. We look like a seven-stone weakling being comically bent out of shape by a 500lb gorilla.”
