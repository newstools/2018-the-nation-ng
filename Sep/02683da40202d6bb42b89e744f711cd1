About 200 members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have defected to the opposition Peoples Democratic Party at Ogbonna in Estako Central local government area. The defectors were led by a former Chairman of the APC in the locality, Dr. Peter Itabor Amarekhamhe. Dr. Itabor said they left the APC because several promises of the party were not fulfilled. Itabor stated that youths and women in the area have not benefitted from any of the empowerment packages of the federal government. He promised to work for the victory of the PDP in the locality. State Chairman of the PDP, Chief Dan Orbih, who received the defectors said the PDP would defeat Comrade Adams Oshiomhole in Edo North in next yearâ€™s general election. Chief Orbih said the defectors were disappointed with the harsh economic conditions and insecurity in the country. Orbih promised to provide a level playing field for the defectors.
