Kwara youths under the aegis of All Progressives Youth Forum (APYF) have promised to work for the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 election. The group urged the Buhari administration to pay special attention to the state to capture it from a retrogressive government. Coordinator of the forum Tunde Salau hailed the reappointment of Minister of Transportation Rotimi Ameachi as the Director-General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation for 2019 elections. He said: “Ameachi’s re-appointment as Director-General of the Buhari Campaign Organisation is a recognition of his doggedness, consistency and commitment towards the success of the President Buhari-led administration, coupled with his achievements as the minister of transportation. “We urge Ameachi and his team to pay attention to Kwara State when campaign activities fully kick off. The people, especially the youths, are tired of the retrogressive style of leadership in the last 16 years. “APYF and its members also assure Ameachi of their readiness to mobilise youths for the party’s victory in 2019.”
