A girl was on Wednesday burnt to death in a commercial bus gutted by fire at the Lekki-Epe Expressway tollgate. It was gathered that the fire was caused by electrical faults in the engine. A source said the kid’s mother, who was carrying her younger sibling, ran out of the bus without her. It was learnt that other passengers also jumped out, leaving the girl behind. The source told The Nation that the child was burnt beyond recognition, adding that the body was handed over to the State Environmental Health Management Unit (SEHMU). “The bus was totally burnt. Even its tyres were burnt. They said the child’s mother was carrying another baby. As soon as the fire started, she ran out with a baby and forgot the other one. “Other passengers in the bus also ran for their lives. No one took the kid. She was burnt to death. The body was recovered by emergency workers. “The incident caused serious traffic but the agencies that responded tried to manage the situation.”
