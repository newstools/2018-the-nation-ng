Residents of Ijora, Badia have appealed to the Lagos State government to rid their community of cultists. The Nation learnt that the cultists are having a field day in the community. A resident, Mr Egbeyemi Idris, recalled that some people were killed in a cult war few weeks ago. “Last month, there was a case between the Aiye and Eiye cult groups. One of the Eiye members was shot by a member of the Aiye group, which made the two groups go into war. The battle lasted for two days; some people were killed and many injured. The cult members also destroyed the windscreens of cars that were parked nearby,” he said A resident, who simply gave his name as Sola, said: “Cultism in our community is a serious case; we live in fear of the cultists and can’t walk around the community freely without being embarrassed by them. They attack young boys and girls and force them to join them in their various cult groups. We need the help of the government for we can’t fight them ourselves.” The councillor, representing Ijora Oloye Ward E, Liadi Saheed, said the council would do everything to reduce cultism in the community. “The Local Government Chairman, Alhaja Funmilayo Akande-Muhammed, myself and the Ijora monarch have carried out sensitisation programmes to enlighten the people on the dangers of cultism. We have also set an example by charging cultists caught to to court. I can assure you that soon cultism will be a thing of the past in this community as the government is taking every step necessary to stamp it out,” he said.
