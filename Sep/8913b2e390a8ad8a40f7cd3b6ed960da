Raheem Alan, a PDP agent in Ward 9 Unit 3, told The Nation that although voters were initially delayed at the entry point to the voting arena, it was for security reasons. “Once the security personnel were convinced nobody came to the voting arena with any form of dangerous weapons they allowed us into the arena freely,” he said. Olaniyi Tairu, APA agent said there is not a single threat by security personnel. “In fact, we need them more here; they are protecting us.”
In similar vein, Nimota Kolawole ACD agent in the unit, said tales of intimidation or prevention of people from voting are all lies. “Nobody has been denied voting right here; I have been here since 7:30am. Please don’t believe such stories.” she explained. Kolawole said initially the community was apprehensive on sighting the heavy presence of security personnel. He however said realising their presence was for their security, they calmed down and trooped out to vote. “What happened on Saturday cannot be allowed to happen today. We thank the security officers here,” she submitted.
