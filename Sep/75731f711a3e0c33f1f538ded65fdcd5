The United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union observer team said yesterday it would investigate reports of irregularities in the Osun state supplementary governorship election. A member of the team told reporters in Osogbo, the state capital, that they heard about irregularities, harassment and interference by inappropriate persons in the election. “We are very concerned by these reports and will be checking the facts with stakeholders. We call on all stakeholders to remain calm,” he said. Another observer group, the Centre for Democracy and Development, said: “In the light of these anti-democratic acts, which have undermined the sanctity of the ballot therefore, we hold strongly the view that the re-run poll of Thursday, September 27, 2018 does not meet up with the minimum standards for free, fair and credible elections.”
