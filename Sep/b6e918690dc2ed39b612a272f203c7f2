The Katsina state government has assured vigilante groups in the state, under the aegis of Katsina State Security Group, of adequate support and empowerment through the provision of needed gadgets and transports, to enable them contribute effectively to the maintenance of stable security in the state especially in the rural areas Governor Aminu Bello Masari, who was represented by the Secretary to the state Government, Dr Mustapha Inuwa, gave the assurance at the state secretariat, while receiving the executive members of the state vigilante groups, who visited the state government to show solidarity and solicit official recognition of their activities. The Chairman of the group, Abdullahi Lolo told the SSG that the association is self funded and voluntary and would therefore require government support especially in the area a of transports and communication gadgets He said “Often we are confronted with a situation in the middle of the night where a pregnant woman in labour and needing urgent transportation could not be assisted because we don’t have transports’’. ‘’Even when we arrest criminals, especially the hardened ones, we are unable to convey them to the nearest police stations as we cannot detain them either. Again we cannot communicate with our colleagues scattered all over the place, especially during critical moment due to lack of equipments’’ ‘’We know you and the governor are the same hence we offer prayers for Buhari and Masari also’’ Abdullahi further maintained that the group needed such equipment like bows and arrows, raincoats and torch lights, stationeries, and an office building. He said they could not build their office on an empty land donated by the local chiefs due to lack of funds. Responding, Dr Inuwa commended the association for their contributions towards ensuring the security of lives and properties in the state. He urged them to also help government in tackling the menace of drug abuse n the state. He promised that their requests will be looked into by the state government with a view to addressing them He said “Governments everywhere is primarily concerned with protection of lives and property. We alone cannot perform all security functions without your support’’ “What you people are doing is not a small work but we know God will reward you. We will look into your request and see how government can assist you’’
