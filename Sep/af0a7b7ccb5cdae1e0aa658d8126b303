The Akwa Ibom Police Command has arrested a couple for allegedly operating a baby factory at Owot-Uta community in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area. The woman, identified simply as Mrs. Godwin and a native of Afaha Offiong in Nsit Ibom Local Government Area, was apprehended few days ago by operatives of the Anti-Kidnap Squad of the police command at a private clinic, where she works. Following her arrest, the police invaded her home yesterday on Transformer-Uruantang Road, Owot-Uta in Ibesikpo Asutan Local Government Area and arrested her husband. The police reportedly seized a 2007 model Toyota Camry car from the couple. It was learnt that trouble started when a woman, who was recently delivered of a baby, opted to sell it to raise money for her upkeep. Mrs. Godwin, who alleged negotiated the sale of the baby at an undisclosed amount, reportedly breached the sharing formula after the baby was sold. This was said to have led to a quarrel between her and the baby’s mother, who reportedly wanted a greater share of the money. Feeling cheated and angry, the baby’s mother reported the matter to the police, giving details of the shady deal between her and the suspect. The police were said to have arrested her and the baby’s mother. Police spokesman Odiko McDon, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) said he was not aware of the incident. “I have not been briefed on the incident. I am just hearing of it from you. But I hope before the day ends, the Anti-Kidnapping squad will inform me properly on the matter,” he said.
