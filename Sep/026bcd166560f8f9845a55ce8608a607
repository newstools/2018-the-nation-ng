A 20-year-old woman, Zulac Kabiru, has confessed to killing her eight-month-old stepdaughter, Rukaiya, to teach her co-wife how to respect “her superior” by giving her local insecticide, otapiapia, to drink. Zulac, who was arrested by the police in Niger State for alleged killing at Danauta village in Mariga Local Government Area, said she took the action because the second wife was always insulting and assaulting her. The suspect was said to have secretly given the baby the poison, which resulted in her death. It was gathered that the suspect and her fellow wife had not been in good terms for a long time. Addressed reporters when she was paraded, Zulac said: “I warned my husband to desist from getting another wife but he did not listen. The second wife loved insulting and assaulting me at all times. One day, I decided to poison her eight-month-old daughter to increase her sorrow in the family so that she will learn how to respect her superiors in the family. “Before my husband married her, and I kicked against it, we were living in peace. But when she came, she split the family. My husband gave her more attention than he gave me. Snd since then, our family has been in shambles.” The suspect said she did not know when she carried out the act. According to her, it was the work of the devil. “It was the work of the devil. I don’t know when I did it. It is a wicked act,” she said. Police spokesman Muhammad Abubakar, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the suspect would be arraigned in court after investigation.
