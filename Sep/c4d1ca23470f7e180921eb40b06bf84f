Bournemouth midfielder Ryan Fraser is a doubt for Saturday’s English Premier League clash against Leicester City after sustaining a hamstring injury on international duty with Scotland, manager Eddie Howe said on Friday. Fraser played the full 90 minutes of Scotland’s 4-0 defeat by World Cup semi-finalists Belgium in a friendly at Hampden Park last weekend before returning with the injury. “Ryan had a hamstring problem so has been working with our medical team since he returned here,” Howe told reporters. The 32-year-old has started all four matches for Bournemouth this season and scored in the 2-0 victory over promoted Cardiff City in their league opener. Howe said defender Charlie Daniels was another injury concern, having picked up a niggle in the international break but was happy to welcome midfielder Junior Stanislas back from a knee problem. “Junior is working his way back to fitness. A big positive was that he came back into training during the international break. He won’t be ready for this weekend but we’re pleased with his progress,” Howe added. Bournemouth is sixth in the standings with seven points from four matches.
