Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on Wednesday urged the media to focus on developmental issues that could positively impact the country rather than propagate hate speech or engage in fake news. Okowa, represented by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr Charles Aniagwu, gave the charge at the 5th Annual Conference of the Association of Communication Scholars and Professionals of Nigeria (ACSPN) in Asaba. The conference has the theme: “Media Narratives: Hate Speech, Fake News and Political Stability in Africa”. According to him, hate speeches and fake news would remain a challenge to the country until Nigerians imbibed the attitude of nationalism to conquer them. He said that the media had the responsibility of ensuring development in the country and unity of its people. “The media has the onerous responsibility of setting the agenda, but today, the media is rather propagating the agenda thereby giving room for hate speech and fake news,” he said. The governor said all Nigerians, including media practitioners, had the collective responsibility to make the country progress. “I want to plead with the media, members of the pen profession, and the entire Nigerians to realise that we have no other country but Nigeria. “It is our responsibility to ensure its existence and to develop it,” the governor said. The Chairman of the occasion, Prof. Sam Oyovbaire, said it had become a daunting task to curb hate speeches and fake news. Oyovbaire said modern trend and advent of new technologies and the social media had made it difficult to curb hate speeches and fake news. He said it had become difficult for regulating agencies to check hate speeches and fake news.
