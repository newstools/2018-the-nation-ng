The former world No. 5 Anne Chakvetadze has deeply analysed the controversial case involving Serena Williams and the umpire Carlos Ramos at the US Open. ‘Carlos Ramos did everything according to rules’, Chakvetadze recognised. ‘The camera recorded it, the video can show it. You cannot blame the umpire because he did everything according to rules. The coach gave a suggestion. Serena broke her racquet. Williams spoke to the umpire and described him as a cheater and a thief. In some ways, I can understand Serena, because it was a very emotional match for her. In general, at the US Open, it always happens something to her. It started in 2004 when, after a clear umpire’s error, Mariana Alves Capriati won the quarter-finals match. Serena’s ball bounced on the court by 20 centimetres, but for some reasons, judges did not see it. Just after that incident, the Hawk-Eye system got introduced. Mentally, it marked Serena. Obviously, the match was not in her favour. Osaka played brilliant, but Serena struggled a lot and it is not the first time. You can remember the match with (Kim) Clijsters when she went to the judge and said she would have thrown the ball to her. Serena’s behaviour was too match.’ ‘Osaka faced the speed of Williams’s game. Her nerves were strong ones. It’s difficult to determine if she deliberately tried to put Serena off the clash when Serena discussed with the judge, but these breaks and controversies may have influenced. Sometimes, the athlete takes a medical timeout and after a break, the opponent gets “cold” and cannot play anymore.’
