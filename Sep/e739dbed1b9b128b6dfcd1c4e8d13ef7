Jubilant market women in Enugu State on Friday, converged on the Government House, Enugu to express their firm support for the re-election of Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi in 2019 for entrenching peace and good governance in the state, and assisting traders in the state grow their businesses. The traders, who described Ugwuanyi as “the most trader-friendly governor”, disclosed that “we have never had it so good like this since the inception of civilian regime in 1999.” The women added that Ugwuayin is the only governor of the state, who came on board and remembered the welfare of the traders, stressing that they are supporting his re-election because he cares for them and the masses. Presenting their stance, the state’s Market Woman Leader, Hon.

She noted the women have benefited immensely from the empowerment programme, expressing delight with the governor’s passion for the wellbeing of the traders, saying: “Every day, what he is thinking is what he can do for market traders in Enugu State.” Hon. Edeh maintained that the market women in Enugu State have resolved to work for Ugwuanyi’s re-election. Her words: “Daddy, the reason why we are here is to thank you and also tell you that whatever you want in Enugu State as it concerns traders, we will give it to you double. We have come to say to you that in this Lion Building, there is no vacancy, come 2019.” Responding, Ugwuanyi thanked the women for their support, solidarity and prayers, assuring them of his resolve to continue to serve the people of the state with the fear of God and to improve their living standard.
