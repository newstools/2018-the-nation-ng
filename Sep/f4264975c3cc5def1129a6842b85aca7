A Lagos High Court in Igbosere Thurday adjourned Friday further hearing in the trial of suspected ‘billionaire’ kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike alias Evans, following the prosecution witness’ absence. Justice Adedayo Akintoye fixed the date following assurances from prosecution counsel Adebayo Haroun that the witness, a Police Inspector, would be available to testify Friday. Haroun told the judge that the Inspector was engaged elsewhere on official assignment. “The witness is on another assignment. But he will be here tomorrow,” he said. The trial, which last held on June 26, 2018, should have resumed Thursday following the end of the annual vacation for judges. Evans is facing two separate charges bordering on conspiracy to kidnap, kidnapping and attempted murder, before Justice Akintoye. In the first charge, Evans is standing trial alongside Joseph Emeka, Ugochukwu Nwachukwu and Victor Aduba. In the second charge, he is standing trial alongside Joseph Emeka, Linus Okpara and Victor Aduba. Both trials were adjourned till Friday. Evans is also facing two other charges before Justice Oluwatoyin Taiwo, and a fifth one before Justice Hakeem Oshodi. In one of the two charges before Justice Taiwo, the Lagos State Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) accused Evans and three others of killing two persons in their failed attempt to kidnap the Chairman of Young Shall Grow Motors, Obianodo Vincent. The criminal operation was said to have been carried out by the defendants around 11pm on August 27, 2013 on Third Avenue, FESTAC Town, Lagos. Those charged along with Evans were Joseph Emeka, Chiemeka Arinze and Udeme Upong.
The seven counts against them border on attempted murder, murder, kidnapping and illegal firearms deal.
