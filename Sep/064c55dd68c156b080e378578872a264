A People’s Democratic Party (PDP) aspirant for the Kogi East Senatorial district, Victor Adoji, has described his clearance by the National Working Committee as positive. He stated this in a chat with newsmen shortly after receiving the certificate of clearance, adding that is was the beginning of a journey to offer quality representation. “This is an impetus to offer a representation that is unusual,” he said. He commended the PDP for its due diligence, assuring that under his representation, the Igala Bassa nation that has long been relegated would once again bounce back.
