The Vice-Chancellor, Ekiti State University (EKSU), Prof Samuel Oye Bandele has counselled newly matriculated students of the 2018 contact session of the institutionâ€™s sandwich degree to take their studies serious as the University would not tolerate laziness and indiscipline. Speaking at the matriculation last Friday, Bandele said the objectives of the sandwich programme alligned with the main objectives of the faculty of education to produce teachers at graduate and postgraduate levels, who have mastery of their subjects combined with academic and professional training in education. The Vice- Chancellor represented by the Deputy Vice- Chancellor Development, Prof Olubunmi Ajayi told the students that the University founded in 1982 boasts of world- class academics who had distinguished themselves in their areas of specialisation. Bandele said matriculation was a symbol of acceptance and incorporation into a community of intellectuals binding them to the ethics, ethos and values of the university. He charged the students to acquaint themselves with the rules and regulations of the university and shun bad behaviour. He warned that it was illegal for any student to engage in physical combat or assault and that if caught would be severely punished. He added that cultism, rape, and examination malpractices would attract expulsion. The Registrar, Mr Akin Arogundade administered the matriculation oath.
