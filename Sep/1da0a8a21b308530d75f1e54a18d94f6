Zinedine Zidane has hinted he will be returning to work soon following multiple reports that he is favourite to replace Jose Mourinho if the Portuguese is sacked by Manchester United. The former France midfielder has been without a job since resigning from his position as Real Madridboss after helping them to a third consecutive Champions League crown in May. But speaking with Spanish broadcaster TVE, he revealed that he’ll back in the game very shortly. Zidane said: ‘Yes, surely. Soon I will return to training because it is what I like and is what I have done all my life.’ Zidane’s speculation first started after a frustrating summer in the transfer market and a poor start to the season which has seen Mourinho’s team lost two of their first four games. A recent report by The Mirror claimed that Zidane was already preparing for life in the Old Trafford hot-seat by compiling a list of transfer targets. Toni Kroos, Thiago Alcantara, James Rodriguez and Edinson Cavani are said to be among a list of names that Zidane would like to join him in Manchester should he be appointed as Mourinho’s successor.
