The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria ( FAAN ), has announced the reopening of Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, following an incident involving a Gulfstream four aircraft being operated by Skybird on Wednesday night. A statement by Mrs Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, Corporate Affairs, FAAN, on Thursday disclosed that the aircraft overshot the Runway while landing and consequently got stuck on the Runway End Safety Area (RESA). Yakubu said that FAAN had reopened the Runway to take arrivals and departures, subject to a reduced threshold of 3000 metres. She assured airlines and passengers that the airport was safe for normal operations, adding that FAAN was committed to her core values of safety, security and comfort. “This is following the partial closure of Runway 22, Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, at about 2200hours, on Wednesday night. The closure was due to an incident involving a Gulfstream four aircraft being operated by Skybird that overshot the Runway while landing and consequently got stuck on the Runway End Safety Area (RESA),” she said.
