Captain of Owena Queens of Akure, Tosin Egbebiyi has attributed her team’s 34-25 loss to Plateau Peacock to fatigue and poor officiating. Owena Queens arrived in Lagos 3 am on Wednesday and played the opening game by 7.30am. Much as they tried, the Queens became tired towards the end of the game and it was clear it wasn’t going to be there day. Ebgbebiyi stated that it was sad that her team could not arrive early due to logistic reasons, assuring that the team would get better as the competition progresses. He also blamed officiating for their woes urged the referee to do better in subsequent games. “I can say that the officiating wasn’t too good against Peacocks. The referees gave their best but I am sure that they can still do better. Their performance will go a long way in deciding which team wins the tournament.” She also said that her team would correct all the mistakes made as they hope to beat high-flying Seasiders Babes of Lagos in today’s encounter. “We know the Seasiders are a tough team but we can beat them if we get out tactics right.” In some other games today, Sokoto Rima will take on Prison Key Boys, Abia Valiants will confront Imo Grasshoppers, Kada Queens battle Safety Babes and D Defenders take on Plateau Vipers.
