Lagos State Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgal yesterday warned criminals, especially cultists, to keep off the state. The police chief said the peace reigning across the state was sacrosanct. Edgal said the command was not oblivious of the fact that campaigns and political rallies ahead of the 2019 polls had begun and that unscrupulous politicians might want to recruit cultists to foment trouble. The command has arrested 1,000 suspected cultists this year with over 2,000 others renouncing their membership of various secret socities. Explaining the clampdown on cultists, Edgal said: “Cultism is against our laws. It does not represent anything good. Most cultists engage in crimes, such as armed robbery, prostitution and thuggery.

We cannot let the state become a breeding ground for cultists. That is why we have continued to appeal to parents and guardians to admonish their wards.” The police chief assured politicians that tight security would be provided at all rallies, urging them to notify the police ahead of time for proper deployment. He said: “All that is required of politicians is to inform the police ahead of time about any rally to enable the command provide security to forestall any breach of peace. “Thuggery and violence of any kind will not be tolerated. Politicians and their supporters must play by the rules.”
