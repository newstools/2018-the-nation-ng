The future is not looking bright for campus journalism if the spate of victimisation of student-writers continues, a seasoned media practitioner and The Nation’s Managing Editor (Online), Mr Lekan Otufundurin, expressed the fear during a chat with officials of the National Association of Nigerian Campus Editors (NANCE). The NANCE officials, led by their President, Isaac Omole, visited The Nation’s corporate headquarters in Lagos on a working tour. Otufodunrin stressed the need for media practitioners and accomplished journalists who are products of campus journalism to stand up and defend the rights of young writers on campuses vulnerable to victimisation by management. He said if mainstream journalists speak against ongoing victimisation of campus journalists, the tendency of highhandedness by school authorities would be checked. He added that such measure would help guarantee students’ right to write and expose injustice, maladministration and other negative vices in the tertiary institution environments. Otufundurin advised the managements of tertiary schools to stop the “arbitrary suspension and expulsion” being meted out to student-writers. He admonished campus journalists to abide by the ethical code of journalism when writing on campus issues. Responding, Isaac stated the visit was to learn the rudimentary skills of news editing and other newspaper production activities. Omole expressed delight over the mentorship they received from their host, saying: “This auspicious homage to a veteran journalist has further broadened our horizon. We know now, what it demands to become prolific journalists and editors.”
