Former Super Eagles wing-back, Victor Moses saw 90minutes of action for the first time this season during Chelsea’s 2-1 victory against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup game played yesterday. The Nigerian has been out-of-favour since the arrival of new manager Mauricio Sarri this summer but the Italian decided to hand him a starting shirt in a much changed line-up, having rested the likes of Eden Hazard, Olivier Giroud, N’Golo Kante and Jorginho. Moses led the fight for the Blues as they took the fight to their host but no goals were recorded in the first half. The Reds came on strong after the interval and deservedly took the lead through former Chelsea forward Daniel Sturridge. Chelsea made changes as French World Cup winner, Kante came on for Mateo Kovacic and Hazard replaced Willian. The move paid off as the Blues got an equaliser. Emerson Palmieri pounced on a loose ball inside the Liverpool box after the defence failed to clear Simon Mignolet’s save from Morata’s header. Hazard then produced a magical moment when he collected the ball from nearly 50yards, exchanged passes with a teammate – beat two Reds defenders before unleashing a shot into the bottom corner from 15 yards to make it 2-1 in favour of the Blues. Jurgen Klopp threw on Mohammed Salah as they tried to rescue the game but it was too late as Chelsea held on for a precious win. Both teams will face each other again in the premier league on Saturday.
