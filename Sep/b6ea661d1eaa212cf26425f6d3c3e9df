President Muhammadu Buhari has received assurance from the Joint Venture Partners assigned to construct the 3050 Megawatts Mambilla Hydro-electric Power Plant that processes leading to the start of work will soon be completed. He said this would pave the way for the beginning of the project early next year. At a meeting yesterday in Beijing with Professor Lyu Ze Xiang, the President of CGCC, the construction company, President Buhari asked to be briefed on timeline for the commencement of work, following his successful meeting with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping. Buhari, who likened the Mambilla to China’s Three Gorges Dam, said given the significance of the project to Nigeria’s socio-economic development, there was need for its speedy completion. In a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, Buhari said: “I am very pleased with the concern you have shown for the significance of this project. I would like you to ensure its speedy completion.” Xiang told President Buhari that Nigerian officials and the project consultant would meet in two weeks to address the questions raised by President Xi for more detailed and updated feasibility and sustainability studies. He said a team had already been set up to work on the financing aspect. “We understand the importance of this project to the economic and social well-being of Nigeria. In two weeks, we will sit down with the parties for the economic and sustainability analysis. It will take about four weeks to conclude the update,” Xiang said. According to the lead contractor, “pre-commencement work,” would thereafter begin, dealing with access to site and putting in place the necessary support infrastructure such as power, water and transportation. “Our target is to begin the project early next year,” he told President Buhari before the Nigerian leader’s departure at the conclusion of his six-day official trip to China.
