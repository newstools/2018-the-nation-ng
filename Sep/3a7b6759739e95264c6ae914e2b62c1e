“Please I need advice and this is very urgent as it’ll help me because I’m at a point of confusion right now. I met a man, he was married with a child but separated now, his wife moved out with their child, he told me while he was separated with his wife a lady came into his life. To cut d story short, she moved in with him and they’ve been staying together for two years now but they didn’t get married nor did any introduction of any sort but his family is aware of her, and his family has been putting pressure on him to have kids but she’s unable to conceive as a result of fibroid. So he told me d initial plan was for her to move in pending d time she’s able to get her accommodation then she’ll leave but she has refused to leave ever since she moved in neither is she pregnant, fast forward to when we met. We met and he told me everything about him, his ex-wife and the lady months after we’ve met. Now I’m so confused, he said he just told his best friend about d lady living with him to seek advice on how he can make her leave. According to him, she is not ready to move out cos everyone thought they were already married. This is because they act like they’re married already. He hides me from her, doesn’t want her to know he’s dating someone else which is really confusing since he doesn’t want her. Now the most confusing thing is I think he’s in love with her but wants a child at all cost and couldn’t get it from her, so he’s trying to have a child with me cos he told me his friends said she’ll only move out if he gets another woman pregnant. Please I’m confused I need answers as I’ve already fallen in love with him, he shows so much care and love, he’s been asking to meet my family I’m really confused.”   You can also share your story with us @info@thenationonlineng.net
