The Police on Monday arraigned one Brown Iyke, in a Kado Grade 1 Area Court Abuja, for alleged theft of N6,000. Iyke, who resides at Mpape, a suburb of Abuja, had pleaded not guilty to the two-count charges of causing hurt and theft levelled against him. The prosecutor, Judith Obatomi, told the court that Chinemerenwu Obi, of Utako Village, Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station on Aug. 27. Obatomi said the complainant reported that on that same date, while he was at Utako village, the defendant allegedly stole N6,000 from his pocket and hit him on the right eye where he sustained injury. She said the offence contravened Sections 246 and 288 of the Penal Code. The judge, Alhaji Ahmed Ado, granted bail to the defendant in the sum of N50, 000, with one surety in like sum. Ado said that the surety must be a family man, reliable and residing within the court jurisdiction. He then adjourned the case until Sept. 17, for further hearing.
