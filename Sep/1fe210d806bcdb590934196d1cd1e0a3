The Rafin Gora Bridge along the Kontagora – Makera federal highway in Niger state has been washout due to heavy torrential rain. To this end, the state government has directed the closure of the road and banned heavy duty trucks from passing through the route to avoid further deterioration of the road. However, smaller vehicles have been admitted to use a small portion that has been opened by the side of the bridge. This directive was given by the state Commissioner of works, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe during an assessment of the road. He lamented that most of the washed away roads being experienced in the raining season were federal roads, adding that efforts are being made to ensure that the damaged portion is fixed while efforts towards ensuring lasting solution is being explored. Balarabe bemoaned that this year’s rain season have been the most challenging in the state as it pose a serious threat to roads in the state. The Federal Controller of Works in Niger State, Engineer Iheanacho Felix said work would commence on the collapsed road as soon as the rains subside while he appealed for  patience and support from the communities and government. This would bring to bear the third bridge washed out by rains in the state.
