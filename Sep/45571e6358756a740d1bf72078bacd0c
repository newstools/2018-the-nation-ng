… Seven soldiers injured At least seven suspected Boko Haram Terrorists were Thursday killed and several others injured after the group attacked troops of 145 Battalion at Damasak in Borno State. The troops also recovered two vehicles, an anti-aircraft gun, four AK47 rifles, seven magasines, two hand grenades, a bayonet, 47 rounds of 7.62mm special and 174 rounds of 7.62mm NATO ammunition from the terrorists.  Boko Haram terrorists had invaded the troops’ location at Mobar Local Government Area of the state  on Wednesday night which led to an overnight battle. It was gathered that the criminals had tried to penetrate the location but were met with resistant fire power from the troops which left at least seven of the terrorists dead. However, some soldiers were said to have sustained varying gunshot injuries and were later evacuated by army authorities for proper treatment.  Confirming the incident, army spokesman Texas Chukwu, a Brig.-Gen., the troops inflicted casualties on the terrorists. Chukwu refuted earlier report by an online medium which claimed the terrorists had taken over Damasak, insisting that the troops overran them. He confirmed that seven soldiers were injured during the encounter and had been evacuated to military medical facility for treatment. Chukwu said: “Seven members of the terrorists group were neutralised during the encounter while others fled into the nearby bush. Efforts are on by the troops to get other fleeing members of the group.  “Residents of the area are advised to report any suspicious movements or activities to the law enforcement agents for prompt action.”
