The new Kia ProCeed will be unveiled on September 13, and make its  debut at the 2018 Mondial de l’Auto in Paris on October 2. The car merges stunning design with the space and versatility of a tourer in a five-door shooting brake body. The new ProCeed follows the design blueprint laid down by the 2017 Kia Proceed Concept, and will offer drivers an unparalleled combination of design and versatility. Designed, developed and engineered exclusively for Europe, it represents a unique proposition in the mid-size family car segment.
