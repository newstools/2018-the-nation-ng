TWENTY political parties are  supporting the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate Gboyega Oyetola in today’s supplementary governorship election in Osun State. Addressing a news conference in Osogbo yesterday, the leader of Alliance for Cooperating Political Parties (ACPP), comprising  Advanced Democratic Congress,  National Conscience Party and People for Democratic Change, among others,  Prince Adesoji Masilo, said the coalition was backing Oyetola because of his intelligence and character. Masilo said his African People’s Alliance polled over 2,000 votes at Saturday’s inconclusive poll, adding that over 20 political parties decided to support APC owing to the party’s progressive spirit. According to him, the APC had proved that it is capable of developing the state. He urged members of the coalition to troop out today and cast their votes for the APC. Masilo, who decried the vote buying that characterised last Saturday’s  election, said politicians should desist from such act. He said voters should refrain from selling their votes and ensure that they vote Oyetola.
