Captain of the Super Eagles of Nigeria John Obi Mikel will be in action when Nigeria takes on Libya in back-to-back Africa Cup of Nations Qualifiers according to the coach of the team Gernot Rohr. Most Nigerians feared the worst when the Tianjin Teda midfielder asked to be excused from Nigeria’s game against Seychelles, as it came at a time when his former Chelsea teammate Victor Moses announced his retirement from the team. However, any talks of Mikel retiring from the team has been laid to rest by Rohr, who confirmed that the captain will be in the team for the game against Libya alongside some other players who were absent for the game against Seychelles. “By the 10th of October, we will recover our injured players like (William) Ekong, like Ola Aina, Obi Mikel will be fit also”, the coach said after the game against Seychelles. Meanwhile, former Super Eagles’ star and current head coach of the Tanzania national team, Emmanuel Amuneke, will be the guest of FIFA at this month’s Best Awards after getting an invitation to grace the event in London, AOIFootball.com reports. Amuneke, who recently led Tanzania to an impressive 1-1 draw in Ouagadougou against Uganda in the 2019 AFCON qualifiers and was part of the Technical Committee Study Group at the World Cup in Russia, will also attend a stakeholders meeting on the eve of the ceremony. The meeting is scheduled to be held on September 23rd, a day before the Best Awards and would have in attendance the FIFA President, the Russia 2018 World Cup Technical Study Group members and all national team coaches under FIFA. Amuneke said after his invitation that it was an honour for him to be invited as he continues to work to ensure he contributes his quota to the development of football worldwide.
