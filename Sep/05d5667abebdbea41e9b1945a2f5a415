THE Leadership of Ibadan Zone of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has disowned Dr. Usman Adebimpe Raheem of the University of Ilorin, who is facing allegations of plagiarism and intellectual fraud. The ASUU leadership maintained that its chairperson for the University of Ilorin is Dr. Kayode Afolayan, who was “illegally sacked by the university of Ilorin administration”. The Ibadan Zone of ASUU covers the University of Ilorin, University of Ibadan, Osun State University and Ladoke Akintola University, Ogbomoso. The Nation, on Tuesday, reported that Raheem is facing intellectual fraud and plagiarism case. In a statement, entitled: “Re: Unilorin ASUU chair faces plagiarism crisis: A disclaimer”, issued in Ibadan, ASUU Zonal Chairman Dr. Ade Adejumo and University of Ibadan Chapter Chairman Dr. Deji Omole stated that “for the avoidance of doubt, Dr. Raheem is not known to ASUU and he is not the chairman of ASUU Unilorin Branch”. According to the zonal leadership, Raheem “is an impostor and leader of a renegade group backed by the management of UNILORIN that calls itself ASUU”. Adejumo and Omole stated that the chairperson of UNILORIN branch is Dr. Kayode Niyi Afolayan, whose “illegal termination of appointment and that of the branch secretary, Dr. Solomon Oyelekan, by former VC Prof. Abdulganiyu Ambali, is being contested in court”. “As a union of intellectuals, ASUU does not condone unethical practices and acts of fraud among its members. The union hopes that all the authorities directly concerned and mentioned in the story, especially the University of Ilorin and University of Ibadan, where Dr. Raheem obtained his PhD, that has alleged plagiarised materials, will act immediately on this matter to restore sanity to ethical practices and standards in the academia being eroded by this alleged shameful conduct of Dr. U.A Raheem,” the statement stressed.
