Following the Osun State gubernatorial election which held on Saturday, hip hop artiste David Adeleke who is more known as Davido has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to release the results. Taking to Twitter, Davido wrote: ‘They are planning to declare the election inconclusive as a result of cancellation and violence in some p u bc the margin is too close, PDP must fight this injustice. We must come out to say no to this daylight robbery!!!! @inecigeria.” And munching his tweet, he posted on Instagram, “We no gree !! @inecnigeria ! ANNOUNCE THE PEOPLES CHOICE ! U HAVE RIGGED ENUFF ALREADY AND STILL CANT CATCH UP !! @ademolaadeleke_01 IMOLE DE !” Davido’s uncle, Senator Ademola Adeleke, is contesting the position of governor of the state under the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP and the result which was released on Sunday showed he was neck and neck with the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Gboyega Oyetola. However, INEC later declared the election result inconclusive and have called for a rerun of the election in some polling units.
