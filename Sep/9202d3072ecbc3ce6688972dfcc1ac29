The Police yesterday made clarification on the allowances paid to policemen deployed for election duty in Osun State. Contrary to reports, the Police said the payment made to police was 10 days duty tour allowance, adding that it was done according to Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules. This is contained in a statement issued yesterday in Abuja by the Force Spokesman, Ag. DCP Jimoh Moshood. The statement reads: “The attention of the Nigeria Police Force was drawn to a front page story in the Punch newspaper of today, 19th September, 2018 captioned ‘Osun poll: FG pays constables N50,000.00 each for election duty, others more. allowance more than N45000 monthly salary’ credited to Femi Makinde and Oladimeji Ramon. “The Force wishes to categorically state that the story is absolutely misleading and an outright misinformation which is figments of imagination of the two writers. “The Federal Government did not pay constables N50,000 each for election duty, others more as claimed in the report. “It is imperative and incumbent on the Force to set the record straight and educate the writers of the story that the payment of allowance to Officers and Men of the Force and that of other Security and Safety Agencies complementing the Nigeria Police Force in election security is statutory and transparent in line with the Financial Regulations and Public Service Rules as it has to do with Duty Tour Allowance.” Giving breakdown of the allowance, the Police said: “To further disabuse the minds of members of the public who must have read the report and correct the mischief by the writers of the story, the following is the breakdown of the Duty Tour Allowance (DTA) entitlements paid to Police Officers and Men deployed for election duty in Osun State and other previous governorship elections held in Edo, Ondo, Anambra and Ekiti States. “Ranks and File (Constable to Sergeant) – N5,000 DTA per Day X 10 Days = N50,000; Inspector to Chief Superintendent of Police – N12,000 DTA per Day X 10 Days = N120,000;  Assistant Commissioner of Police – Assistant Inspector General of Police – N16,000 DTA per Day X 10 Days = N160,000 and “Deputy Inspector General of Police – N20,000 DTA per Day X 10 Days = N200,000.
