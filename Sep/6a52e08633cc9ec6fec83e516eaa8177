The police in Lagos have arrested 11 suspected members of a cult group, New Black Movement of Africa. Godwin Victor, Benjamin Daniel, Saviour Anioffiong, Lawal Ibrahim, Shola Odekunle, Sodiq Olawuyi, Segun Fagbohun, Bashiru Lawal, Chinedu Francis, Wahab Adams and Ifarinde Adeniyi were arrested at the wee hours of Friday at Jakande Estate, Ajah, where they were allegedly terrorising residents. It was gathered that the suspects had gone to the area in search of a young man who fled their initiation ground. The unnamed young man, it was gathered, could not withstand the torture and other initiation procedures of the group, which made he flee. Afraid that he would give them away, the suspects were said to have gone to his neighbourhood, beating and robbing people. According to spokesman for the command, Chike Oti, the escapee’s mother sneaked out of the house and alerted the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Ilasan, Onyinye Onwuamaegbu, a Chief Superintendent (CSP). Oti said: “The DPO led a contingent of policemen to the estate and arrested eleven members of the group. The police team recovered a locally made shotgun, four live cartridges, three cutlasses, one sledge hammer, ten horse whips and assorted charms.  “In a related development, two notorious cultists, Rasheed Yusuf aka Radical and Abel Okwo were arrested during a supremacy battle between the Aiye and Eiye confraternities at Akerele Street, Oworonshoki. “The said Abel Okwo was charged to court two months ago by the command for cult related offences only to come back to terrorise the town again. “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Imohimi Edgal has vowed the Command will not relent in its efforts at ridding the state of members of these unlawful societies. “He urged parents to hold heart to heart talks with their children, male and female alike, on the consequences of belonging to cult groups.”
