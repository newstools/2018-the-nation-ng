The APC has faulted the foul cry by the PDP over the outcome of the election as unjustified. In a statement by its spokesperson in Osun State Mr. Kunle Oyatomi, the APC said the PDP was “unable to manipulate the result this time around, so they are crying foul.” He added: “We have always known and have made ourselves clear before the election that the PDP had made elaborate arrangement to rig the election through the manipulation of the card readers and it was this process that made them got the votes, allocated to them in the first ballot. “Nobody expected the PDP to even come second. Most people in Osun had believed that it would be a straight fight between the APC and SDP. But as God would have it, Osun was saved from the vultures. “We like Osun people to understand that the run off votes went that way because the PDP was unable to manipulate the card readers this time around and fortunately the police thwarted their plot of buying and trying to use the PVCs of suspecting  voters. That is why some of their leaders were arrested. So the PDP should look for other excuses.”
