The senator representing Ondo North senatorial district, Prof Ajayi Boroffice, yesterday escaped assassination in Owo, headquarters of Owo Local Government Area of the state. The Special Assistant to the senator, Kayode Fakuyi, confirmed the attack, alleging that the suspected assailants were political thugs. He said: “In continuation of political campaign across the 72 wards of Ondo North senatorial district, Senator Ajayi Boroffice visited Owo on Saturday. “The venue of the campaign, Raheem’s Hall, was attacked by armed thugs. The assailants freely unleashed ranging degrees and forms of violence on the people who gathered at the venue. “Evidently, it was a clear assassination attempt. The senator escaped the assassination attempt by providence. However the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, Segun Ajiboye, described the allegation as wicked, wondering how people should frame such blatant lie because of politics. He cautioned Boroffice’s group against raising unnecessary tension in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections. Ajiboye asked the group to mention those behind the assassination attempt “if such frivolous allegation was true.” But the state police command denied knowledge of the incident. It said the matter was not reported in any police station in the state. The Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) for the state command, Femi Joseph said the police were not aware of the incident, going by the records with all the Police posts in the state. He warned politicians against violence in the state, urging them to play the games according to the rule ahead of the 2019 polls.
