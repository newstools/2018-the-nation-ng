Members of the reformed All Progressives Congress (r-APC) in Edo State have defected to the People’s Democratic Party. Many of the Edo r-APC defectors were supporters of Kwankwassyia movement in the state. They adorned the famous red cap of the movement as they marched through the streets of Bénin City to the state secretariat of the PDP. The defectors were former members of the PDP who joined the now defunct ruling ACN in 2012 during the administration of Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. They described their return as home coming. Chief Osamede Adun, the Aiyobahan of Bénin Kingdom, who led the defectors, said he has remained with the PDP in soul even though he was a member of the APC. Adun said he was first forced to leave the PDP because the threat to his business interest by the state government. He however said he was not worried if more taxes were imposed on him because he and his supporters are determined to rout out the APC. Chief Adun promised that his supporters would not contest any position in the forth coming elections but that they hoped their demands would be met when it’s time for sharing after electoral victory. State Chairman of the PDP, Chief Dan Orbih, who gave the party’s membership cards to the defectors, said the Edo APC led by Godwin Obaseki is now experiencing ‘political Ebola.’ Chief Orbih condemned what he termed frequent overseas trip by Governor Obaseki saying the solutions to the state problems were not in abroad. Orbih urged Governor Obaseki to remain at home instead of traveling to different parts of the world to find solutions to problems in the state. He said the defections were a sign that the Edo APC is weak and has failed to deliver on electoral promises. He accused Governor Obaseki of abandoning Edo people and bringing people that are unknown to Edo politics to dominate affairs of the state. Special Adviser to Governor Obaseki on Media and Communication Strategy, Mr. Crusoe Osagie, could not be reached for comments.
