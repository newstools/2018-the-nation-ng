Super Eagles’ goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho has stated that the tie against South Africa would be a tough match, the match will be played on the 16th of November in Johannesburg. Uzoho told Brila FM yesterday that the match would be a tough one due to the way the South Africans played Eagles last time in a 2-0 win. “I have never underrated any team because whenever I come against any team I try to do my best, the game against South Africa would not be an easy nut to crack,” said Uzoho. He went further to say that the match against Libya was difficult due to the weather climate and pitch size. He said the pitch was smaller than the one in Uyo and that made the game looked like a cage match. “I think the game was very difficult than it was in Uyo due to the weather change and also the pitch size which looked smaller than the one in Uyo, we had more space to run around the opponent in Uyo but in Tunisia, it was more like a cage.” Speaking further, Uzoho appreciated the effort of the fans for their support all through the match and promised to improve in his keeping skills. “I really want to say thank you to the fans because their support has been very helpful for me and also the team. I am having fun at my goal post now with communicating better with my defenders which makes my work easier now. I am always eager to play all the time but it is all in the hands of the Coach,” Uzoho said.
