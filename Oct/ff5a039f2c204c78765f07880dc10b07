FORMER Inspiration FM on air personality, Collins Teke, who recently joined Cool FM/Nigeria Info Lagos, has disclosed that he has found a new family and he is happy at the radio station just days after pitching his tent in Lagos. The popular OAP and voice over artist who is famous for his ‘Breakfast Jam’ radio programme on Inspiration FM Ibadan had resigned at the station to focus on his ‘Blackvoice Media’. Teke, who has been in the broadcasting industry for over a decade, now hosts ‘The Lunch Time Magazine’, an entertainment show that airs every weekday (12-3pm) Nigeria Info 99.3fm Lagos. Speaking on his short hiatus on radio, he said: ‘It is about six months since I resigned from Inspiration FM to focus on my brand, ‘Blackvoice Media’. Now I feel and know the time is ripe to go back on  air’,” he said. ‘Life is a journey full of adventures, ambitions, dreams and aspirations made more interesting by the mountain tops and bottom valley experiences,  but, one thing that  has remained common and constant is movement… progress… at some point in life one has to make some necessary adjustments and movement either to adapt to the evolving changes around or to aid changes- a drive to explore and conquer more grounds. ‘In my broadcasting sojourn of over a decade, I have learnt a whole lot. Although,  there had been ups and downs, times of uncertainties and high expectations …  there had also been cherishable times of explosions of joy, hope and faith…. I have learnt and unlearned… Several times I have been tested, stretched and …..twisted, that made me always want to give a little more and  do a little more…. That spirit and experience has made me a better man and a better broadcaster and I owe it all to my friends and colleagues in the profession.’
