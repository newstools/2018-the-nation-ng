Students of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka ( UNN ) have lamented the difficulty in accessing the school’s portal for accommodation. Some of the students who spoke in an interview said they were not able to generate hostel invoice. “We were asked to log in to the school portal to generate hostel invoice on Tuesday 23rd October,2018 for returning students, while the new students were expected to do the same on Monday, 22nd October,2018. “ However, some of the first year students were lucky to get a bed space while some were unlucky.” A newly admitted student who pleaded anonymity said ” the reason I was unable to get a bed space was due to the fact that the site was clogged up and it kept on saying server too busy. “I just hope that since the school has said that we have 40% chances of getting a bed space that the portal will be reopened for first years”. Since Tuesday, majority of the other students have found it difficult to access the website thereby leaving them only with the option of seeking accommodation off campus as academic activities are soon to kick off. A 300 level student also narrated her ordeal of the same situation said that “I have not been able to generate my hostel invoice since on Tuesday. ” I have had sleepless night for two days just for the sake of this issue but it has proved abortive”. Another student also recalled that ” there was a similar issue last year which led to majority of the student staying off campus.” A final year student added that ” the only reason I still insist on getting a bed space is due to the benefits that comes with it”. “Altogether, the site is a total scam and the school should please do something about the site as I cannot see myself joggling with accommodation and project work”.
