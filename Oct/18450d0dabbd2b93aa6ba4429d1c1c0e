An army of policemen yesterday surrounded Lagos Airport Hotel, Ikeja. It is not immediately clear why they were there, but a source said their presence might not be unconnected with the primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and Jide Sanwo-Olu are in the race for the ticket. ”We suspect that the buses are moving in ballot boxes,” the source said. The Nation could not confirm the allegation.
