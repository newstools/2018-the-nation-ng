The Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Achebe, and other traditional rulers in Anambra State have pledged their support towards the eradication of the “Osu” caste system. The monarchs made their position known yesterday in Awka at a consultative meeting with a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), the Initiative for the Eradication of Traditional and Cultural Stigmatisation in our Society (IFETACSIOS). Achebe, who chairs the Anambra Traditional Council Rulers, lauded the group for its commitment in promoting social harmony among Igbo communities. He, however, urged traditional rulers in the state to be open for further engagement with the group on the issue whenever they visited. President of IFETACSIOS Ms. Oge Maduagwu solicited for the monarchs’ support in advancing the cause for the abolition of the Osu caste system in the state. She said: “Abolishing the ‘osu, ohu, ume, and diala’ caste system would restore the dignity of human being, promote peaceful relationship, reduce communal conflicts, among others. “In Igbo land, it is very sad to note that a young man and young lady might be courting but the moment it is discovered that either of them is an osu, the relationship ends.” Maduagwu hinted that the abolition advocacy had been launched in Imo and Enugu States, with plans to visit Ebonyi and Abia States before the end of 2018. “The big dream of IFETACSIOS is the coming together of all the Eastern states of Imo, Ebonyi, Anambra, Enugu and Abia to sign an accord on the abolition of osu, ohu, ume and diala one day,” she added.
