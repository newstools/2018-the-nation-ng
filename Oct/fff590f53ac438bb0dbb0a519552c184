The Abuja International Motor Fair will hold at the Eagle Square, Abuja from October 21  to 27. According to the Organising Committee Chairman, Ifeanyichukwu Agwu, the 19th edition event, is targeted at boosting investments in the sector. “Despite the myriads of challenges confronting the sector as well as the Nigerian economy in general, the automobile industry is assuming its rightful place as key sector that drives socio-economic development,” he said. Agwu, who is also the BKG Exhibitions Limited Managing Director, said this year’s edition has been packaged to address the current challenges in the sector so as to use it to drive the nation’s economic diversification policy. He said: “We are packaging a show that will showcase all the existing and potential investment opportunities that abound in the automotive industry, which we believe are very attractive to existing and prospective investors. “The quality and quantity of showcased automobiles are undoubtedly the primary yardstick of measuring the success of any auto exhibition. This means that auto enterprises showcasing at any exhibition must ensure visibility, wholeness and completeness, not leaving anything to chance. “With our reach, high powered delegations from the government as well, lots of corporate heads and organisations across the nation have been invited to grace the event.”
