It was a good start for CAMAC of Yenagoa in group B as they got their total NBBF National Final opener to a winning start with a 73point victory over Bukavu Blinks of Kano. Benedict Onuvughakpo with 11points, 1 assist and 14 rebounds was the star for his team as they coasted home to victory in a game they largely dominated. George Akuba came off the bench to help his team with 15points while the duo of Amos Gbonwei and Lucky Reuben scored 10 points each. Despite the 14 points scored by Yahaya Abdulkareem, it was not enough in a game where the team’s inability to put their shots away condemned them to an opening day defeat. In the second Group B game, it was an exciting battle between 2 equally matched teams when Prison Reformers took on Golden Touch. It took the brilliance of Mohammed Musa who scored 20 points and weighed in with 3 assists to hand Golden Torch a 59 to 55 point win in the dying minutes of the game. Adie Nazareth also assisted his team with 14points, 1 steal and 4 rebounds. Golden Touch’s Head Coach, Huzi Mshelia praised the efforts of his team as he traced their win to resilience. “It was a very difficult game, but our boys held their grounds to grind out a win.” According to Mshelia, the first game is always crappy, so such result was expected. In the third game, Taraba’s Hurricane lost by just a point to Ondo Kings from Akure as the match ended 57 to 58points. The Total National Final 8 continues on Wednesday with matches in Group A. Prison Reformers will tackle Coal City while Golden Touch face Brave Hearts. In group B, Ondo Kings are up against Bukavu Blings as Taraba Hurricanes battle CAMAC.
