Three women, who were abducted by four kidnappers, have narrated how they were tortured to pay ransom before they were released. The women were kidnapped at spots in Benin City, Edo State by the gang, who posed as commercial bus driver and passengers. One of the victims, who gave her name as Faith, said she boarded a bus to Sapele Road while going home, but she didn’t know that the driver and passengers were kidnappers. She said she was blindfolded and taken to an unknown place where she was tortured and raped. The woman said her abductors demanded N5million from her parents as ransom, adding that N300,000 was withdrawn from her account. On how she recognised the suspects, she said they didn’t wear masks on the day they dropped her after spending three nights with them. Another victim, Princess Eweka, said she was going home and was on Ekenwan Road when a bus stopped and she was dragged inside. She said a male passenger was beaten up and thrown out of the bus. Eweka said she was tortured and beaten up, after which her parents paid N500,000 ransom. She said she recognised the suspects because they did not wear masks. The third victim, who gave her name as Blessing, said the kidnappers snatched her N400,000. She said she was abducted on Airport Road and taken to an unknown spot. Blessing said she refused to eat while in the kidnappers’ den for four days. Police Commissioner Babatunde Kokumo paraded the suspects, namely Ikechukwu Emmanuel, Friday Ihaza, Godspower Ezemene and Okonofua Friday. He said the command bust the gang following intelligence report, adding that they would soon be arraigned. The suspects said they resorted to kidnapping because of hunger.
