One man who believes the return of the National Sports Commission (NSC) will restore the fortunes of sports in Nigeria, is the former governor of Delta state, Dr Emmanuel Uduaghan. The ex-governor who was one of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) patrons, formally invested on Tuesday, also re-emphasised the need to focus on grassroots sports development across the country. The chief host of the colourful investiture ceremony, Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi, another patron, also pledged his support to sports in the country. In a statement signed by the royal father’s spokesman, Tope Oyefeso, Elegushi noted that sports remain a major unifying factor for Nigerians and it is vital; for it to enjoy the support of all well-meaning individuals. “Until we return the NSC where the commission will be manned by professionals, our sports will continue to suffer. I don’t have anything against the Minster of Sports but my major concern is that sports should not be at the behest of the Ministry but the NSC, where professionals are assigned to manage the affairs,” Uduaghan said. The former Commissioner for Health, however, charged those in charge of sports not to neglect grassroots sports as this remains the bedrock of any sporting nation. Elegushi lauded the NOC for the honour while stating that he accepted to serve as a Patron of the Olympic movement in Nigeria, in view of the strategic role sports, play in our socio-economic development, adding that it was time for everyone to support the government in moving sports forward, as this can no longer be the business of government alone. The monarch, however, reiterated that sports as a rallying point of the people, regardless of language or origin, deserves more attention from the citizens, especially the privileged, whom he admonished to use their resources to promote sports, nurture new talents, which he opined would help to improve peaceful co-existence in the country.
