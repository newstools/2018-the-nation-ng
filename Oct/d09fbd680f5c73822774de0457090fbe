Residents of Eti-Osa and members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the weekend  protested what they termed “short-changing of a popular aspirant” in the area. Under the aegis of Humble Prince Campaign Organisation, they urged APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to intervene. The protesters, led by Chief Rilwan Aleshinloye, said a  House of Representatives member, Jide Akinloye a.k.a. Humble Prince, won the Eti-Osa Federal Constituency primary election on October 4. According to Aleshinloye, the returning officer, Dr Tola Kasali and the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), who observed the election, affirmed the victory of Akinloye. The group urged APC National Working Committee (NWC) to uphold the result signed by Kasali. Aleshinloye allayed the fear of the gathering on the outcome of the election. “The primary election was conducted in accordance with the party’s guidelines and it was free, fair and credible. We congratulate ourselves and Akinloye on his victory in the election. His experience and contributions to the development of Eti-Osa were major reasons for his victory,” he said. Former Eti-Osa East Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chairman Alhaji Owolabi Yisa appealed to Asiwaju Tinubu to ensure justice is done. “Our national leader is a true democrat, a leader who always stands for truth and justice, the hope for the hopeless, on your mandate we stand. We believe he will do justice to the issue at hand. We appeal to our members not to relent in supporting Akinloye, President Muhammadu Buhari, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Senator Oluremi Tinubu and Assembly members,” he said. The group promised President Buhari and Sanwo-Olu three million votes each during next year’s general election.
