A 20-year-old woman, Amina Hassan, yesterday took her father, Hassan Adamu, to a Sharia Court in Magajin Gari, Kaduna for his refusal to allow her marry the man she loves. The woman, who lives with her grandmother on Bashama Road, Tudun Wada, Kaduna said through her lawyer, Ado Ali that she wanted the court to order her father to marry her off to her heartthrob. The complainant added that she had attained marriage age and would want to settle with the man she loved, but her father refused his assent. “We want the court to order her father to marry her off to her heartthrob,” her lawyer said. He said if the father remained adamant, the court should serve as the woman’s guardian and marry her off to the man she loved. Ali said he had made attempts to convince the father to change his mind, but to no avail. He said the father withheld his blessings because the  suitor had no regard for him. The counsel, however, prayed the court to grant the two parties two weeks “to sort things out and reach an agreement.” The defendant’s counsel, Nasir Abdullahi, agreed with the submission of the prosecution counsel that the court should give them time to resolve the issue. The Judge, Malam Dahiru Lawal, noted that although the father had a right to assess his daughter’s suitors, he had no right to force anyone on her. He, therefore, ordered the defendant’s lawyer to present the father in court on October 29, for further hearing.
