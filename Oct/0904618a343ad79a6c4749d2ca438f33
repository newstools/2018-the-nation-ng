There was massive turnout of card- carrying members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) across the 305 Wards of Imo State yesterday during the governorship primary. Voting commenced across the Wards as early as 10 am. The exercise followed cancellation of the results of the Ahmed Gulak- led Committee, which produced two candidates after the chairman absconded. The new Committee is led by Ibrahim Agbabiaka. There was tight security at the venues of the congresses all over the state. Results at most of the Wards visited by our correspondent, who monitored the exercise, showed UcheNwosu, who is Governor RochasOkorochaâ€™s preferred aspirant, was in comfortable lead. Deputy Governor Eze Madumere and Senator Hope Uzodinma reportedly boycotted the exercise. Madumere, in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Uche Onwuchekwa, said he will not be part of the exercise because it has been concluded.
