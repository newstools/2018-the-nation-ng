Known for his vocal attributes, son of late Afrobeat founder, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti has thrown a jibe at most artistes who claim to be sharing his late father’s philosophies. According to the Seun, most artistes prefer the convenient aspects of his late father’s life, hence, he says everyone wants to be Fela because they want to smoke weed and chase women without attempting the kind of sacrifices he made. Seun made this assertion on Instagram, on Monday, October 15, 2018. He said: “People will never understand you without going through the education you have tried to promote. Every Tom Dick and Ashy is the new Fela just because they want to smoke igbo and chase women. How about the sacrifice? How about duty? They want to be Fela and at the same time be the darlings of all the oppressors. All these new Fela’s and those possessed by his spirit hobnobbing with white supremacists. “They think you are great because rappers mention your name, they don’t know that rappers mention your name so they can feel greatness. What do they know about sacrifice? What do they know about the trauma that first-hand violence has inflicted on our family? The blind leading the blind listening to the deaf speak! Happy 80th. The struggle intensifies!!!” Recently, Seun censured a claim by American singer Kanye West who made reference to Fela and other legendary musicians in a video, saying the spirit of Fela, Bob Marley, and 2Pac flows in him. “Erm erm on behalf of the Kuti family, I want to state that the spirit of Olufela Anikulapo Kuti isn’t anywhere near Kanye West. @ziggymarley over to you. @oldmanebro come get ur boi before I #getthesax,” Seun wrote.
