The police have arrested a Togolese, Dominic Samson, 31, for allegedly sleeping with underage girls. He was said to have given them N50 each after the exercise. Samson was arrested last Monday around 8:50am by Ejigbo Police Station Divisional Police Officer Olabisi Okufowobi, a Chief Superintendent (CSP) following a complaint by the father of one his victims, a 15-year-old girl. According to a statement issued on Monday by Police spokesman, Chike Oti, a CSP, Samson was caught sleeping with the 15-year-old girl by neighbours at their 28 Olusesan Street, Ejigbo home. The neighbours informed the girl’s father, who had gone out to his place of work. The man reported the matter to Ejigbo Police Station Oti said: “Based on his complaint, the DPO, a female officer, interrogated the victim and she confirmed the report. She confirmed that the suspect did not only defile her but sodomised her by having anal sexual intercourse with her. She further revealed that she was not the only victim of the suspect’s indecent sexual behaviour . She named five other victims who are within 13 to 15 years age bracket. “All the victim’s except the sixth had been identified, interrogated and their statements recorded. The girls said the suspect sometimes bring all of them together in one room for an orgy and thereafter give them a cash reward of N50 each.” According to him, the victims had been taken to the Mirabel Centre where the doctor’s report confirmed that the victims were indeed defiled as alleged. The Commissioner of Police (CP) Imohimi Edgal, Oti said, urged parents to be mindful of their children as that is the only panacea to the rising cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of children.
