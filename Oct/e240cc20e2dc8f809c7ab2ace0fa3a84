AS a result of growing insecurity in Borno State, occasioned by increased attacks by Boko Haram insurgents, the 2018 Batch ‘C’ National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members deployed to serve in the state have been relocated to Katsina State where they began their three-week orientation course on Thursday. Speaking at their swearing-in ceremony at the temporary camp located within the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) Training College in Katsina, the Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima, noted that their relocation was due to the temporary security situation in his state, urging the corps members to re-dedicate themselves to nation building. Shettima, who was represented by the State Chairman, NYSC Governing Board, Mahdi Gazali, however said “The government and good people of Borno State are doing everything humanly possible through our programme of reconstruction and rehabilitation to return the state to the pedestal of peace, security and development it has been known for before the insurgency problem that nearly crippled the socio-economic life of the state’’. “I therefore wish to assure you of your safety during the three weeks orientation exercise and the service ahead. It behoves you to be part of the problem solving team by expressing your potentials through rendering honest and dedicated services to your host communities’’. “I urge you to summon courage to come and stay in Borno and you will understand the fact that the security situation of the state is not bad as it is being propagated by some media,” he said. Speaking earlier, the Borno State NYSC Coordinator, Rabiu Aminu, said 1,350 corps members were posted to the state and enjoined them to exhibit high level of respect and discipline, adding that the camping period is filled with vigorous activities which need active participation.
