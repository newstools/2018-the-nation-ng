The Diocesan Bishop of the Diocese of Lagos (Anglican Communion), Rt. Rev. Humphrey Olumakaiye, has urged the country’s leaders to do more by creating employment for the youths. Speaking at a service held by the Church of Resurrection, Victoria Island, Lagos, last weekend, the cleric said youths are the future leaders. Olumakaiye, therefore, urged wealthy Nigerians to help empower the youths, adding that government cannot do it alone. His words: “There is need for us to be passionate about youth development, because we believe that many of our youths are neglected, and are not brought up properly. “We believe that oil, gas and agriculture are not the greatest resources of a nation; the youths are the greatest resources for the development of a great nation. “We believe that they are the future of our great nation. In actual fact, they are the posterity; they are the hope of our future in this country. “We believe that it will be proper for us to have a holistic approach to youth development. If we do that we are actually building great leaders. The Brand Manager, Emzor Pharmaceutical, Mr. Olugbenga Obaparusi, urged the government and the church to intensify efforts at creating employment for youths. “We need to intensify our efforts on youth empowerment and development. The rate of unemployment is alarming and an idle mind is the devil’s workshop. “The government and the church should create employment for the youths. If they are empowered and engaged, the rate of drug abuse will be minimised, if not eradicated,” he said.
