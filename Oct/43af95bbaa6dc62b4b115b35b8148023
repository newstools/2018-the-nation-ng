President Muhammadu Buhari has condemned the recent violence in Jos, Plateau State which led to the imposition of curfew in the state capital. Buhari, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, also appealed to various communities to embrace peace, stressing that peace has no alternative. He said, “I am deeply worried about the seeming indifference to the sanctity of life by criminals whose hearts are hardened by evil.” The President recalled that through the last three and a half years of the present administration in the state, the government has worked very hard with various communities, which clearly demonstrated that a lasting peace can be achieved. He said, “I know it is not an easy thing. It is a very difficult thing. But the resultant peace achieved by the people of Plateau state should not be squandered. Every citizen deserves stability and development. Peace has no alternative. “It is my appeal to all the communities in the state capital, and the entire state as a whole to embrace peace. “Where there are differences, dialogue should be used to bring about understanding. There is also the due process of the law. Differences cannot be resolved by abuses or by bullets.” he said The President also lamented that some politicians were promoting ethnic and religious prejudices for cheap popularity, despite the knowledge that such incitement could play into the hands of hate mongers. He said his administration would continue to engage with stakeholders to address the root causes of the repeated violence in Plateau State and other parts of the country. He also warned that no responsible government would allow anarchy to replace law and order.
