THE family of late Moses Adejumo, popularly known as Baba Sala, has warned unsuspecting members of the public against falling for the tricks of some fraudsters who have opened an online account for the funeral of the late comedian. The eldest son of the comedian, Bamidele Adejumo, who spoke in Ilesa, Osun State on Tuesday, noted that the family had not opened any bank account for the funeral of his father, contrary to claims by the fraudsters. Bamidele said the family was embarrassed that some person had opened a fake bank account to soliciting funds from unsuspecting members of the public. He said: ”We have not opened any PayPal account. The information is false. The family has not asked for anything from anybody. ”We have not met and nobody is soliciting anything from anybody yet. If we will be expecting anything from any fans, admirers or any body and at all, it will be free donation.”
