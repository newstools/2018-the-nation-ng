Students of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife have called on the management of the institution to resolve the transportation crisis on the campus. They made the call in separate interviews over the lack of enough buses for transportation within the campus. A student, Tolu Adams said ” the transportation crisis has not yet been resolved despite the promises made by the school management. The management shouldn’t make vain promises when they know they can’t achieve anything as regards the issue. ” I miss some of my lectures sometimes when there are not enough buses that can convey me from campus. I had to miss a test last semester due to this same transport issue” he said. Timothy Adedeji who spoke with our correspondent expressed displeasure on the transportation crisis which has been a major issue in the campus. “The school management should be able to put everything in place when they know their plans. The school has no plans for over 80% of students who stay in town. I almost missed my exam last semester because of this same issue and the management hasn’t done anything yet to curb this” “Is it because there is no student union on campus that is why the management is doing all this? The management should be after the welfare of the students and not to make the students suffer” he added Kemi Adagunodo pleaded with the management to take a drastic step as regards this transport issue. ” If the school management can’t do anything to this issue then more hostels should be built on campus, so students can have access to stay on campus” “They should be able to look into this before the new intakes come in before everything gets out of hand ‘ she advised.
