THE International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has so far rescued 9,888 Nigerians, it was learnt yesterday. IMO said they were voluntarily returned from different parts of the world and most recently, Libya. IOM Chief-of-Mission Frantz Celestin gave the figure during his visit to the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons (NAPTIP) Headquarters in Abuja. Nneka Aniagoh of NAPTIP Press and Public Relations Unit quoted Celestin as promising increased collaboration with NAPTIP, especially assistance to the returnees, who are victims of human trafficking. Aniagoh said: “Mr. Celestin, who came in the company of Saskia Kok and Elizabeth Poage, both from IOM, informed the Director-General of NAPTIP, Dame Julie Okah-Donli, that the visit was part of his familiarisation meetings with relevant partners and stakeholders tasked with curbing irregular migration and human trafficking in Nigeria.”
