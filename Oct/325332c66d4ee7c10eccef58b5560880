The French Ligue 1 will resume from the international break on Friday, but Thierry Henry’s start of his reign as AS Monaco coach will be the major talking point. Henry who begins with a trip to Strasbourg on Saturday faces a big task to revive the club where he started his glittering playing career. Monaco, French champions and UEFA Champions League semi-finalists in 2017, are languishing 18th in the 20-team standings after winning one of their first nine games. “This club will always have a big place in my heart,” Henry told reporters on Wednesday. “So, to be able to come here and start again, it is a dream come true. “There is a lot of work to do, as you can imagine — but I am more than happy to be here.” The 41-year-old replaced Portuguese Leonardo Jardim who was sacked less than six months after leading Monaco to second place in the standings following their first league title since 2000. Henry was assistant coach of the Belgium team who finished third at this year’s World Cup after losing to France in the semi-finals. Forward Kylian Mbappe, who started his career at Monaco, will be back in action for champions Paris St Germain (PSG) at home to Amiens on Saturday. He scored a late penalty kick to earn France a 2-2 draw with Iceland and helped them beat Germany 2-1. PSG have won their first nine league games of the season and lead the standings by eight points from Lille who travel to Dijon on Saturday. Sixth-placed Olympique Lyonnais host Nimes on Friday and Nice entertain local rivals Olympique de Marseille, third in the standings, on Sunday.
