The Army team on Search and Rescue Operations for the missing Maj.-Gen. Idris Alkali (rtd) has recovered another vehicle from the mining pond in Dura-Du area of Jos South Local Government of Plateau State. The white Toyota Hiace (RYM 307 XA) and its driver allegedly went missing three months ago. Commander of Operation Safe Haven (OPSH) Maj.-Gen. Augustine Agundu, who addressed reporters yesterday at the pond site, said: “The local divers confirmed that three more cars are inside the pond, and we will remove them one after the other. “It is a sad moment for us, for any right thinking Nigerian to think that crime is being committed almost daily. It took the efforts of the joint operation to make the discoveries.” General Officer Commanding (GOC) 3 Division, Rukuba, Maj.-Gen. Benson Akinruluyo, said the Army experienced technical challenges in the operation. He, however, allayed fears that the communities would be dealt with after the discoveries. “There is no need for them to fear. We have recovered the vehicle but we still need to find his body. We were asked to find him dead or alive. The community can tell us where they kept him or his body; we will not stop until we find him or his body,” Akinruluyo said. Gen. Alkali was declared missing on September 3. He was on his way to Bauchi State. The search and rescue team last Saturday recovered a Toyota Corolla (MUN 670 AA), and Gen. Akinroluyo confirmed it belonged to Gen. Alkali.
