A 34-year-old man, Omorodion Samson, has been arrested by the Edo Police Command for allegedly stabbing his half- brother, Imuetiyan, to death. The incident reportedly occurred at 3, Blessed Quarters, Egba in Ikpoba-Okha Local Government. Omorodion, according to the police, allegedly stabbed his brother in the neck with a knife after an argument. Speaking to reporters when he was paraded at the police headquarters, Omorodion denied being responsible for his brother’s death. He said he was framed up by his elder brother, whom he quarrelled with over a building their late mother left behind. Omorodion claimed he built the house for their mother when he was abroad, but his elder brother wanted to take everything. He said: “My elder brother and I have been quarrelling over a house I built for my mother when I was in Italy. My brother drove me away from the house. That was why he accused me of killing my half-brother. “I went into wheel barrow pushing at New Benin Market after he drove me out of the house. I only asked for my share of the house. He didn’t want to give me my share. I was deported in 2012. I couldn’t go back again. I was not at home when my brother died.” Police Commissioner Babatunde Kokumo said the suspect would be arraigned after investigation.
