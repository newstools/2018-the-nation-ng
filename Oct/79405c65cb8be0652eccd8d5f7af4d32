Elected All Progressives Congress (APC) councillors in Ogun State yesterday declared the support for the party’s governorship candidate, Prince Dapo Abiodun. The 276 councillors spoke at the Dapo Abiodun Campaign Office in Iperu- Remo, in solidarity with the candidate. They said their support for him is in line with the decision of the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). The councillors said the party’s decision is “supreme”. According to them, since the NWC had taken a “final decision” in affirming and ratifying Abiodun’s candidature, no protests can alter the “mandate”. One of them, Adewale Aka, who addressed his colleagues, called for concerted efforts to ensure victory for Abiodun in 2019. Aka hailed Governor Ibikunle Amosun for his achievements in the last seven and a half years. The councillor pledged that the same support accorded Amosun would be extended to Abiodun when he is elected governor next year. He pleaded with the governor to support Abiodun and the party to win the governorship poll. Aka said: “We beg him (Amosun); he is our leader. He supported the party, he helped to build the party with other leaders. He should embrace Abiodun, support him and the party to win the 2019 governorship election in Ogun State.” Another councillor, Taiwo Abiodun, from Abeokuta South, said APC’s decision is supreme. He urged all to embrace the decision of the NWC on Abiodun’s candidacy. Somefun Olajunwon, from Ilisan in Ogun East, said Abiodun had offered much assistance to the APC in Ogun state and deserves the support of every member to realise the governorship ambition in 2019. He said: “The party is supreme. Since Dapo Abiodun has become the party’s candidate, the governor should join hands with him to move the state forward. We stand by the decision of the NWC. There should be no bitterness about that and we should strive to go into the election next year strong and united.”
