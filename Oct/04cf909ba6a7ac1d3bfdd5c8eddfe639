Our aim is to reach and sustain 100 percent shortly. “As further gains from our civil service and pensions reforms, we started paying state civil servants 100 percent of their salaries over the last couple of months. “While that is ongoing, we intend to pay off all arrears due to cleared workers soon, maybe as soon as this month.” He disclosed that the government concluded the audit of the state pension administration covering a period of five years preceding his government.
