NOTABLE fashion and luxury brand, 2207bytbally, owned by celebrity designer, Tolu Bally, will be celebrating its second anniversary with pop up sales and party. Slated for November 18, 2018 at Sidewalk Restaurant, Victoria Island, Lagos, the event, is expected to make available ready-to-wear outfits, designs and materials at affordable rates to loyal customers, celebrities and prospective ones. Bally says the pop up sale will be done in an atmosphere of fun and party where everyone, both celebrities and regular folk can party and buy items from the brand. In less than two years, the fashion brand is known to have styled many Nigerian celebrities such as Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, Bolanle Olukanni, Ini Edo, Toyin Abraham, Linda Osifo, Inidinma Okojie, Lilian Afegbai, Beverly Naya and many more. The brand has serviced not just celebrities but working class women and top executives. Her statement on celebrities have been adjudged a must have in many circles. Speaking on the event, Bally says: “I just want to use the medium to thank everyone who has supported the brand either through sales, through referrals and through promotions. It’s been two amazing years and I’m excited for what’s to come. We have decided to have a Pop Up Sale to carry everyone along. It is more than pop up sales but a celebration party for current clients and prospective clients. For long now, our brand 2207bytbally have been associated with celebrities and entertainers with many people believing that we do not have anything for people who aren’t celebrities but this is not accurate. Yes, we have many celebrity clients but we also attend to regular people who want our service. This two years anniversary pop up sale is an opportunity for everyone, celebrity or not to turn up and party while also having the opportunity to buy our products and patronize the 2207byTbally brand they love.”
