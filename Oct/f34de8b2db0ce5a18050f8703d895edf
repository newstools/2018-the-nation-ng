Residents of Olaniyi Street, Daleko, near Ladipo in Mushin have appealed to the Mushin Local Government and Lagos State Government to fix the road. They said it has become a nightmare due to deep potholes. The potholes, the residents said, are causing loss of man-hour to traffic, adding that they also cause accidents. They said vehicles and tricycles (Keke Marwa) got da           maged in the process of removing them whenever they were trapped in the potholes. A resident, Mr. Ola Ogunniyi, said the potholes have been there for over four months. “I don’t remember the exact time the potholes problem started, but I am sure they have been there for over four months. The government has not fixed the road. It is affecting those of us living around here because the tricycle operators (Keke Marwa drivers) sometimes increase the fare because of the gridlock caused by the potholes,” he said. A tricycle operator, Uche Nnamdi, said: “The potholes are so bad that our Marwa (tricycles) fall in them and get spoilt. This affects our business. I hope the government does something about it.” Segun Alao, a commercial motorcyclist, said people usually pulled out cars and tricycles trapped in the potholes. ”The potholes are very deep. Drivers, who do not notice them from far, get stuck in them,” he said.
