…Says 90% APC members happy  The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole, on Monday said that there was no cause for alarm on the speculated moves to remove him from office. He was reacting to reports in the social media of plans by some APC governors to storm Abuja towards gathering signatures to remove him from office. Speaking with State House correspondents after a delegation of APC politicians from Kwara State met President Muhammadu Buhari, Oshiomhole said that only one or two out of the 23 APC state governors are not happy with him.

He said that those not happy with him in the party were aggrieved because he insisted on following due process.
