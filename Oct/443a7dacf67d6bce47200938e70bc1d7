A Grade “C’’ Customary Court sitting in Iseyin on Monday, dissolved a four-year-old union between Adewale and Shade Ajala, over alleged case of infidelity. Our reporter gathered  that the estranged wife, Shade had approached the court in July seeking dissolution, alleging infidelity and dereliction of marital duties by Adewale. Adewale, who did not refute his wife’s claims, appealed to the court to help beg his wife for forgiveness and reconciliation during the trial. Delivering judgment on the matter, the President of the Court, Chief Adelodun Raheem, said all efforts to settle the matter did not yield results. He explained that the matter had gone beyond redemption, more so as the union had not produced any child. Raheem, thereafter, dissolved the union accordingly and urged both parties to maintain peace.
