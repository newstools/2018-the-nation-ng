A Chief Magistrate’s Court in Minna, Niger State, has ordered the remand in prison custody of a 32-year-old farmer, Rilwanu Salisu, after he pleaded guilty to raping a 78-year-old woman. He is being tried for rape, contrary to Section 282 of the Penal Code Law. Police prosecutor Mr. Daniel Ikwoche said the victim’s son, Mukhtar Garba reported the matter at Nasko Police Station on September 14. Ikwoche quoted the complainant, who alleged that the accused, a resident of Kwada in Magama Local Government, entered his mother’s room while she was asleep, and forcefully had sex with her. He added that the complainant said the victim sustained injuries. When the charge was read to the accused, he pleaded guilty, and begged for leniency. Chief Magistrate Nasiru Muazu declined to take the accused’s plea because his court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the matter. He directed the police to forward a copy of the case file to the director of Public Prosecution for legal advice. Muazu ordered the accused remanded in prison custody pending outcome of the advice, and adjourned the case till October 25 for further mention.
