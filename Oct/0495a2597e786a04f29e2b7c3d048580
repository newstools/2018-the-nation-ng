Oshiomhole said “after today’s convention, we are ready for 2019 electioneering campaign and we believe that we have a lot to disclose to Nigeria. Our opponent are going to produce their candidate and we will look at their records. If they are former governors, we will go to their states and we will call on their people to show evidence of their performance. “If you cannot manage your house, you cannot manage a community. If you cannot manage a community,you can’t manage a state and if you failed as a state Governor, you cant possibly win as a president. We will look at their records and background and compare the to Buhari’s record and the Nigerian people will decide. “If you say you will put air conditioners all over the country, we will find out how many you have put in your state. If you governed for eight years,we will find our what impact you have made in your state. He said Nigeria and indeed the process of change is work in progress and that process has to be sustained. As progressive s, we must ensure that we don’t down play the purpose of government, including the payment of salaries of workers. “You have said that you wonder how people sleep when they have not paid their employees, saying “even the Bible says that a worker deserve his wages. Wages are not paid out of pity, but those who work must be paid their wages.” He appealed to governors of the party to ensure they pay the salaries and pension of workers as and when due especially when they get extra money from the federal government.
