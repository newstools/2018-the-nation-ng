CEO of Amen Estate Babatunde Gbadamosi has said that the regulation of the media will amount to muzzling freedom of expression. He stated this at the Ngozi Agbo lecture organised by the Press Club of the University of Lagos on October 11, 2018. Gbadamosi said there is no need to regulate the information exchanged on the online platform since the opinions expressed in meeting places like the vendor stands, eateries and others cannot be regulated. “Even if we go ahead to regulate the information exchanged on the online platform , are we still going to regulate the information and opinions exchanged and expressed at the vendor stand, eateries and other places?” He also urged the government to leave the regulation of the online platform and meet the infrastructural needs of the technological sector which he said will increase employment. “Leave the regulation of the social media and provide strong networks and other necessary infrastructure to meet the unending employment needs, provision of shelter and meet the basic needs of man” He added that journalists have failed in delivering top notch investigative reports by not investigating the past of politicians which are most times ugly. On the problem with the country, he said “the issue with Nigeria is that Nigerians are too superficial, they like things that are shining.“
