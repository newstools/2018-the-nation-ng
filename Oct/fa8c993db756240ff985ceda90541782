The Federal Fire Service has advised Nigerians to be careful in handling candle light so as to minimize the risk of fire outbreak associated with its use. The Public Relations Officer (PRO) of the Service, Ugo Huan, gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria on Wednesday in Abuja. Huan said that careless handling of candle light had resulted to loss of lives and destruction of property in the country. She said that some fire disasters caused by candle light could have been avoided if necessary care had been taken by the users. “Candle fire risk could be minimized by keeping burning candle within sight and extinguishing it while out of sight. The PRO also advised users to place burning candle only on candle holders specifically designed for the burning of candles. “Avoid burning of candles near combustible items such as window blinds, furniture items, clothing materials, bedding/carpets. “Keep burning candles away from children or where they can be kicked off. “Burn candles in a well-ventilated room,” she said.
