The Vice-Chancellor (VC) of Benson Idahosa University (BIU), Prof Sam Guobadia, has urged the school’s employees to improve students’ academic experience by making integrity, accountability, teamwork and honesty their watchwords in the discharge of their duties. The VC gave the admonition during the 2018 Staff Orientation Programme, organised by the school in preparation for the new academic session. Prof Guobadia enjoined the staff not to engage in acts that would tarnish their professional reputation and put them in trouble with the school. According to the VC, the value proposition, which the university is selling to the world, is academic excellence with godliness. He thanked the management and staff for their commitment and hard work towards the achievements recorded in the last academic year. Speaking on University’s culture, vision and mission, President of the school, Bishop F.E.B. Idahosa, urged members of staff to be disciplined and keep their focus on how to excel in their individual tasks. He said: “For you to raise a leader, you must also be a leader. A follower cannot raise a leader, only a leader can raise a leader. We are raising people, who will have positive influence in our communities and the nation.” He praised the employees for their “steadfastness and commitment” to the raising leaders, who are complete in spirit, mind and body, thus contributing to the production of high-level leadership and quality manpower for the nation and the world. The registrar, Reverend Mike Okagbare, who spoke on Disciplined professional administrator, advised new staff to avail themselves of the school rules, adding that their activities must be result-driven in order to achieve the goals set for the academic session.
