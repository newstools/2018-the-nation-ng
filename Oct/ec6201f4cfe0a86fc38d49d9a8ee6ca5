Millennials within the age bracket of 21 and 30 in the insurance industry, will soon be lending their voices to the future of insurance business in the country, President, Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), Eddie Efekoha, has said. Efekoha who spoke at a media parley in Lagos, said the Institute is providing a platform called, Millennial Assembly for the young professionals to contribute to the development of the industry. He said the Institute is set to host the Millennials Assembly to equipÂ  young professionals and enable them to chart new ways for the industry. He said the institute has written to insurance companies to send their staff within the age bracket to attend the event, noting that 31 companies had so far indicated interest to participate. He noted that the institute is mindful of the fact that the future of the industry rests on the shoulders of the youth, hence the institute has to prepare them for the jobs ahead. He further stated that his tenure will focus on his key mandate of advancing insurance education and professionalism to propel the insurance sector forward. He disclosed that the partnership programmes initiated with some tertiary institutions are already yielding results as the Senate of University of Lagos had last week approved the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the parties. He said that the programme when operational, will pave way for Nigerians to run their masters in insurance in the country, instead of going to the United Kingdom.
