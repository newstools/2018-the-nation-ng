A new beauty pageantry initiative, Mrs. Nigeria Pageants, is basing its catchment areas on physical beauty, marital stability, career progression, intellectual agility, social trendiness, and humanitarian compassion. An initiative of Pageants Nigeria Limited, the non-bikini beauty queen contest for outstanding married women between the ages of 23 and 45, will make debut on October 21, 2018, at Balmora Hall, Federal Palace Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos. Organisers say the show which has PWAN Group, a Real Estate Network Marketing Firm in Africa as the headline sponsor, will give the eventual winner the privilege to represent Nigeria at the prestigious Mrs. Universe Contest holding in the Philippines in December later this year. Managing Director of Pageants Nigeria Limited, Mrs. Sarah Anogwi, said at a press conference that the event, which would start with a two-day camping of contestants between October 19 and 20 at an exclusive resort on the Island, will climax on October 21 in a glamorous grand finale where the overall winner will be crowned and given a brand new SUV, a cash prize of N1million and a plot of land in a choice area at Ibeju Lekki. The first and second runners up, according to Anogwi, will also get cash prizes of N500, 000 and N300, 000 respectively among other benefits. Anogwi, a former international model who doubles as Country Director for Mrs. Universe Pageants, noted that the statutory objective of the contest is to identify, appreciate and reward and as well empower the lucky winners with the necessary support system in the quest to further advance the course of social justice for the women folks. She said the programme also intends to promote public awareness against domestic violence, gender inequality, societal oppression and all forms of social injustices against the women, while also providing funding and other structural support systems for humanitarian projects and programmes that would empower women, teenage mothers and children.
