•Governor accompanies Buhari to Seme Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has assured Nigerians, especially Lagosians, that he will lead a strong campaign to ensure victory for President Muhammadu Buhari and the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in next year’s general elections. Ambode made the promise when he addressed reporters at the Presidential Wing of the Muritala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, after receiving and accompanying President Buhari to the inauguration of the new Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) border posts at Seme-Krake in Badagry. The governor said it was important for the APC to retain its leadership positions at the federal and the state levels. He said: “I have just accompanied Mr. President to the Nigerian-Benin Border Post. So, what we have inaugurated today is a joint border patrol post between Nigeria and the Republic of Benin; it is called Seme-Krake Border Post. “But again, just to also use this opportunity to let Lagosians know that we are heavily committed to the re-election of Mr. President, you can see that his continuous visits to Lagos reiterate the fact that he is actually a lover of Lagos State. I am committed to ensuring his re-election. “We are going to campaign heavily for him. I am also committed to ensuring that the APC wins the governorship election come 2019. We support the candidacy of Babajide Sanwo-Olu and we will make sure that APC retains Lagos State and the centre.” The governor earlier received President Buhari at the airport before they proceeded to Seme where the President joined his Republic of Benin counterpart, Patrice Talon, to inaugurate the border post.
