The Food Basket Farmers’ Cooperative Society, Ogijo-Ikorodu chapter, yesterday urged Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to support farmers with interest-free loans, to boost agricultural production. The Chairman, Mr. John Atodo, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that farmers needed increased support to enable them produce more crops, as part of efforts to stem rising food prices. He advised the government to support farmers with inputs such as fertiliser and pesticides, saying such assistance would result in improved harvests. “The cost of growing food crops has risen. Many of us now harvest fewer quantities of crops than what we used to get. “The only way to grow more food items and stimulate increased food supplies to our markets is by financially supporting farmers. “We believe the government can give us interest-free loans to support our agricultural ventures. “The only way to curtail rising food prices is by giving farmers financial support and other forms of assistance to boost their crop cultivation. “There is even nothing wrong for us to demand interest-free loans from the government, as they will enable us to produce more and consequently cause food prices to crash,” Atodo said. He underscored the need for assisting farmers with fertilisers and pesticides, saying such assistance would boost their harvests and aid efforts to safeguard their farms against pest infestation. Atodo said: “We are soliciting assistance with farm inputs such as pesticides because many of us afford the cost of fighting pests.” He said farmers, particularly the smallholder ones, needed training in cost-effective and modern crop production techniques.
