Lagos State government is partnering Pharmacists Council of Nigeria (PCN) to prevent the sale of Chinese drugs allegedly containing human parts, Health Commissioner Dr. Jide Idris has said. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Lagos on the sidelines of the Association of General Private Nursing Practitioners (AGPNP) that the government was keeping an eye on areas it felt would be at risk of the drugs. The National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC) had assured Nigerians of safety, warning people to beware of the poisonous drugs. Idris said: “Every importation is actually at the purview of the Federal Government, NAFDAC, SON, among others. “But, Lagos State is trying its best to collaborate with the Pharmacists Council to regulate and monitor that these drugs don’t get into our markets. “Our drug quality laboratory control is also working to check any drug that is brought in, which efficacy is not known before distribution into the health facilities. “We also have our task force established by the Lagos State government working to ensure that people are safe. “We have not failed in sensitising and enlightening people about the inherent dangers in taking these drugs.’’ A pharmacist, health and safety professional, Mrs. Fayo Williams, urged the Federal Government to pay attention to every importation right from its country of origin.”
