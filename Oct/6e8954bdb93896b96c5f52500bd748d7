The sale of forms for next year’s Hajj will begin on Monday, Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board (LSMPWB) has said. It said yesterday that intending pilgrims are expected to pay N10,000 and N1.4 million initial deposit. The Board Secretary, Abdul Rahman Ishola, said in a statement after meeting officials of the board in Ikeja that the state introduced schemes such as “Payment by Instalment” and “Regular Standard” to make the exercise easier for pilgrims. The payment, he said, could be split into three. Ishola advised intending pilgrims to seize the opportunity to make early payment in order to pick the local government of their choice, as each local government has a specific number of applicants that will be catered for.
