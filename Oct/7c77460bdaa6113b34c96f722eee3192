Eight universities have reached the quarter finals after first round in a soccer competition organised by Higher Institutions Football League (HiFL). Sixteen universities showed up for the maiden edition of the soccer league, which started on September 19. Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi (FUAM) in Benue State and University of Jos (UNIJOS) are facing other tertiary institutions in the quarter final to decide the last four teams to qualify for the Semi finals. CAMPUSLIFE spoke with students from participating universities, who confirmed their excitement in the soccer contest. They urged HiFL and its partners to sustain the competition, describing it as a huge platform for talent discovery and national integration. HiFL, Nigeriaâ€™s foremost varsity football league, is organised by PACE Sports and Entertainment Marketing Limited in partnership with the Nigerian Universities Games Association (NUGA) and sponsored by Stanbic IBTC. The top 16 universities from NUGA-member institutions are competing in over 30 games over a period of 14 weeks in a return leg elimination style, with the final four billed to compete for the first prize at the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos. The winner of the HiFL will represent Nigeria at the 2019 International University Sports Federation Games in Naples, Italy.
