Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA) has introduced a compulsory monthly sanitation. The exercise will be held every second Wednesday of the month. In a memo from the office of the registrar, said the exercise was introduced following a report  submitted by the Committee on Environmental Sanitation. The registrar, Mr Sunday Ayeerun, said: “I write to inform members of staff, students and other members of the university community that the management, after considering the report of the Committee on Environmental Sanitation at its meeting held on July 17, 2018, approved that second Wednesday of every month should be set aside for university-wide sanitation exercise between the period of 9am and 10am, effective from September 2018.” The registrar said members of staff, students who are resident on campus and business operators in the school’s commercial areas will be involved in the monthly sanitation exercise. CAMPUSLIFE gathered that shop owners around the school also started compulsory sanitation because of heavy rainfall witnessed in the community. Residents lamented that constant rain had littered the area with filthy materials from the drainage as a results of poor waste management.
