Five persons from Mgbo in Ebonyi local government area of Ebonyi State have been killed allegedly by their neighboring Agila people of Benue State. The killings, it was gathered, took place on Tuesday night when the people of Agila allegedly invaded two villages in Mgbo. The two border communities have been embroiled in a bitter land tussle spanning decades with many people killed.

Represented by the Deputy Governor, Dr Kelechi Igwe, the governor also paid a condolence visit to families of the affected persons at Ekwashi and Ukwagba communities.

According to him, Ebonyi people have suffered incessant attacks from their neighbors in the recent times and appealed to the federal government to intervene before the people would resort to self defence. Mr Umahi also appealed to the people to remain calm and law abiding, assuring that government would ensure permanent resolution of the crisis. The state Commissioner of Police, Musa Kimo promised that the situation has been brought under control. He appealed to the people of the area to remain calm and go about their lawful business. The chairman of Ohaukwu local government Council Barr Clement Odah told the governor that Benue people invaded the people of Ngbo despite peace agreement signed with Ado local government council few weeks ago. He lamented the incessant attack and called on Benue state government to call Agila people to order. The governor was accompanied by security chiefs including CP Musa Kimo and representatives of the Cantonment Commander, Major S Milla.
