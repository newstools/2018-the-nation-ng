Super Falcons’ Coach, Thomas Dennerby has praised the camp facility provided by the leadership of the Nigeria Football Federation, NFF for the team in preparation for the Africa Women’s Nations Cup to be held in Ghana, AOIFootball.com reports. Dennerby, who was a spectator at the finals of the 2018 Women Aiteo Cup also commended the champions, Rivers Angel for their tactical display. Speaking on his rating of the quality of the game, Dennerby said: “It was a good final and both teams could have won it. I think in open play, Ibom was a bit quicker, a bit more attacking players with more passes. Rivers Angel was playing more straight and of course, they were playing their fourth so very tough to compete with, very tough with set pieces. They created a lot of chances from that and of course, they scored”. Dennerby said he was also impressed with the Rivers Angels goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie’s development, stating that after she conceded goals against France in a friendly, she has shown much improvement. “I told everybody involved in women football in February that she is one for the future. I think she has improved well. Now the next step is not to have it long, the next step is to have it exactly where you want it. But she is an extremely good goalkeeper for her age,” said Dennerby. Responding to question on the Super Falcons group in the upcoming Women AFCON, the Coach, whilst acknowledging that it is a very tough group, said he believes the team will progress to the semifinals. “First of all, I think we have a good chance to reach the semifinal. It’s a tough game, the first one against South Africa. I know and you probably also know that they have played a lot of games to prepare the team. We know that it will be a tough game.
