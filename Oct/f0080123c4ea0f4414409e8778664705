Two men, who allegedly impersonated Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) officials and stole  N800,000, were yesterday arraigned at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. The accused – unemployed Ibrahim Sodiq, 27, a resident of Iyana-Ipaja and Chijioke Ugwu, 27, a teacher, who lives at Ijegun were arraigned before Magistrate F.F. George. The duo are facing a four-count charge of conspiracy, impersonation, obtaining money under false pretences and stealing. They denied the charges. The magistrate granted the accused N500, 000 bail each with two sureties each. She said the sureties should be employed with an evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State government. Prosecutor Godwin Awase said the accused committed the offences in August at Akowonjo, a Lagos suburb. He said the accused and three others yet to be apprehended, conspired to obtain N800, 000 from Mr. Afolabi Sowede, on the pretext of committing felony. “The accused went to the complainant’s office, claiming they were from EFCC in Ikoyi. They accused him of committing a crime. “The accused, armed with weapons, packed the complainant’s employees in a room and collected their phones, to prevent them from making calls. “They asked the complainant how much he had in his account and he told them he had N1 million. They checked his account balance to confirm. “The complainant was forced to transfer N800, 000 to some bank accounts, as they threatened to harm him if he refused to comply and he obeyed,” Awase told the court. He said after the accused had left, the complainant reported the case to the police and two of the accused were arrested. “The long arm of the law caught up with one of the owners of the accounts, which was used to perpetrate the crime and this led to the arrest of the accused.” The offences contravene sections 287, 380(1), 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The case was adjourned till November 14.
