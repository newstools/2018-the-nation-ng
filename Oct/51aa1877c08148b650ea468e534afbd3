CRISTIANO RONALDO is relaxed fixture ahead of his reunion with former club Manchester United in the Champions League, according to Fernando Bernardeschi. Ronaldo is primed to start Juventus’ Champions League showdown with Manchester United, having missed their last European encounter against Young Boys through suspension. Cristiano Ronaldo spent six years at Manchester United and, when he returned to the club with Real Madrid in 2013, had a mixed night. “Competition, it’s an extra stimulus, it forces you to give your best,” he said. “Ronaldo, he’s very calm, he’s focused. “He’s a champion in the field and mentally, he wants to score and to do well.” Meanwhile, Juventus boss Massimiliano Allegri has hit out at his side, saying their draw against Genoa was down to their focus on the United game. “We left the game after a good start,” he told Sky Sport Italia. “We conceded a goal from a loss of focus. These are situations that shouldn’t happen. “They’re games in which the Scudetto can be won and lost. “We played, from a certain point of view, with our heads in Manchester. We had to win. We went from frantic to sleeping and vice versa.”
