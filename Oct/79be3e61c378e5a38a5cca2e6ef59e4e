Former Student Union Leader and Senatorial aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) foe Benue South, Daniel Onjeh said on Friday that the fortunes of the party in the forth coming general elections will be determined by it’s ability to quickly resolve all contending issues arising from the party primaries. Onjeh who spoke with newsmwn at the party see Secretariat on Friday evening said the party may lose the general election if it failed to successfully resolve all contending issues. He also said that contrary to insinuations in the media, the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar poses no threat to the reelection bid of President Muhammadu Buhari. The NANS President ho complained of being shortchanged at the recent party primary election in the Benue state, said the leadership of the APC must work hard to reconcile aggrieved members so that the chances of the party would not affected by the spill-over of the primary election crisis, adding that the appeal panel set up by the party must do what is right and just so as bring back members to forge a common front ahead of the 2019 general elections. While dismissing the endorsement of former Atiku  Ahubakar by former President Olusegun Obasanjo and religious leaders  Onjeh  said that President Buhari has done enough to earn him a second term.He said that the former president’s are ganging up against President Buhari because they will all be made to account for their ill-gottcn wealth if he is re-elected. “The same Obasanjo who gushed over Atiku a couple of days ago, is the same person who wrote in the second volume of his hagiography, My Watch: Why I Did Not Let Atiku Succeed Me as President,” he said. On the alleged cases of corruption during the past PDP administration with similar scandals witnessed in the last three and half years of President Buhari’s administration, Onjeh said president has tried to deal with any such acts even if slowly. Onjeh said: “Atiku is not a threat to President Buhari’s chances of re-election in 2019. While Buhari is lionized as an epitome of integrity, transparency, and accountability, qualities which informed his adoption by the African Union as the continent’s anti-corruption champion, Alhaji Abubakar, a former deputy controller general of the then exceedingly corrupt Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), a man whose source of stupendous wealth is a mystery hidden in a Pandora’s box of riddles, has been mentioned in tales of corruption, shady and underhand deals”.
