A Federal High Court in Lagos has sentenced Adamu Umar, 27, to nine monthsâ€™ imprisonment for trafficking in Cannabis Sativa (Indian hemp). The judge, Justice Ayokunle Faji, said yesterday that the convict was found guilty of the offence as charged by the prosecution, saying the sentence would begin from the date of his arrest. Prosecutor Mr. Jeremiah Aernan of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arraigned the convict on a one-count charge of drug trafficking. He said the convict was arrested in Lagos, on September 15, following a tip-off. Aernan said the convict was arrested with packages of Cannabis Sativa (Indian hemp) weighing 300g. According to the prosecutor, Cannabis Sativa is classified as a restricted narcotics and its trafficking contravenes Section 11 (c) of the NDLEA Act, Cap N30, Laws of the Federation, 2004. The convict pleaded guilty and begged for mercy. He promised to be of good behaviour if pardoned. The prosecutor tendered before the court a written statement of the accused, a request for scientific aid form, a drug analysis form, a bulk of the exhibit and remnant of the narcotics. The court admitted the exhibits in evidence. Aernan urged the court to convict and sentence the accused on the basis of the evidence adduced by prosecution.
