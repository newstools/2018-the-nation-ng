Currently on his Life on the Outside UK tour, Afrobeat music sensation Burna Boy is not leaving fans in doubt of his ace game as he recently sold out his concert at the O2 Arena, Brixton. From the release of his ‘Outside’ album early this year to thechart-topping success of’Ye’, his collaboration with Major Lazer, and launching a limited edition cereal, the Afrofusion star has shown no signs of slowing down. The show kicked off with insane energy where the intro clip started playing to Burna Boy driving unto the stage in his getaway car. From beginning to end, Burna matched the crowd’s energy, and delivered several of his hits back to back, with performances by Kida kudz, Nissi, Rebecca Garton, Not3s, and Four of Diamonds in between sets. One of the show’s most defining moments was when the instruments went off and Burna performed excitedly to the crowd singing ’Ye’ acapella. ‘The Life on the Outside’ UK tour takes Burna Boy to seven UK cities.
