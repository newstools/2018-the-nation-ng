An afro-pop singer, Kayode Obafemi, has released a new singer, ‘Duro.’ The Nigerian, who is based in South Africa, is signed to Only For The Family, a company situated in Johannesburg. Kayode, while speaking about his new song, said Duro was inspired by his state of the mind at a time. He added, “I was very down and bothered five months ago. Then, the only place I wanted to be was the production studio because it is my comfort zone.” According to him, moving to South Africa was important for him to acquire some other professional skills in cinematography. “I feel I can make an impact from the Diaspora; we all know that the Nigerian entertainment industry is highly competitive. I released my first song in 2006 and there has been a lot of improvement since then.” Also, the English graduate of Obafemi Awolowo stated that he had always enjoyed the support of his parents, saying, “I could recall how my mother booked my first studio session. She paid N4,600.” The talented act, however,  have plans to work with Wizkid, Davido, Olamide , Tiwa Savage, Burna Boy, Wande Coal and Flavour in future.
