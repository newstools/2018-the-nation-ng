Coach Paul Aigbogun has told SCORENigeria the country’s U-20 team, the Flying Eagles, will stage an open screening to build a team for next year’s U20 AFCON in Niger. Aigbogun disclosed: “We will soon begin preparations for the U20 AFCON and we have decided to change the pattern of recruiting players this time – it will be an open screening to give young players a chance to be discovered. “Both the invited players and other players will be screened together for everyone to have an equal chance on the field of play. Whoever makes it from this screening will make my team.” He added: “Nigerians is a country with a good football profile  and we hope to keep this profile going for us by coming up with the best of the best for the U-20 squad that will bring pride to the nation.” The former Enyimba also told SCORENigeria he has turned in his training proposal to the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to approval. The Flying Eagles eliminated Guinea Bissau and Mauritania to qualify for the 2019 U-20 AFCON in Niger in February.
