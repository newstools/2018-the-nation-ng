The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday lost a member each at the House of Representatives. The lawmakers are: Hassan Omale (PDP, Kogi), and Muhammad Soba (APC, Kaduna). Omale, who represents Ankpa/Omala/Olamaboro Federal Constituency in Kogi State, told his colleagues that he had left the PDP for the African Democratic Congress (ADC). “I wish to inform the Speaker and other members of the House that I have resigned from the PDP to the African Democratic Congress (ADC) with effect from October 17,” he said. The lawmaker conveyed his defection in a letter read by Speaker Yakubu Dogara at plenary in Abuja. Soba, who represents Soba Federal Constituency in Kaduna State, announced his departure from the APC. He said his next destination would be announced soon. Announcing the defections, Dogara cited relevant sections of the constitution to justify the actions of the defectors. The Speaker said Soba attributed his action to an alleged injustice he suffered during his party’s primary.
