In its 4th edition, AHBEAwards was established in 2015 to celebrate and honour eminent Africans who have contributed to the development of the race through their crafts and talents, especially in the entertainment and the broadcasting industries. According to the Nigerian coordinator of the Awards, Yomi Fash-Lanso, “This year’s edition will stretch to accommodate established African entrepreneurs and sports people. We believe in pushing Africa further through those who are really and truly making AFRICA proud so that young Africans would see the need to believe and excel in their own way without being intimidated or run down.” Previous honourees include Adebayo Salami, Fabian Olojede, Ella Mensa, Kunle Afolayan, Sadiq Daba, Pete Edochie, Dayo Adeneye, Ini Edo, Odunlade Adekola, Femi Adebayo, Muyiwa Ademola and Liz Benson among other top African stars.
