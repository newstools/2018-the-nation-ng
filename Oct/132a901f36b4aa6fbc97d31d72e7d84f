A suit filed by 16 local government chairmen at the Ekiti State High Court to stop their removal from office has suffered another adjournment. The council chairmen, led by the chairman of the state chapter of the Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON), Mr. Dapo Olagunju, filed the suit to stop the new governor, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, from dissolving the council. The local government chairmen, who are all Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members, were elected last December. Defendants in the suit are: Fayemi (first), Governor of Ekiti State (second), Attorney General (third), Speaker (fourth) and House of Assembly (fifth). Counsel to first and second defendants, Mr. Ibrahim Olarewaju, informed the court of his intent to file a new application. The application borders on change of counsel. But counsel to the plaintiffs, Mr. Ezekiel Agunbiade, opposed the move, saying the application was premature. Counsel to the fourth and fifth defendants, Mr. Adeoye Aribsoye, also declared his intention to file an application. Agunbiade argued that the defendants must be put on notice about the change of counsel by the defendants. But Justice Abiodun Adesodun, who agreed with the plaintiffsâ€™ counsel that they reserved the right to be put on notice, urged the lawyers to agree on a date. The counsel agreed on November 2 for the continuation of the matter. Justice Adesodun adjourned the matter till November 2 for the hearing of pending applications.
