The crisis rocking the Zamfara State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) may be far from over. A front line governorship aspirant in the state, Senator Kabiru Garba Marafa , on Friday dissociated himself from a meeting convened by the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole with Zamfara governorship aspirants on Thursday. Marafa who was reacting a publication on ” Oshiomhole meets Zamfara Guber aspirants, as party considers Lawal”, claimed that Oshiomhole met with the nine governorship aspirants in Abuja on Thursday. The Zamfara Central senator in a statement said that he was not aware of the meeting. He said,”My attention has been drawn to publication headlined: “Oshiomhole meets Zamfara Guber aspirants, as party considers Lawal. ” I want to state emphatically that nobody invited me to any meeting after the failed attempt to conduct primaries/consensus as at 12am Sunday 7th Oct 2018. ” I want to restate further for emphasis that there was neither election nor consensus reached among APC aspirants in Zamfara state.” Marafa insisted that he would not be party to any move to trade with the APC Governorship ticket of Zamfara, saying that due process and rule of law must be religiously adhered to. He said, “I will not be a party to any attempt by anybody to sell the tickets of APC to any desperate politician(s) by anybody. “I will resist any attempt by anybody to do so. May Allah (SWT) guide us to the straight path and give us the ability to act justly and fairly,” he said.
