SEBASTIAN Coates has been hailed as a hero after his quick thinking potentially saved a team mate’s life during a game in Portugal. The Uruguay international defender, who formerly played for Liverpool and Sunderland, was in action for current club Sporting Lisbon against Portimonense in the Primeira Liga. During the game, his goalkeeper Romain Salin collided with the post and was left unconscious – prompting Coates to step in with emergency aid to clear his airways. Sallin had been hurt as he attempted to save Portimonense’s second goal, scored by striker Shoya Nakajima. The keeper was knocked out, with the risk that he would be unable to breathe if his tongue was blocking his throat. As Sporting physios raced onto the pitch, Coates opened Sallin’s mouth and placed his fingers inside, ensuring that there was no blockage and that breathing was possible. In a clip captured by TV coverage of the game and shared widely on social media, the 28-year-old is seen frantically gesturing to the bench for medical help, which soon arrives. Coates, who joined Sporting on loan from Liverpool in 2016 before making a permanent move 12 months later, later scored but could not prevent a 4-2 defeat. The defender, capped 31 times by Uruguay, spent three years at Anfield, which included time spent on loan at Sunderland.
