The Organised Private Sector (OPS) under the auspices of Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) said Dangote Oil Refining and Petrochemicals will transform the downstream oil sector of the petroleum industry. Beyond that, the group said the economic benefits of the oil refinery, when completed would have  far reaching positive effects on the lives of Nigeria and her people. Speaking after leading members of the group on a tour of Dangote Jetty, Refinery and Fertilizer plants in Lagos,  LCCI President Babatunde Paul Ruwase said the project is massive and its impact would be spectacular. He expressed satisfaction with  the pace of work at the Refinery and Fertilizer plants, which he described as a game changer for the oil sector. He commended the President/Chief Executive of Dangote Group, Alhaji Aliko Dangote for the enormous investment in Africa.
