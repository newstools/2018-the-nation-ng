The National Orientation Agency (NOA) has called on Nigerians to revive the spirit of nationalism that characterised the struggle for independence as the only path to sustainable national development. Dr Garba Abari, the Director-General of NOA in a statement on Monday in Abuja said the nation’s founding fathers put the national interest ahead of personal and sectional interests. Abari described such disposition as a precursor to true national development. “The desired greater Nigeria will be achieved if Nigerians embrace themselves as brothers and comrades and work toward the common good, eschewing rancour and unhealthy rivalry. “The shortage of patriotic zeal among Nigerians today has resulted in the expansion of the nation’s fault lines manifesting as various forms of violence and intolerance. “I urged Nigerians to recommit themselves to imbibing the national core values of self-reliance, patriotism, religious tolerance, dignity of labour, discipline, integrity and social justice as enshrined in Chapter Two of the 1999 Constitution,” he said. The NOA boss congratulated Nigerians on the Independence Anniversary, saying the true meaning of independence would manifest when the nation reflects the aspiration of its citizens. (NAN)
