“If you will agree with me, he was the first comedian. Also a musician and King Sunny Ade’s mentor, he had touched a lot of lives. I did not know we were related until 15 years ago when we met at a function at my home town and we got introduced as relations. As at the time he retired he went fully into ministry. I thank God for his optical movie, though it was pirated and that affected him, but he tried his best. If he did not start it then, I am sure we won’t have people in that line today.”
