We know the importance of the game so we will try and win it for our fans. I think winning the game will help boost our confidence ahead of our Champion’s League game on Wednesday, so we will go all out for the three points,” Onyekuru concluded. Galatasaray who are yet to taste defeat at home in all competition come into the game in the first position with 18 points while Bursaspor is 14th on the log with eight points.
