The Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) yesterday restated its commitment to train and improve the capacities of district officers that process planning permits. The General Manager, Mr. Funmi Osifuye, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the training was necessary to improve the technical and professional skills of the officers for efficient and effective service delivery to the public. He said the training would educate the officers on the ethics/conducts of processing building permits. According to him, the training will help to address and avert some of the issues/challenges that emanate in the course of granting building permits. “The training, which will be an in-house quarterly programme for the district officers and management staff in the planning field, will treat 10 carefully selected professional and technical topics in town planning. “The topics include: Planning Permit Application Processing, Guidelines and Procedure; Strategies for Increase in Revenue Generation; Site Monitoring and Public Relations; Planning Information and its Relevance to Planning Permit Processing. “Others include Report, Memo Writing and File Management; Importance of Technical Report in Planning Permit Processing; Unified Assessment Rates; and Ethics, Conduct and Responsibilities of a District Officer. “The last topic is State Land Acquisition and Revocation: Its Implications on the Grant of Planning Permit. “The major focus for the training is to expose the planners to requisite skills and knowledge of modern planning. The agency has just concluded the second in the series of the training,” Osifuye said. Mr. Lateef Oladeinde, a deputy director in the Development Permit Department, LASPPPA, urged the district officers to take the opportunity to enhance their technical knowledge about planning permit processing.
