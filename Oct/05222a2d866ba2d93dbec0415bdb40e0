Osun State governor-elect Gboyega Oyetola has said the unity and stability of Nigeria is guaranteed under President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration. Oyetola, in a statement by the Director-General of his Ileri-Oluwa Campaign Organisation, Ajibola Famurewa,  described the independence anniversary as significant being the first national event after his victory. The governor-elect, who noted the efforts of the nation’s founding fathers to build a united Nigeria without sentiment, nepotism and corruption, maintained that the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government is positioned to provide security, infrastructure, good governance and quality education as well as affordable medical services for the citizenry. According to him, with Buhari in the saddle, Nigerians should be sure of a nation that would be respected within and outside the African continent. He, therefore, urged the citizens to support Buhari in his effort to build a nation of every one’s dream.
