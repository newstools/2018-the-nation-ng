The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwunsi Ojaja II, has dissociated himself from the activities of a group called “Ooni Outreach Foundation”. Ooni distanced himself from the group described as “faceless’’ in a statement by the Director of Media and Public Affairs his palace, Mr Moses Olafare, on Friday, in Ile-Ife. Olafare said the disclaimer became necessary due to reports the palace received on fraudulent activities of unscrupulous individuals who had been swindling the public under the guise of representing the Arole Oodua. He said the royal father had no link with with “Ooni Outreach Foundation” or any other group claiming to be raising funds to care for the needy. The palace spokesman listed authentic associations belonging to the Ooni’s palace as “House of Oduduwa Foundation” and “Hopes Alive Initiative (HAI)”. He advised the public to verify from the palace any claim made by any other outfit beside the listed two before giving out donations. Olaife gave “Instagram: @ooniadimulaife; Twitter: @ooniadimulaife; Facebook: Ooni Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi – Ojaja II (@ooniadimulaife) as social media platforms personal to the Ooni. He cautioned against “nefarious antics and evil machinations always deployed by sacrilegious criminals, especially through social media platforms which they have created to dupe people.” NAN
