Lagos State government has begun a sensitisation/awareness programme against juvenile delinquency in schools, Youth and Social Development Commissioner Agboola Dabiri has said. He said the consequence on academic performance had become worrisome, adding that the government would not allow youths to go astray. Agboola, who spoke at the launch of the programme at Onikan Youth Centre, Lagos said juvenile delinquency among pupils was arousing concern in the society, adding that the programme would be taken across the six educational districts. The commissioner, represented by the Director of Social Welfare, Mr. Olabode Ajao, said the reduction of enrolled pupils due to juvenile delinquency had resulted in poor academic performance and drop out. “Juvenile delinquency has made pupils to resort to vices such as cultism, stealing, fighting, prostitution, among others.” Agboola advised stakeholders, parents and guardians to support the government in curbing the menace. The Permanent Secretary, Mr. Hakeem Muri-Okunola, said the programme would be taken to private schools and not limited to public schools.
