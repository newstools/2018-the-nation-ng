Beneficiaries of Empowerment Programmes have been advised to utilize whatever given to them to improve their standards of living.A member of the House of Representatives, Dr Dolapo Enitan Badru, who offered the advice during the presentation of cash gifts to 120 petty traders in Isale-Eko, Lagos Island, said that “some beneficiaries of such programmes see the money as the sharing of the national cake and use what they give them for social activities instead of using it to develop their businesses. Dr. Badru, who is representing the Lagos Island Constituency One in the House of Representatives, stated that normally it was not the responsibility of lawmakers to do empowerment programmes, but the harsh economic situation in the country called for their intervention to assist the executive arm of government to improve the living standards of the residents. He explained that in the past, when he gave twenty tricycles (keke maruwa) to some people, he heard that a beneficiary sold it for quick money. The lawmaker stated that as a responsible politician, happiness of the electorate must be his happiness and he would continue to do everything to make his people happy. The lawmaker also used the occasion to enjoin the electorate of the 10 wards in his constituency to always summit a memo to his constituency office on their needs from the government, so that he could assist them to pursue their requests. Dr Badru added that “those who have not collected their permanent voter cards still have the opportunity to do so before general elections”. He used the opportunity to expressed gratitude to leaders of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the area, particularly Prince Tajudeen Olusi and all members of the party, for voting for him last Thursday to represent the party in next year general elections.
