THE electorate in Kwara State have been urged to make experience an important factor in determining the next governor of the state. Speaking to reporters during an empowerment programme for youths and women, Commissioner for Finance Alhaji Nurudeen Banu, enjoined voters to shun “part-time politicians who will appear shortly before the election only to disappear afterwards till the next election”. Banu said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Alhaji Razak Atunwa, is the most qualified to take over from Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed, based on his governance experience. He said: “There is no way you can compare Atunwa with the candidates of the other political parties. “Atunwa has gone through many aspects of governance; he has served as a commissioner, Speaker of the House of Assembly and he is currently a federal lawmaker. He knows what to do when he gets to power; he knows the terrain, so he is not someone who would spend two years or more learning how government businesses are conducted. He will hit the ground running, because he has the experience and the exposure. Banu added: “We don’t even know who really the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate is; we were told that someone won, but the party announced another person as the winner. The issue is not yet resolved.”
