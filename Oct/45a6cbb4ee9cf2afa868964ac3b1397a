The Federal Road Safety Commission, FRSC, has stepped up –up its ‘’ember months’ campaign activities aimed at checkmating reckless driving by motorists and reducing road accidents and road traffic incidents in Katsina state, as the year gradually draws to an end The Route Commander and Public Relations Officer of the Katsina state command of the agency, Abdullahi D. Ibrahim told The Nation, in an exclusive interview in his office in Katsina on Saturday, that the ‘ember months’ (September to December), have always remained tasking to the agency due to increased road usage by people and motorists moving from one part of the country to the other, as well as other haulage activities He said “During this period there are a lot of issues on ground, and we are expected to meet up with attendant challenges ,such as enforcing the rules on motoring such as ensuring compliance on no use of mobile phones while driving, conducting special patrols on roads to checkmate accidents’’ ‘’We are currently on public enlightenment campaigns to sensitize the public, on over speeding, use of phones while driving and other traffic offences. We have already visited 5 media house in the last two weeks to intensify enlightenment and awareness campaign’’ The Route Commander also frowned at overloading of vehicles by drivers especially those plying along Katsina- Daura and Katsina –Dutsinma roads in the state, who usually carry passengers even in the boots of their vehicles, urging the passengers to shun the urge to be packed like goods simply because of a reduced fare. He said “We are leveraging on the various safety campaigns we have embarked upon to sensitize especially the Road transport Workers union, on the dangers of overloading He described the report on road accidents in the state in the outgoing year as fair compared to similar statistics obtained on road performance last year Mr Ibrahim also acknowledged the rising cases of absenteeism by staff of the agency and warned that the Command’s Provost Marshal is out to discipline erring staff members and that actions have been lined up against those who break the rules.
