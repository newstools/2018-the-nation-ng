The Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday convicted a medical doctor, Dennis Konyeaso, for cocaine trafficking. The court, however, could not pass a sentence because the doctor is on the run. Justice Mohammed Idris discharged and acquitted Konyeasoâ€™s wife Chidi, who was charged along with him by the National Drugs Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). They were arraigned in 2012 on four-count charge of conspiracy, unlawful dealing and storing of 3.3 kilograms of cocaine. NDLEA alleged that the couple, in July 2007, conspired to export 3.3 kilograms of cocaine with the aid of an ex-convict Victor Keyamo. They were also alleged to have stored the banned substance at their Plot 729 Atere, Omole Estate, Ikeja, Lagos home without lawful authority. Prosecuting counsel Mrs. Obiageri Iwuchukwu said the alleged offence contravenes sections 14(b), 19 and 12 of the NDLEA Act of 2004. Mrs Konyeaso said her husband abandoned her and their three children for several years after he learnt that the NDLEA operatives invaded their house in search of the banned substance. She said she never knew that her husband was into drug trafficking. According to her, she got to know when the officials searched their house and found parcels of cocaine. The case was slated for judgment on Monday, but Mr Konyeaso, who is on bail, was absent. The wife said she did not know his whereabouts. Justice Idris convicted him in absentia but cleared the wife of all the counts. The judge adjourned sentencing until when the convict is arrested.
