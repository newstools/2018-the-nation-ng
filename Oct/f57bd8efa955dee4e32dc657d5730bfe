President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday met behind closed doors with Governors Rochas Okorocha of Imo and Aminu Masari of Katsina States at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The president met separately with governors in his office and the agenda of their meetings were not made known to the public. It would be recalled that Okorocha, who is the chairman of the Progressive Governors’ Forum, had on Oct. 10 met with the president alongside four other governors on the platform of the ruling-All Progressives Congress (APC). The governors included Akinwunmi Ambode of Lagos; Muhammed Abubakar of Bauchi; Kashim Shettima of Borno and Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano state. NAN also reports that Gov. Masari, who last met with the President at the presidential villa on Sept. 13, had pledged 2.5 million votes for President Buhari in the forthcoming 2019 presidential election. Buhari also met behind closed door with Sen. Abu Ibrahim, representing Katsina South at the presidential villa.(NAN)
