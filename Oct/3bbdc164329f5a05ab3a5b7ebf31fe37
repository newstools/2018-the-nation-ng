He also appealed to Nigerians with any form of visual impairment to visit the hospital and not resort to self-help or self- medication considering the delicate nature of the eye. “I will like to encourage anyone with poor vision to go for proper medical check at the hospital to avoid complications given the sensitivity of the eye,” he said. Health Minister  Isaac Adewole, had on March 8, 2018, launched the Buhari Restore Vision Project aimed at restoring sight to 10,000 Nigerians with cataract through surgical intervention.
