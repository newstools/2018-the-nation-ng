The Nation Newspaper on Wednesday engaged Upright4Nigeria, a media campaign aimed at strengthening citizens resistance against corruption on Twitter. The chat focused on corruption with the theme “Citizen’s role in curbing corruption.” Bellow are responses from #TheNationChat with #Upright4Nigeria Can you give us a comprehensive definition of corruption? @Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat #Upright4Nigeria @davidblawal @lotufodunrin @OlowePraise @Meeknessbol @ShehuBello @ninmycountry @NOA_Nigeria — The Nation Nigeria (@TheNationNews) October 10, 2018  Well, it is difficult to define #Corruption especially in the Nigerian context. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationchat However, wikipedia sees it only from Political perspective, which is wrong. https://t.co/JAoPv2YcNB — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  But when you say a comprehensive definition, #Corruption Corruption is generally a fraudulent or criminal act or a subvention of the norm for personal or selfish gains. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat Cc @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @SERAPNigeria @officialEFCC https://t.co/7LpsOkydAY — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  Recently the definition of #Corruption has been expanded to include not just acts of bribery but also every act of denial of rights including nepotism, injustice, etc. It is as basic as jumping queues. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry https://t.co/qxOp2JUPTM — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  It has also included the moral triangle where the breach of moral conduct is seen as corruption like running red lights, throwing trash can out .from moving vehicles etc. So it encapsulates every wrong act or move usually motivated by selfish end #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat https://t.co/6H9yBnuQf9 — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018   Who is to blame for the high level of corruption in the country? @Upright4Nigeria Cc @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @DSamsonItodo @NOA_Nigeria @officialEFCC @PoliceNG @lotufodunrin @seunakioye #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationchat @davidblawal — The Nation Nigeria (@TheNationNews) October 10, 2018  Everyone is at fault in this case. Either as a perpetrator or tolerator (That is an average Nigerian). Because we often judge matters based on our best (crude or refined knowledge) #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat Cc @CDDWestAfrica @ActionAidNG @ninmycountry @TrafficChiefNG https://t.co/gUTppfabwF — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  The government makes a huge note of blaming the previous government of fueling corruption but at this campaign we don't want to join the blame game… #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @TrafficChiefNG 1/2 https://t.co/gUTppfabwF — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  …truth is everybody both government and the people which is the Supply and Demand side must be ready to play critical roles if corruption must be reduced in our society. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat @CCSImpact @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @tracykeshi 2/2 https://t.co/i7dsksfTnq — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  Quickly See this: #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat Are you uilty of such?

We are the sufferers and we can't keep waiting for Politicians that have stolen our wealth & using same to fight back. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat https://t.co/Th85l6GyAi — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  The campaign is interrogating the demand side that is asking the citizens to speak up against acts of corruption. It is also asking the citizens to start to imbibe certain values like Honesty, Integrity and Transparency. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat https://t.co/Th85l6GyAi — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  In what specific ways does corruption hurt the ordinary citizen?#TheNationChat #Upright4Nigeria #Corruption @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @TrafficChiefNG @OlowePraise @ShehuBello @davidblawal @lotufodunrin pic.twitter.com/dml1f1gvJh — The Nation Nigeria (@TheNationNews) October 10, 2018  …Emir of Kano told a story of how a child died on her mother's hands because she could not afford 500 naira to buy medicine. So people die because of such amount. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat 2/2 https://t.co/cdfpQGRfrP — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  Also, let us interrogate the relationship between corruption and poverty. The UN definition of poverty is when a citizen cannot afford the basic necessity of life that hinders his meaningful participation in society. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat https://t.co/cdfpQGRfrP — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  …Imagine that, corruption is both a cause and consequence of poverty and it reduces human dignity. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat 2/2 https://t.co/cdfpQGRfrP — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  What roles should citizens play in curbing #corruption in the country? @Upright4Nigeria#TheNationChat #Upright4Nigeria #Corruption @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @TrafficChiefNG #TheNationchat #Upright4Nigeria @davidblawal @iam_LarryPepper @elMunir5 @lotufodunrin pic.twitter.com/EI4cPBgwxA — The Nation Nigeria (@TheNationNews) October 10, 2018  Citizens role is to stand against #corruption. Hate it in all it forms. How can the ordinary people live a normal life when the schools for their children, the hospitals, good roads, electricity, job creation are in the bank account of few persons #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  Citizens must: Ask questions, we must begin to interrogate what our political leaders are doing and we are glad that message is being understood already. Also we must interrogate ourselves, Resist, Discourage and Report corruption. #Upright4Nigeria #TheNationChat — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  Finally, What do you think of the whistle-blowing policy of the federal government?#TheNationChat #Upright4Nigeria #Corruption @ActionAidNG @CDDWestAfrica @ninmycountry @TrafficChiefNG #TheNationchat #Upright4Nigeria @OlowePraise @davidblawal @iam_LarryPepper @lotufodunrin pic.twitter.com/1ObYVcK38Z — The Nation Nigeria (@TheNationNews) October 10, 2018  Whistleblower policy is one of the efforts by government to curb corruption. If you noticed the mementum seems to have died down. But it was a bold move which was largely successful. We need moves like that but on a sustainable basis #TheNationChat #Upright4Nigeria https://t.co/fAOreVvt78 — #Upright4Nigeria (@Upright4Nigeria) October 10, 2018  That's it on #TheNationChat with @Upright4Nigeria It was nice having you.
