The Prince Olufunmi Eshinlokun Royal Family of Sangotedo in Eti-Osa Local Government of Lagos State has denied a report that its head (Olori Ebi), Alhaji Halidu Bankole Olufunmi, has been removed. Its lawyer, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa, in a statement, urged the government, relevant authorities and stakeholders to disregard a publication on the purported removal. The lawyer said it was “falsely and maliciously” claimed in the anonymous publication on October 22 that Alhaji Olufunmi had been relieved of his office as the family’s Olori Ebi. “The public is hereby requested to kindly disregard and discountenance the said anonymous publication as the handiwork of mischief makers. “Anybody who transacts any business with or conducts any transaction on behalf of Prince Olufunmi Eshinlokun Royal Family of Sangotedo with any other person other than Alhaji Olufunmi does so at his or her own risk and the family shall not be liable in that regard,” Adegboruwa said.
