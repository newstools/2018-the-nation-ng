In fulfilling his promise to make agriculture attractive to the youths, Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has approved N1.5 billion Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Agricultural Development Scheme loan to assist participants in the state’s “Youth-On-The-Ridges” programme. The project is among several policies of the state meant to create jobs for youths. The State Executive Council (Exco) approved the release of the money to enable the youths access the CBN Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme. Over 18,000 youths are currently participating in the agricultural programme of the state government. The facility will attract a single-digit interest rate designed to enable the participants become successful agro-preneurs. The 18,000 youths are selected from the 18 local government areas of the state and are trained in the best practices of agriculture.
