The National Executive Committee of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths (Worldwide) led by Mr Kingsley Dozie has said they would only vote for candidates who would restructure and introduce policies that would improve lives of Nigerians. Its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Osmond Nkeoma, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Dr Okey Nwachukwu and Deputy National Legal Adviser, Emeka Odom, said this in a statement in Owerri on Saturday. The group, however, said that it was not a political party, but would not endorse any political party or candidate whose mandate would not be restructuring the country. It said that the apex Igbo cultural group would only seek for and vote government that had policies and programmes that would better not only the lives of Nigerians, but the Ndigbo in particular. The group called on the public to disregard “the vituperation from fictitious Ohanaeze youths backing the PDP and demanding for the position of vice president from the South East in the 2019 general elections.” It alleged that the said youths were using the name of Ohanaeze youths for dubious endorsements ahead of the 2019 general elections. “We did not have any meeting where we discussed on who should be given ticket or not. “We ask the public to be weary of rumor mongers and dubious elements whose work is to use the name of Ohanaeze Ndigbo youths to dupe, disorientate and endorse unsuspecting Nigerians. ” No meeting was held to discuss on the party vice presidential slot. These elements who parade themselves hide under the media to propagate lies against Igbo youths. “Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths will only vote a candidate who will guarantee Igbo’s welfare and restructure Nigeria and on the basis of personal conviction. “We never sat to endorse any particular political party nor demand for the position of vice president for any candidate,” it said. The group called on the public to ignore the position of any other group parading itself as Ohanaeze ndigbo youth group. NAN
