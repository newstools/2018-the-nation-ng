The Minister of Communication, Adebayo Shittu was also among cabinet members who attended the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday. He arrived at the Council Chamber around 10.45a.m decked in Igbo traditional outfit of black and gold coloured ‘Ishiagu’ top with red, white and black coloured cap to match. Before going to his seat, he spent a lengthy time discussing with the Minister of Science and Technology, Ogbonnaya Onu and later Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu. Shittu, who also attended FEC meeting last week, exchanged pleasantries with other colleagues as he made his way to his seat. Most of them made one remark or the other on his special outfit. The meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari started around 11.01a.m at the Council Chamber of the Presidential Villa, Abuja with the rendition of the National anthem. Opening Muslims prayer was said by the Minister of State for Power, Works and Housing, Mustapha Shehuri, while the Christian prayer was offered by the Minister of Sports, Solomon Dalung. Recall that three weeks ago, Shittu and the immediate past Minister of Women Affairs, Aisha Alhassan, were disqualified from participating in the Oyo and Taraba states governorship primary elections, respectively, under the All Progressives Congress (APC). While Shittu was disqualified for not taking part in the compulsory one year National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) scheme, Alhassan was disqualified over issues of loyalty to APC. Alhassan had immediately resigned from the cabinet. Shittu was also said to have failed to present any NYSC exemption certificate to the APC screening committee. The immediate past Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, had also resigned from the cabinet due to fake NYSC exemption certificate presented to get the job.
