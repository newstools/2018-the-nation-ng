All was peaceful yesterday on the first day of resumption from recess, in the House of Representatives. A stormy session was expected because of the cross carpeting during the recess especially the defection of Speaker Yakubu Dogara from the majority All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Dogara came into the chamber at 11:38am. There was no murmuring, grumbling or any act of discontent. It was unusually solemn, perhaps because of  the honour accorded the late Hon. Funke Adedoyin who died on September 28. Proceedings were adjourned till today in honour of the lawmaker who represented Irepodun/Oke-ero/Isin/Ekiti Federal Constituency of Kwara State. Listed on this week’s Notice Paper are: A bill for an Act to amend the National Tobacco Control Act, 2015, to address the lacuna that may be easily exploited by tobacco industry in Nigeria and to cure certain defects in the Act, ensure its effective implementation in Nigeria; Others are: a bill for an Act to repeal the Advertising Practitioner’s (Registrations, etc) Act and enact the Advertising Practitioner’s (Registrations, Licensing, etc); and a a bill to establish the Council for Advertising Practitioners as the apex regulatory authority for the Nigerian Advertising profession and practice .
