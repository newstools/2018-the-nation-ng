The Chairperson of the Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL), Aisha Falode, was full of praises for the players and officials of Rivers Angels FC of Port Harcourt, for retaining the Aiteo Cup Women’s title after defeating hard fighting Ibom Angels in the final of the competition played on Tuesday at the Samson Siasia Stadium, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. Rivers Angels beat Ibom Angels 1-0 to record a second straight victory against the Akwa Ibom State-owned team in the Aiteo Cup final. Rivers Angels defeated the same opponent in last year’s final. Falode, who watched the final live in Yenagoa, commended the coach Godwin Okon-tutored Angels for going the extra mile to prove to Nigerians that they were the better team. “The two teams have shown consistency from 2017 till date, and they are also in contention for the Nigeria Women Premier League Super Four, where the true winners of the 2018 league season will be determined after an abridged format. “I want to tell Nigerian football lovers that, they will see a more improved women’s football next season after the NWFL must have articulated the development partnership with the LaLiga Women’s Football Department.”
