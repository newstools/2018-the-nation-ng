Youths in Oto/Awori Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State have staged a peaceful protest to express their displeasure about the All Progressives Congress (APC) primary. The election was held at Ojo Constituency 2. The protesters, led by youths under the aegis of Bibiire Youth Volunteers (BYV), alleged that the exercise was marred by violence and rigging. They appealed to the APC National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and others to declare one of the aspirants, Bolaji Kayode Roberts, (aka Bibiire), as the winner. The Coordinator of BYV, Adegboyega Olugbogi, alleged that one of the nine aspirants, Mr. Surajudeen Tijani Olatunji, (aka.Emir), brought hoodlums, who disrupted the exercise when he realised that defeat was imminent. Olugbogi alleged that Surajudeen, the financial secretary of Okada and Motorcycle Riders Association (NNAMORAL), an arm of the Road Transport Employers Association of Nigeria (RTEAN),invited the Lagos State Chairman of NNAMORAL, Alhaji Sulaimon Raji Adeshina, (aka Jafo Authority), who mobilised arms-wielding thugs that stormed Ilogbo-Elegba Primary School where the Ward ‘F’ primary election was held. Surajudeeen described the allegation as untrue, saying leaders were witnesses to his victory. An APC leader in Oto/Awori, Samuel Olaitan, urged the party to avoid scenarios that may make it suffer defeat in the general election. Two of the protesters, Usman Lawal, a member of the Arewa community and Mrs. Omileke Mustapha, a party member, said residents supported Roberts because he provided amenities and empowered youths through employment when he was the council chairman. A former Deputy Coordinator of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Comrade Ayantuga Adetola, advised the APC leadership to intervene, saying: “What we want is justice.”
