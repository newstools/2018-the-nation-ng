The High Level Women Advocates (HILWA),  a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) in Kebbi, says on Thursday that 10 per cent of schools age girls are still out of the schools in the state. The state Chairperson of HILWA, Hajiya Maimuna Bala, told newsmen in Birnin Kebbi that unless urgent interventions were made, most of these girls would be exposed to greater risks. “Ten percentages of primary aged girls are still out of school, many were not able to progress to secondary school and still need support to develop skill in literary and numeracy. “Most of these disadvantaged girls are in rural areas and needed humanitarian services while others with various disabilities lacked access to descent work. “Education and skilled workers are in great demand but roughly a quarter neither of young people most of them female are currently employed nor in education or training,” she lamented. Bala added that the members of the NGO have been going from one village to another in the state to enroll girl- children into schools, adding that such children would be sponsored to complete tertiary institutions. The chairperson called on state government and well-to-do individuals to help the organization in its quest to ensure the enrolment of more girl-children into schools. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that members of the NGO include, retired civil servants, successful business women and technocrats from across the 21 local government areas of the state.
