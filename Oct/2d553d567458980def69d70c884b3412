The Army has begun a clamp down on residents of Dura community over the disappearance of Maj.-Gen. Idris Alkali (rtd). A resident said over 200 residents, majorly youths, were arrested by men of the 3 Division between Tuesday night and yesterday morning. He added that those arrested were tortured to confess or volunteer information that will lead to Gen. Alkali’s killers. He said: “As a matter of fact, the military is already occupying the community, the operation started in the night. We woke in the morning to see soldiers surround the entire community in a way that says everyone is in danger. “Most of them were stripped naked and flogged inside a military truck. The soldiers came from Maxwell Khobe Cantonment, Rukuba Barrack, Jos.” Local sources say dozens of military personnel stormed the remote community at daybreak, arresting anyone in sight including women. The soldiers forced their subjects to surrender and board a military truck wherein they were stripped naked and taken to detention, it was learnt. Deputy Director, Army Public Relations, 3 Armoured Division Col. Kayode Ogunsanya, who confirmed the invasion, in a text message, said: “The Army is on a mission to find the missing Maj.-Gen. Idris Alkali (rtd), whose vehicle was discovered in a pond near the community. “I cannot tell you the number of people arrested, but it is normal that when we conduct such operations, some people will be apprehended. They were screened and sorted out based on their degree of involvement in the crime. The general area of Dura-Du district in Jos South has been cordond off. The aim is to search for the missing Gen. Alkali (rtd) dead or alive.” The military operations in the community has created serious fears in neighbouring communities, with many praying that the state will not get the Odi and Zakibiam experience during Obansanjo’s administration.
