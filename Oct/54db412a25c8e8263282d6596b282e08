Mirrors in a Trailer, Truck, Bus, Car, Tricycle, Motorcycle or Bicycle are like a second eye to the Driver or Rider. It, therefore, implies that any Driver or Rider, whose vehicle has no requisite mirrors cannot see well thereby constituting a safety risk on the road. After a tour of several places in Lagos, Abuja, Sokoto, Katsina, Benin and Bauchi States, I noticed a very dangerous trend, most of the Motorcycles had no side Mirrors, a very few had  mirror on only one side while a very tiny percentage had mirror on both sides. Out of the very little percentage that had 2 or 1 mirror, majority of the Riders did not set the mirrors for use. Considering the fact that Motorcycles are increasingly being used for commercial transportation in many parts of Nigeria, there is a need for the Governments and the Associations for the Riders to be up and doing in the following areas to ensure Standards of the motorcycles and Safety of the Riders and Passengers: Enough of sit – down look. Since there seems to be no alternative to the use of Motorcycles and Tricycles in all the parts of the 36 States and the Federal Capital Territory, the Federal, state and local governments and their relevant agencies as well as the association of riders must rise up to the occasion and take proactive measures towards ensuring the safety of irreparable lives on the roads.
