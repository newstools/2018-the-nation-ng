Ahead of Tuesday’s AFCON 2019 match day four fixture against the Mediterranean Knights of Libya, Super Eagles stand-in captain, Ahmed Musa has said the team remains well committed to ensure they gain maximum points in Tunisia, AOIFootball.com reports. The Al-Nassr striker, who spoke to Aoifootball.com before the Eagles departed for Tunis, further urged Nigerians to continue to support the team in prayers, as they aim to return the country back to the continental stage for the first time in six years. “We know the importance of this match already and we want to try and take all three points so that we can boost our chances of qualifying from the group. Everybody is happy and I’m confident we can get the win on Tuesday. “I believe if we play to the coach’s instructions just like we did in Uyo on Saturday, we can defeat them again. We know it won’t be an easy game but we are fully ready to defend the green and white of Nigeria,” Musa concluded. Musa is yet to lose a game as the Eagles’ captain and will be hoping to make it three wins in three when they face third on the log, Libya in Sfax on Tuesday night.
