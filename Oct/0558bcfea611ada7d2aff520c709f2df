Brazil has named a 23-man squad for friendlies against Uruguay and Cameroon – the latter of which is to be played at MK Dons’ ground, Stadium MK. Neymar, Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino have all been named in Tite’s side ahead of the November international break. Gabriel Jesus, Willian, Fabinho, Richarlison, Alisson and Ederson also feature. Brazil meets Uruguay at Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium on November 16 before heading north of London to Milton Keynes four days later. The 30,500-seater stadium that usually plays host to League Two football but will welcome the World Cup quarter-finalists for their match against Cameroon. MK Dons chairman Pete Winkelman said: ‘It is a real privilege for the community of Milton Keynes to welcome Brazil, one of the greatest national football teams of all time, and reigning African Cup of Nations champions Cameroon to Stadium MK. ‘We are all looking forward to hosting this magnificent sporting event here in November.’ Brazil were defeated 2-1 by Belgium at the quarter-final stage of the World Cup last summer but Tite remained in his role as manager. They have won all four of their games following the tournament in Russia, against USA (2-0), El Salvador (5-0), Saudi Arabia (2-0) and Argentina (1-0) in Saudi Arabia, where they were awarded the Superclasico Cup.
