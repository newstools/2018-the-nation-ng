In its bid to promote entrepreneurial activities among vulnerable women towards self reliance, Lagos State government, through the Ministry of Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, has empowered over 600 women with free skill acquisition training and start-up packs in 3 local government areas namely: Alimosho, Apapa and Yaba local government areas. Speaking at the closing ceremony of the Short-Term Skill Acquisition Programme, held in Alimosho council area, the Commissioner for Women Affairs and Poverty Alleviation, Dr. Lola Akande, said the state government is aware of the prevailing economic circumstance which poses serious challenges to women. “This informed the creation of 17 functional Skills Acquisition Centres across the five divisions of the State where various forms of over 17 skills are offered on a tuition- free basis,” she said. According to Akande, the main objective is to train women, girls and men alike in various skills and vocations for the purpose of economic empowerment and lifting of their status from the state of dependency to self reliance. “I am happy to say that beneficiaries of our short term vocational training who are mainly vulnerable women are now contributing to family and societal development,” she added. The commissioner was represented by a Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Mrs. Abiola Liadi
