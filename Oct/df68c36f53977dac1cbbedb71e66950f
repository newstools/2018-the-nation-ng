President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday received meeting proceedings of the National Minimum Wage Negotiation Tripartite Committee from the organised labour. The document submitted to the President at the State House contained proceedings of all the meetings the Committee had including the resolution to have N30,000 as new minimum wage. It was also gathered that the Presidency had demanded for the proceedings of the negotiation team when labour embarked on strike immediately the Federal Government suspended sine die the negotiation meeting. It was gathered that the document also contained the resolution in which N30,000 was agreed as the proposed new minimum wage. A reliable source said that the organised labour told the federal government to stop being the mouth piece of state governors in the negotiation. The NLC is threatening to embark on strike on the 6th of November if the issues are not resolved.
