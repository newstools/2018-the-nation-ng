Plateau State Commissioner for Information Yakubu Dati has berated the People Democratic Party (PDP) for protesting against the victory of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during the recent local government elections. Dati told reporters in Lagos at the weekend that the elections were adjudged free and fair by all the stakeholders and the civil society groups that monitored the exercise and wondered why the party should protest against an exercise adjudged transparent by most stakeholders and observers. This was coming after Governor Solomon Lalong inaugurated the chairmen of the 11 local government councils who were declared winners of the election at the Plateau State Government House, Jos. Dati attributed the protests to the “troublemaking” legacy of PDP. He advised the party to take advantage of the available legal means to resolve their grievances. He said: “I know that genuine people who are democrats, who know that in every contest there must be a winner and a loser, will take advantage of the tribunal set up by the government, which is an independent arm of government, to present their grievances and it will be looked at. “Resorting to self-help does not help. You also know that the elections were conducted peacefully all over the state. But, of course, what do you expect from PDP? They are an opposition and they believe that opposition means creating fear and anxiety in the hearts of people which is far from the ethos of democracy.” The commissioner attributed the large turnout of voters at the polls to the confidence the public has in the Plateau State Independent Electoral Commission.
