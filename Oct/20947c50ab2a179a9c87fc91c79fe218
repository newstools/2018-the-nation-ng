Seaport terminal operators have accused the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) of denying them the 25 per cent statutory charge of the value of auctioned containers at the ports. The operators, who condemned the impunity and lack of transparency by Customs in the auction exercise, lamented that for several years, Customs has failed to keep to the agreement, which mandated it to pay them, a 25 per cent charge from the value of all auctioned containers in the country. Spokesman of STOAN, Bolaji Akinola, said container terminals incur huge costs associated with the handling of overtime containers especially with the positioning of containers selected by Customs for auctioning without any commensurate benefit even after such containers are auctioned. His word: “Usually, it is after they (Customs) sell auctioned containers that they are supposed to pay the statutory 25 percent. But for years that they have been moving containers to Ikorodu, they have not paid us the statutory 25 per cent of the auction value. “It costs about $10 to lift a container once. For example, we may have to move seven or more containers to get to the one requested by Customs for auction and this comes at a huge cost. So it is causing big operational cost for us.”
