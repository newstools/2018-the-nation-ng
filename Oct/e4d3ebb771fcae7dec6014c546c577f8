Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential candidate has donated N10 million to the victims of the pipeline fire which killed scores of people at Umuaduru and Umuimo communities, Osisioma Ngwa council area, Abia State. Atiku, who was represented by his running mate, Mr. Peter Obi, said he was saddened by the incident and consoled the families of those who lost their lives. “Our presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, is out of the country. He would have been here by himself; he insisted that we must come to sympathize with our people. We commiserate with the Governor, the people of Abia state, Osisioma Ngwa council and the families who lost their loved ones in the incident. Continuing Obi said, “When we were riding to the community, the governor said the government should check the quality of pipes being used and how to secure the pipeline to avoid a recurrence. We will join hands to fix our land so that we won’t record such incident again”. Gov. Ikpeazu, while expressing gratitude for visit and donation of money, pledged to offset the hospital bills of the victims and urged those who were yet to access medical attention to do so without further delay. The governor also promised to help rehabilitate those who suffered losses in the incident to enable restart their businesses and directed the Commissioner for Health to ensure that the victims are taken of at the hospital. “I want to seize this opportunity to appeal to those who ran away and those at traditional homes should come out to access medical attention. Let them present themselves to the hospitals. Those who have been rendered orphans and those who lost their properties and businesses will be assisted. We are determined to provide succor and help for those who are alive. We cannot replace everything, but we try to make the situation a little bit bearable.”
