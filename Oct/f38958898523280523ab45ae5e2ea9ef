The Lagos State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Hyginus Omeje, has blamed articulated vehicle drivers for not considering bad roads while behind the wheel. He said they are expected to obey traffic rules that will guarantee other road users’ safety. Omeje, responding to questions yesterday on Faaji FM 106.5, Lagos on the factors responsible for crashes involving trucks and ways to curb them, said bad roads and poor condition of vehicles were responsible for high rate of accidents. He said drivers must plan their journey in accordance with the conditions of the roads, noting that the government was doing its best to rehabilitate roads. Omeje said the majority of the vehicles were not roadworthy, adding: “Despite this, drivers overload such vehicles and over speed.” He urged them to stop driving under the influence of alcohol, saying they should not drive when they are tired or feeling sleepy. The commander hailed the Federal Government for awarding roads for construction.
