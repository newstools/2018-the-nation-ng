Lagos State Government has established a special team to ensure traffic compliance and address disobedience of traffic rules. Chief Executive Officer of Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) AIG Chris Olakpe (retd), who spoke yesterday after a tour of traffic prone areas, in company of top hierarchy of the agency, including the General Manager, Mr. Olawale Musa, said the development was part of efforts to tackle gridlock. The team, according to him, comprised the Police, LASTMA, Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and men from military formations, to maintain physical presence and ensure compliance at traffic troubled spots. He hoped the officers would bring their experience and professionalism to bear and complement the efforts of officials on ground. Olakpe said their duty was to ensure efficiency in traffic control and enforcement of traffic laws. He said LASTMA would prosecute motorists who flouted traffic laws and assured residents that the agency remained committed to ensuring efficient traffic control. The LASTMA boss said no stone would be left unturned in the management of traffic and enforcement of traffic laws. “A radical problem requires a radical solution. Therefore, I want to state clearly that any motorist caught violating the law will face the full wrath of the law. Let me take this opportunity to appeal to the public to ensure orderliness on the roads,” he said. According to him, owners of articulated vehicles impounded at Apapa earlier this week for obstruction and 36 vehicle owners apprehended for driving against the traffic will soon be arraigned. Olakpe enjoined traffic officers to be more dedicated and work within the ambit of the law, saying it had become imperative, especially now that repair and rehabilitation of roads were in top gear.
