A Federal High Court in Lagos has sentenced a 42-year-old businessman, Chris Ani, to four years imprisonment for drug trafficking. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arraigned Ani before Justice Ayokunle Faji. He pleaded not guilty when he was arraigned on May 24, but later opted to change his plea. Delivering judgment on Friday,Justice Faji held that Section 11 (a) of the NDLEA Act stipulates a maximum punishment for the offence, noting that as a first offender, same should not be imposed on him. Aniâ€™s four years jail term would begin from the date of his arraignment. The court ordered that his international passport be forfeited to the Federal Government, adding that the Nigeria Immigration Service should be notified of the judgment. Justice Faji directed that the drug exhibit be destroyed by the NDLEA after the expiration of the appeal period. The convict was said to have committed the offence on March 5. According to the prosecution, he was arrested at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport during the inward clearance of a flight from Brazil. The prosecutor, Mrs Juliana Iroabuchi, said about 380g of cocaine was recovered from a music disk pack where he concealed the drug.
