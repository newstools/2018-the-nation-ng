Akwa Ibom Youth League has commended Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel for his efforts in addressing the interest of civil servants. The group spoke against the background of the survey of state governments by Non-Governmental Organisation BudgIT, which listed states owing workers salaries and pensioners’ entitlements. Akwa Ibom is not on the list of debtor-states. The group urged the governor not to rest on his oars, charging him to continue to clear gratuities of civil servants that were left unpaid by the former administration. “The BudgIT survey goes a long way to further authenticate the claims of the state government on its commitment to workers’ welfare. “Yes, we are not unaware of the difficult challenge that the state government has faced especiallyas regards the Irrevocable Standing Payment Orders (ISPOs) entered into by the preceding administration. “We note that despite the challenges that Governor Emmanuel faces, “The fact that no worker or pensioner is owed in Akwa Ibom State as authenticated by the BudgIT survey helps to clarify the lies been made by some political figures to confuse the people “It is gratifying that BudgIT has clarified the issue and we call on our politicians to desist from telling lies about workers welfare and rather focus on other topical issues that would help to raise the standard of governance in the state.”
