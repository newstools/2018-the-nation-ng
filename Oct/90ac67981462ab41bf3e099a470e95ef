The battle for Kwara Central senatorial seat in February next year promises to be a tough one for Senate President Bukola Saraki. According to details of the polls released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the Senate President, who is billed to fly the flag of the Peoples Democratic Party in the election, will have to slug it out with 16 other candidates of various political parties. His rivals in the February 16, 2019 election will include the candidates of All Progressives Congress (APC) and Africa Democratic Congress (ADC) as well as those of 14 other political parties, four of which are women. The four women seeking the Kwara Central Senatorial seat with Saraki are  Abubakar Khadijat Akanni of  MPN, Okanlawon Adekunle Taiwo of GPN, AbdulWaheed Mariam Titilayo of  ADP and AbdulSalam Kuburat of LP.

Ajimobi squares up with Akanbi, Folarin contends with Sunmonu in Oyo Popular names appeared yesterday on the list of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the race for the three Oyo State senatorial seats. On the list for Oyo South Senatorial District were the incumbent, Senator Adesoji Akanbi, who is running on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) and the incumbent governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, who is running on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Akanbi was elected on the APC platform in 2015. He defected to ADC in September when he discovered that Governor Ajimobi had obtained the form for his seat. While he hails from Ibadan North West Local Government Area, Ajimobi hails from Ibadan South West Local Government Area. Also contending for the same seat from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is Mr Adebayo Lawal while Mr Fola Akinosun is angling for it on the platform of African Democratic Party (ADP). In Oyo Central District, former Senate Leader Teslim Folarin of APC will slug it out with the incumbent, Senator Monsurat Sunmonu. The latter was also elected on the platform of the APC in 2015 but defected to ADC recently. Folarin picked the APC ticket this time. He defected from the PDP earlier in the year. PDP fielded Mr Oyebisi Ilaka while ADP fielded the current member, House of Representatives for Lagelu/Akinyele Federal Constituency, Hon. Olatoye Temitope Subaru. In Oyo North, the incumbent, Senator Fatai Buhari of APC will slug it out with PDP’s Hon. Mulikat Akande-Adeola, ADC’s Adeleke Lawal Adebayo and ADP’s Ahmed Salawudeen. Akande-Adeola is a former Majority Leader, House of Representatives.
