Ahead of Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against South Africa, Gernot Rohr is keeping a close watch on the Super Eagles’ players and has hinted that he will name a roster comprising 23 ‘strongest players’. On the back of three consecutive wins, the Super Eagles sit at the summit of their Africa Cup of Nations qualifying group and even a point from their last two games will see them qualify for next year’s tournament in Cameroun. ”As always, we will follow our players and their performances for their clubs until the next international break comes around,” Rohr said to Kick Off Magazine. ”Everyone is back at their clubs now and will play their games, and then we will once again try to select the 23 strongest players. ”Unfortunately, we will miss one of our strongest ones in Wilfred Ndidi after he picked up a [second] yellow card and is now suspended. ”He is a very important player for us, but we will try to make the strongest selection, which is always based on the form of our players. ”Of course, we also consider how they played and trained with us in camp.”
