Determined to ensure that the youth explore opportunities in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector, Ogun State Governor Senator Ibikunle Amosun has opened the Gateway ICT Polytechnic application development centre. The centre, which focuses on software and mobile application development, was inuagurated during the institution’s second convocation. Representing the governor at the event, Commissioner for Education, Modupe Mujota, said the government would work to ensure that the institution achieve its goals through partnership with global players in mobile application development. She said: “We are expecting the newly commissioned centre to bring out the creativity of our youths. We are also going to connect the school with globally acclaimed tech firms, which have links and capacity, such as Google to look at what we are doing here.” Speaking on what necessitated the centre, the rector, Dr Isaiah Oyeyinka, said the aim was to train undergraduates, who will be independent, imbibe entrepreneurial spirit and become self-reliant. He said: “Not only that we will train people on apps development, we will also do technology incubation and nourish tech companies to grow before we release them to the society. We took the cue from places like America where they incubate their technology and that is why there are great things coming forward from such a place.” Dr Oyeyinka said the polytechnic remained committed to providing quality teaching in engineering, science and technology, and ICT within the mandate of the national policy on education and subject to regulations of the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).
