The Anambra State government has refuted reports that two persons from Togo died in the recent collapsed building in the state. The Commissioner for Housing, Mr Emeka Ezenwanne, made the clarification at the Nnamdi Azikiwe Teaching Hospital, Nnewi, where victims were receiving treatment. He said only one Togolese died in the incident. He said the second Togolese, rumoured to be among the dead, was alive and receiving treatment at the hospital. A three-storey building under construction at Okpuno Otolo, Nnewi, collapsed on October 17, killing two persons. Nine others trapped in the rubbles were rescued alive. Ezenwanne regretted that the death rumour of the foreigner went viral on the social media, saying one of the victims was a Nigerian. “He was seen on his bed but still groaning under severe pains with some other survivors from the building collapse,” he said. Describing the incident as unfortunate, Ezenwanne, who visited the site of the collapsed building with his entourage, said the visit was to encourage the survivors. He prayed for their quick recovery and pledged financial support for their treatment. The commissioner sympathised with relatives of the deceased. The surviving Togolese, identified simply as Mr Collins, thanked the commissioner for his visit and support.
