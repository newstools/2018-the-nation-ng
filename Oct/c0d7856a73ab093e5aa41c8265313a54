Visionscape Sanitation Solutions is contracted by the Lagos State government to provide residential solid waste management collection services, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), John Irvine, has said. Irvine, responding to the House of Assembly directive to the Private Sector Partnership (PSP) operators to go back to refuse packing, said: “We are aware of statements being attributed to the House of Assembly concerning cancellation of our service contract with the Lagos State government. “We would like to believe that there is some misinterpretation of the statements being circulated, despite our continued efforts in meeting the performance matrices of our valid and subsisting contract. “We will nonetheless continue to fulfil the terms of our service contract in the face of a sustained negative sponsored media campaign, as well as persistent and systematic sabotage of our efforts and our assets. “We remain open to dialogue, levelling the competitive playing field and participating in a more inclusive process with stakeholders in the environment.”
