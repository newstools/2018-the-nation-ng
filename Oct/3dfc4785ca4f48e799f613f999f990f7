The Ooni of Ife,Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, on Thursday night, received his new wife at the palace. Olori Moronke Naomi Silekunola Ogunwusi,an evangelist, was ushered into the palace by elderly women 24 hours after the Ooni turned 44 years. Oba Ogunwusi took to the social media to personally confirm the development. “I waited patiently upon the Almighty the King of kings, he eventually did it in the midst of many trials,” he said on Twitter. He added:”Shilekunola, Moronke, Naomi; the greatest Arsenal you can apply on this highly revered throne with many rules and regulations in the midst of undiluted tradition, heritage and culture is the “Fear of God In You.” “It is the beginning of your wisdom on this throne of Oduduwa. You are welcome home my beautiful and adorable queen.” The Director, Media and Public Affairs at the palace, Mr. Moses Olafare,said separately that the marriage rights were done privately in Akure, Ondo State before she moved to Ile-Ife for the remaining part of the marriage.
