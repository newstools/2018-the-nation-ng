There is palpable fear of imminent death lurking in Umuinwere and Amaukwu villages in Obokwe in Ukwa West Local Government Area of Abia State following a leakage on the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) pipeline (Kms 38 to 43) suspected to be Petroleum Motor Spirit (PMS). Recall that Umuimo, Umuaduru and Uratta communities in Osisioma Local Government Area of the state have suffered loss of their indigenes from pipeline explosions that recently rocked the three communities. It was learnt that the people of the area had been living in fear after reported efforts to alert concerned authorities over the matter failed. Yet-to-be confirmed reports have it that unscrupulous persons from and outside the communities have been going to the leaking pipeline to scoop petroleum product while exposing their lives and that of the communities to danger. But the state government through the Commissioner for Petroleum Barr. Chizuru Kanu has reportedly warned the general public, particularly residents and visitors in Obokwe area to stay away from the affected pipeline to avoid any disaster. In a release signed by Kanu, he called on relevant security agencies and officials of NNPC to immediately ensure the cordoning off of the area as well as prevention of unauthorized activities. The release further advised the management of NNPC to mobilize necessary resources and execute remedial actions along the affected areas of the pipeline as well as the entire length of the 143km length of pipeline across the state. The pipeline monitoring and protection unit of the NNPC is also advised to be more proactive in their operations to ensure that the ugly incident recently witnessed along the Osisioma axis of the pipeline does not happen again in the state.
