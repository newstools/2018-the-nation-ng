A group of former Sole Administrators  (SOLAD) in Lagos State yesterday denied receiving money from Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to vote for him in today’s primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The body, under the aegis of Conference 57 of Past Sole Administrators, described the allegation as “malicious and mischievous.” In a statement by Abiodun Taiwo, former Ikeja Local Government sole administrator, the group said it had at no time allowed monetary inducement by any aspirant to influence its decisions. Taiwo urged the public to disregard “such false information, as it’s the work of some sponsored politicians, whose intention is to tarnish the reputation of our group and discredit the party’s decision. “We strongly support the party’s decision as ardent political disciples of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. We refuse to be distracted from the wishes and decisions of our leader. “Should there be those who have truly collected any money on our behalf, they should kindly return same. We warn that no politician should soil the good name of sole administrators with any scandalous and detrimental act, as our choice is in tandem with that of our leader. We are determined to ensure victory for our party’s choice.” The group said it had endorsed Babajide Sanwo-Olu, adding:”We are going to work for his victory in the primary election.”
