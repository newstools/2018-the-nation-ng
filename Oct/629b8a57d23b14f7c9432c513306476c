A former Majority Leader of the Rivers State House of Assembly, Dr. Chidi Lloyd, has been appointed the director-general of Tonye Cole Campaign Organisation, ahead of the 2019 governorship election. Lloyd, PhD Law, from Emohua Local Government, will coordinate the campaigns of Cole and his running mate, Chief Victor Giadom, of All Progressives Congress (APC). The appointment was confirmed yesterday in a telephone interview by Rivers APC Publicity Secretary Chris Finebone. Governor Nyesom Wike sued Lloyd over the crisis in the Seventh Rivers Assembly, when attempts were made by five lawmakers to impeach then Speaker Otelemaba Dan Amachree, But the ex-Law teacher at Rivers State University (RSU), Port Harcourt declared that he remained innocent of the allegation and he would never be intimidated, while remaining focused to ensure victory for APC and its candidates during next yearâ€™s polls.
