Suspected cultists have killed four people in Diobu, Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital. There was confusion in the area. Residents were thrown into mourning. The incidents occurred between 4am on Monday and 8:15am yesterday. Two persons, a woman and a middle-aged man, were reportedly killed around Mechanic garage, near St. Thomas Church, Ikoku junction, Mile II Diobu. Two members of a vigilance group were murdered at Lumuba/Emenike and Nanka streets, all in Diobu. A source said the woman, who was a gin seller, was shot dead during a gun battle by twoÂ cults. The source said the woman was killed when a cultist ran to where she was selling gin to shield himself from bullets. The incident paralysed commercial activities. Shops and houses were shut for fear of arrest by security operatives, who stormed the area. The police confirmed that the fight was cult related, saying peace had been restored. Two vigilantes were killed at Mile 2, Diobu last month.
