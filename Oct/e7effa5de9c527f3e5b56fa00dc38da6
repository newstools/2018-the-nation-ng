Raw materials The raw material i.e Roselle Calyces is grown in commercial quantities especially in the northern part of Nigeria. Table 1 shows some states and local government areas in Nigeria where Roselle is readily available in commercial quantity. Other additives/preservatives are readily available in Nigerian industrial raw materials markets. Machinery and equipment The major machinery and equipment for Zobo drink production and preservation include: Zobo extractor, Pasteurizer, Filter-Mixer, transfer pump, Holding tank, Shrink wrapper, and accessories. The cost depends on the capacity which could vary from 500L/day to 5,000L/day. Small scale zobo drink production plant Process technology The basic unit operations in Zobo production and preservation are: The Roselle Calyces are thoroughly cleaned to remove dirt. The ingredients i.e. the leaves and the preservatives are weighed appropriately. The weighed calyces are washed and allowed to drain. The washed calyces are blanched in boiling water for extraction. The filtrate is strained after extraction using muslin cloth. The additives and sweetener are added appropriately. The additives and sweetener are properly mixed. The drink is filtered and transferred to the holding tank. The filtered drink is filled into appropriate packaging material. The bottled drink is pasteurized at appropriate temperature over a period of time. The drinks are allowed to cool after which the bottles are labeled. Cartooning The bottles are shrink-wrapped in cartons ready for sales.
