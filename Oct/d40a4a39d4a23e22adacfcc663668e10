Super Eagles Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr is in Asaba to inspect the Stephen Keshi Stadium, to see if the venue could host international matches, according to NFF president Amaju Pinnick. Pinnick told the NFF Annual General Assembly in Asaba on Wednesday, that besides watching Aiteo Cup final between Kano Pillars and Enugu Rangers, Rohr was in Asaba to see if the Stephen Keshi Stadium could host Eagles matches. The stadium has already staged the African Athletics Championships earlier this year. The Eagles have mainly played their matches at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium in Uyo.
