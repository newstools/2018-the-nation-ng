FORMER members of the National Assembly from the Southeast geo-political zone have hailed the choice of former Anambra State Governor Peter Obi as the running mate to the Peoples Democratic Party’s  (PDP) presidential candidate, former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. The former federal lawmakers said Obi is eminently qualified for the job. Some leaders from the region complained against Obi’s selection by Atiku, saying that they were not consulted before the decision taken. The former lawmakers however, said widespread consultations are ongoing that would be beneficial to the region. Speaking with reporters in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT),  the ex-lawmakers, while expressing their support for Atiku’s choice, said Obi’s emergence is in the interest of Southeast and Nigeria The lawmakers include  Ogbuefi Ozomgbachi,  Chuma Nzeribe, Mayor Eze, Chudi Uwazuruike,  Rufus Omire, Offor Chukwuegbu, Kalu Uduma, Agwu Nnachi and Senator Paulinus Igwe-Nwagu. Ozomgbachi said there was no need for the unhealthy controversy  generated by Obi’s nomination. He added: “We wish to categorically state that the greatest challenge facing us as a nation is the removal of the current APC regime and the enthronement of an all-inclusive government committed to good governance, adherence to federal character principles and restructuring which the PDP and Atiku/Obi ticket represent.”
