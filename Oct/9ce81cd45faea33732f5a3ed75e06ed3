The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akure North Local Government Area of Ondo State has said they were satisfied with the emergence of Abiodun Faleye as the party’s flag bearer for its state constituency. The leaders of the party in Akure North stated this in a communique signed by 11 ward chairmen after their emergency meeting on Thursday in Oba Ile,Akure. The communique was signed by Mrs Olufunke Adu, Vice Chairman, APC, Akure North, and Gbenga Fadeyi, Secretary, APC Akure North. Others signatories were Mrs Serifat Adepoju, Women Leader, APC Akure North and Isaac Lawal, Youth Leader of the party in the region. The Chairman of the party in the area had described the candidature of Faleye as an imposition, calling for Dele Ologun to be recognized by the national body. The communique noted that it would be unfair to other communities from the region, if the House of Assembly candidate and the Local Government Chairman emerged from the same ward out of 12 wards in the area. It observed that the party primary conducted in the local government reflected the wishes of the generality of the party members, where  Abiodun Faleye won the primary with 7,947 votes as against Dele Ologun’s 2,742. The party supporters therefore urge the national chairman of our great party comrade Adams Oshiomole, the state chairman,Ade Adetimehin, party leaders and the general public to disregard the statement as signed by Joshua Eleti,chairman of the party in the council. One of the leaders at the meeting,who is the commissioner for Youths and Sports, Saka Yusuf-Ogunleye, said there were two APC groups in the council area which had agreed to work together for the interest of the party. Yusuf-Ogunleye said a decision was reached that the two elective positions; council chairman and house of assembly be shared,adding that the position of councillors was also agreed to be shared between the groups equally.
