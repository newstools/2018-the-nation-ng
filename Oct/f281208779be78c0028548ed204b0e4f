Egg is vital to brain development, Director-General Consumer Protection Council (CPC) Babatunde Irukere has said. He spoke yesterday to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos at an event organised to celebrate the World Egg Day and the inauguration of Egg Sellers and Distributors Association of Nigeria. Irukere, represented by Carmellus Anyanwu, the councilâ€™s head of Surveillance and Disbursement, said egg was a key component of national economy. He said the inauguration of the association was a call to duty, urging members to collaborate with poultry farmers and other stakeholders, as egg was a delicate and perishable product. Irukere expressed the commitment of the council to encourage trade associations. He enjoined members to work with global best practices. The National President of the association, Mrs. Olaide Grahams, said it would coordinate, motivate and pursue participation of all involved in the trade.
