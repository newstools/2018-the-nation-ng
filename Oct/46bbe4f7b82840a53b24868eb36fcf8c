The Chief Medical Director (CMD), Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH), Idi-Araba, Lagos, Prof. Chris Bode, has urged health professionals to promote teamwork, to ensure quality health care delivery. He addressed reporters yesterday at the 2018 Joint Graduation Ceremony and Presentation of Prizes of LUTH Schools in Lagos. Prof. Bode said: “In the health care system, everybody is important; the less we emphasise our differences, the better service we will deliver to our patients. “We should endeavour to always promote team spirit. It is those who benefit from the politics that actually emphasise differences. “I am a good surgeon, but I cannot be a good nurse. Should we then say a nurse or a pharmacist is not important? “An eye specialist needs an eye nurse; an ophthalmologist needs an ophthalmic nurse and a paediatric surgeon will need a paediatric surgical nurse.’’ The guest of honour, Prof. Cecilia Igwillo, hailed LUTH management and tutors for producing specialised health professionals in the health care system. Igwillo, represented by Dr. Aderemi Williams, advised the graduating students to adopt good attitude and discipline that would portray them as an ambassador of the institution, as well as the nation. Dr. Olufemi Fasanmade, LUTH chairman, Medical Advisory Committee (CMAC), said 399 students graduated from the schools, which included the School of Nursing, School of Health Information Management and School of Medical Laboratory Science. Others are School of Midwifery, School of Community Health, Opthalmic School and School of Dental Health, amongst others.
