The Anambra South senatorial aspirant on the platform of the All progressive Congress APC, Sir Azuka Okwuosa, says they will not allow anybody from the people’s Democratic Party PDP to destroy their party because of selfish interest. Okwuosa, while briefing reporters yesterday in Awka, said he does not believe the party had done it’s primaries in Anambra South senatorial zone, adding that he was still waiting for the electoral panel. He said some people who destroyed PDP had joined APC with the same mindset, adding that since that time the had not been moving forward in Anambra. The front line APC aspirant alleged that the presence of such people like Uba were cancerous to the party, adding that their plans were to destroy the party the way it is in PDP. Okwuosa said he obtained the senatorial form for Anambra South zone and was cleared by the party alongside Sen Andy Uba, adding that the party members had been waiting for the electoral panel without seeing anyone. He however, appealed to the party members to remain calm in all the 119 wards in Anambra South senatorial zone, adding that they still take it that nothing had happened. He said the issue of getting in touch with the party leadership was presumptuous, adding that what was being circulated on the social media could deceive people.
