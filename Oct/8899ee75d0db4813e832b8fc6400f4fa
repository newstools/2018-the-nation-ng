A group, Adamawa Youth for Change and Consolidation, has taken to President Muhammadu Buhari its protest against the postponement of the Adamawa State governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The group also questions the change of mode from indirect to direct primary, charging that some ‘Abuja politicians’ are behind everything and asking the president to call such politicians to order. The Sunday APC governorship primary was dogged by intrigues in Adamawa State and when it could not start by Monday morning, the national headquarters of the party announced a decision to postpone it to Thursday and to adopt direct instead of indirect primary initially planned for it. At a press briefing in Yola Tuesday morning, the Adamawa Youth for Change and Consolidation alleged that both the change in date and mode of conduct of the primary were influenced by the Abuja politicians intent on causing chaos in the Adamawa State APC. The Chairman of the group, Menan Kongo, who read to journalists an open letter the group addressed to Buhari, said the promoters of the aspiration of a politician close to Buhari were intimidating the APC at the National level using Buhari’s name, and that the influential politician had in the course of the botched Sunday primary threatened to call Abuja to postpone the primary which was ongoing after the accreditation of delegates. “We are using this medium to call on the president who is known for justice to come out and condemn the action of the people using his name for cheap political points,” Menan Kongo said.
