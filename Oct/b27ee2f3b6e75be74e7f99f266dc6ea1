THE Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice Abubakar Malami to without delay take over corruption cases involving  former and serving governors. The organisation regretted that the trial of several former state governors accused of corruption and money laundering have continued to linger in different high courts. It noted that some of the grand corruption cases involving former governors started in 2007 are yet to properly begin. “Should the Attorney General not take over the cases of corruption against all past corrupt governors as requested, SERAP would, on account of the public interest involved, and to ensure that no further time is lost in the completion of these cases, consider appropriate legal action to compel the authorities to discharge their constitutional duties, consistent with the basic tenet of the rule of law, the concept of equality and the cause of justice”, it warned. In a letter to the President, dated October 5, 2018 and signed by SERAP Deputy Director Timothy Adewale, the organisation expressed conEconomic cern that the continuing delay in the prosecution of former governors suspected of committing acts of grand corruption to logical conclusion has sent a negative message that the governors are untouchable. “The delay is also contributing to perception among Nigerians that many of these influential and powerful past governors are being protected by the power and political set up,” it stated. According to the organisation, “instructing the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice to take over and directly and expeditiously prosecute all cases of grand corruption involving former governors, would be entirely consistent with his duties under the Constitution, and contribute to upholding the majesty of law and vindicating the rule of law.”
