THE Facility for Oil Sector Transparency and Reform (FOSTER) in conjunction with the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) have called on President Muhammadu Buhari to give assent to the Petroleum Industrial Governance Bill (PIGB) and to make haste in looking into the other PIBs. They made this call during a one day workshop on PIB, organised for members of NUJ in the southern states held during the week at the Ibom Hotels and Golf Resort, Uyo. Speaking through a communique issued at the end of the workshop, which featured presentations by industry analysts and discussions, by participants, they came up with resolutions that President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to decline assent to the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) represents a setback to the buildup of momentum from 18 years of efforts to introduce policy reforms to the Nigerian Oil and Gas sector. “We call on the president and the National Assembly to swiftly resolve the contentious issues raised about the Bill,” it stated. The communique, which was signed by the National President, NUJ, Chris Isiguzo, and  National Secretary, Shuaibu Usman Leman, stated that the imperative to increase Nigeria’s competitiveness in the global energy market makes the need for reform urgent. “Actualization of the reform bills should be a national priority.”
