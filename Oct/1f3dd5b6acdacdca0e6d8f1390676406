The Federal Government has commenced moves to deploy underutilised power assets to deliver incremental power to industrial centres and needy communities in the country by generating additional 4.2 gigawatts of power to the national grid in the next 12-18months. A statement by the Strategy and Communications Adviser to the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Bisi Daniels, said the measure is to ensure optimal use of resources. The Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment, Okechukwu Enalema, said work is ongoing on the Alaoji power plant to supply about 360megawatts of unutilised power to industrial centres and people in the South-East Axis of Onitsha, Aba, Nnewi and Ihiala. He said: “Only 120Mw out of the 480Mw of power generated by the plant is regularly utilised, so 360Mw of power is available for centres willing and ready.”
