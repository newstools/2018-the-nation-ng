Ahead of the 2019 general elections, the Lagos State Police Command on Thursday said it would not tolerate clashes and street fights between political thugs in any part of the state. Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal again warned politicians to control their supporters vowing to prosecute  any politician whose supporters engaged in acts of violence, lawlessness. Edgal spoke at a town hall security summit aimed at ensuring a violent free election in the state held in Lagos Island. He said: “We cannot allow cultist groups to begin to fester hoping that they will receive patronage from politicians. Lagos is a cosmopolitan state, an elite environment so there is no room for thuggery in Lagos. “I am calling on politicians to abide by the rules. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has made it clear that any form of campaigns or political activities for presidency and National Assembly elections are to commence November 18. Not earlier than that. “While governorship election campaigns will commence on December 2. So, politicians and their supporters must be patient. Political activities will not commence under any guise before the scheduled dates. “We do not need to disguise campaigns in the name of thank you tour, or any other political activity before the stipulated time. Politicians should not go to public places and give money out. I am also advising that they should not give money out, because most of the troubles and killings that come up are usually because of money sharing.” According to Edgal, cultism has assumed a frightening dimension in the state, recalling the recent killings at Ikorodu Road during a politician’s ‘Thank you tour.’ “As stakeholders we must not take the issue of cultism with levity because it has the potential to dislocate the peace that we experience across the state. We will not allow people come from anywhere and heat up Lagos Island in the name of politics,” he re-emphasized.
