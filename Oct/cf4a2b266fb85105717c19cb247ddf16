The Social Democratic Party (SDP) in Cross River State has affirmed Mr Eyo Ekpo as its gubernatorial candidate for next year’s elections. Ekpo, a former Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice in the state, though the sole aspirant of the party, emerged through votes in direct primaries conducted across the 196 wards in the state. The election, which was supervised by the SDP governorship primary committee from the National, led by Dr Benson Ogbonna, was peaceful, as delegates cast their votes in the presence of security operatives and representatives of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Ekpo, who expressed gratitude for the mandate to be the governorship candidate of the party, said that the mission to recover and restore Cross River State was not negotiable. He said, “This statewide affirmation of my candidacy signifies the confidence you have in my ability to rescue Cross River from the downward spiral currently plaguing every sector. “It is the vision of the SDP to provide you people with the dividends of democracy and I pledge to do just that; recover and restore Cross River State. I urge you all to join me in this vision and make it our collective responsibility to rebrand our dear State.” He said the SDP was determined to sweep across the State to every household and community to get people especially the electorates on board. The State Chairman of the party, Eni Ikpi, expressed satisfaction with the turnout for the exercise across the state.
