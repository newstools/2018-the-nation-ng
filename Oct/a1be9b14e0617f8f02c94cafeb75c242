PARIS SAINT-GERMAIN forward Neymar Jr has ended his relationship with Brazilian actress Bruna Marquezine once again after she confirmed the split at a gala event in Brazil. The pair has had an on-off romance over the past six years but Marquezine revealed they had gone their separate ways again after a gala event in Brazil on Thursday. The 23-year-old wouldn’t go into details about the break-up but insisted it was not to do with publicized differences in political viewpoints and claimed they still had ‘a lot of love’ for one another. “It was a decision that came from him, but there is a lot of respect, a lot of love, for him and for everything that we have lived for,” she said in an interview. “You know I do not usually talk about my personal life. I’ll talk about it because I have to talk, but it will only be once”.
