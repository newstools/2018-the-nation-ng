the election monitoring team of the Inter-Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has petitioned the national leadership of the All Progressive Congress (APC) over its governorship primary elections in the Cross River State, calling for the cancellation of the entire process. The leader of the team, Comrade Kingsley Edet, in a statement made available to The Nation in Calabar yesterday alleged the election did not hold in over 84 wards of the 196 wards  in the state. According to the team, the exercise was marked by hijacking of materials as well as display of thuggery across the state. “An observer who gave reports from the Central District said he was almost killed when he questioned the disenfrachisement of one of the guber aspirant, Prof. Eyo Etim Nyong. “It was also observed that party membership registers were not available for use in almost all voting points. “We are calling on the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to, as a matter of urgency cancel the exercise. IPAC presented some picture documents of Ward 9, Calabar South as one amongst several others, whereupon a particular candidate who won on vote cast was not announced as winner in the said ward. We pray the NWC to critically look into all the issues the process has raised,” Edet said.
