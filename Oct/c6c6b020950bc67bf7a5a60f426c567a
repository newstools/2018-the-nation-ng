The aspirant contesting for the Ado Odo/ Ota federal constituency seat on the platform of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Honorable Abiodun Akinboyede has said that the party is not structured to accommodate godfatherism. He said “this is the first political party in the history of this country that will give youths and women the opportunity to contest for positions they desire”. The barrister added that the party had been canvassing before now that 10 per cent of political positions should be reserved for old ones among us because of their advanced experience. He said:”Godfatherism is the bane of our politics. It destroys party structures in Nigeria. While our people are tired of unfulfilled promises from the same set of politicians, ADC, as a party, has come at the right time to rescue not only Ogun State, but Nigeria from bad leadership”.
