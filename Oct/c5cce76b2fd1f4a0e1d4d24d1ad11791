I’m glad it has finally happened. There are lots of youths out there who needs just a little push of empowerment motivation and I feel fulfilled knowing that I can make an impact in such people’s lives. “I also want to seize the opportunity to thank the Director General of the NYSC, all the Directors and Deputy Directors and staff of NYSC who were present at the presentation. “To all our sponsors, facilitators and guests, we are really grateful for their consistent support. It has been an honour to partner with you to make the dreams of these young ones a reality,” she said. Beneficiaries promised to utilise the grants well.
