The Southwest leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to abide by the traditional culture of discipline, fair play, respect for order and equity in the affairs of the country. The party also warned that the nation’s democracy must not continue along what it called the “flawed, demeaning path”. The PDP was reacting to the manner the Ekiti and Osun states’ governorship elections were conducted. The party stated its position yesterday at a stakeholders’ meeting of Southwest leaders of the party in Ibadan, the state capital. The meeting was chaired by Chief Olabode George and attended by the Deputy National Chairman, Elder Yemi Akinwonmi; the zone’s Chairman, Eddy Olafeso; Oyo State governorship candidate, Seyi Makinde; Ekiti State Deputy Governor Prof Olusola Eleka and delegates from Southwest states.
