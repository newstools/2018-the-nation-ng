A journalist in Benin City, Edo State, Mr. Lucky Ighomuaye, has appealed to well meaning Nigerians to come to his aid to enable him treat his Wife, Mrs. Benedicta Ighomuaye, who is suffering from breast cancer. Ighomuaye said his wife has successfully undergone surgery at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, UBTH including her chemotherapies, but the doctor said she needed to repeat the process due to some complications to avoid further spread. The doctor who does not want her name in print, said it will require about N1,000,000 for another round of complete chemotherapy. “I spent all of my savings on the previous exercise and I am appealing to the Edo State government and other well meaning Nigerians to come to my assistance to enable me give her the needed treatments,” he said. He said he can be reached through this telephone number: 08058002402. Donations should be made to his account number Heritage Bank 5000434689.
