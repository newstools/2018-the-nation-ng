A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court in Abuja on Wednesday sentenced one 37-year-old Chukwu Ndukwu to four months’ imprisonment for stealing a N60,000 phone. The Judge, Mr Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave the convict an option of N7,000 fine, warning him to desist from bad behaviour. The convict had admitted committing the offence, and begged the court to temper justice with mercy. He blamed the stealing on the Devil. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Ijeoma Ukagha, told the court that Mr Suleiman Halilu of Garki 2, Abuja, reported the case at the Utako Police Station, Abuja, on October 4. Ukagha said that the convict and two others at large snatched Halilu’s Infinix Hot Note 6 from him when he stopped his car to rectify a fault. The prosecutor said that the police recovered the phone from the convict during an investigation.
