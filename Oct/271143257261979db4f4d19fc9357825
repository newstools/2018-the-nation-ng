Immediate past Speaker of the Edo State House of Assembly, Dr. Justin Okonoboh, has been named the new Deputy Speaker. Dr. Okonoboh emerged Deputy Speaker after the impeachment of Hon Victor Edoror. Edoror was made Speaker in 2015 and was impeached in 2016. He was made Deputy Speaker in 2017 when Dr. Okonoboh was removed as Speaker. Okonoboh was first elected Speaker in 2016 and removed in 2017 for financial recklessness. Both Edoror and Okonoboh hail from Edo Central Senatorial district.
