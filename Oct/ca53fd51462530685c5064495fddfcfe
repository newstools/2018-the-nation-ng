The Commander 055 Nigeria Air Force, Rasak Olanrewaju, has said the Force will partner Lagos State Fire Service in fire prevention and safety. A statement yesterday by the Fire Service Chief Public Affairs Officer, Bola Ajao, said Olanrewaju made this known during his visit to the Directorate of Fire Service in Alausa, Ikeja. According to him, the Lagos Fire Service has become a masterstroke due to its professionalism, effectiveness and swift response to distress calls, as well as control and management disasters. The visit, Olanrewaju said, was in recognition of the similarities between the two institutions in the areas of safety and security of the citizenry, as well as the attendant risk involved in the discharge of duties. “Recognising the similarities in our calling and risk involved, it behoves us to continue to foster closer relationships and synergy towards improving our operational capabilities,” he said. The commander thanked the fire service for putting out the fire at the Force’s Victoria Island, Lagos facility. He said he was impressed with the modern equipment on ground at the station and effective response of the firefighters to disaster calls. Lagos Fire Service Acting Director Rasaki Musibau said there was need for harmonious working relationship between the Fire Service and other security formations. This, he said, would improve productivity and prevent loss of lives and property. Musibau decried attacks on firefighters by street urchins and sought other security formations’ support on the protection of firefighters while performing duties. He urged motorists to give right of way to fire service vehicles on safety mission, “as delay can result in calamity.”
