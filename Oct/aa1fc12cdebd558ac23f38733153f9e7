Export of goods and raw materials from Nigeria to other African countries is a viable business and can rejig the country’s economy, create jobs for the youth population, strengthen existing small and medium scale local industries and give birth to new ones. This was the submission of an expert in export trade, Mrs. Ojuolape Kazeem, at the  second year anniversary of the Business Executive International(BEI) in Abeokuta, the Ogun state capital, who also lamented that the nation’s “weak system” hampering the growth of export businesses and attendant poor successes being recorded by operators. Kazeem who is the Chief Executive Officer of BEI, urged the federal government to urgently sign the Africa Free Trade Deal to ease export business within the country and between Nigeria and other African nations. She said withholding of signature on the deal is hurting franchising, which according to her has been in existence since 2001. “Signing the deal will help accelerate the ease of doing business in the country and among African countries,” she said. She further noted that the business environment of the country is not encouraging enough for both local and foreign investors, and appealed to the government to address the various challenges affecting the ease of doing business. Kazeem also expressed worry that the youth who form majority of the population, only show passive interest in legitimate means of making money, warning that lack of sustained efforts to invest in youths may spell doom for the country in the nearest future.
