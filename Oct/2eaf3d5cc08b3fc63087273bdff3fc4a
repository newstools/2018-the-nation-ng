As Nigeria celebrated its Independence Day yesterday, the International Federation of Women Lawyers (FIDA) and the National Orientation Agency (NOA) have called for an end to the killings in Plateau State. In separate interviews yesterday with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Jos, the state capital, the organisations expressed optimism that mutual respect would foster unity and forestall further killings in Plateau State and other parts of the country. FIDA’s Chairperson in Plateau State Mrs Mary Izam said Nigeria at 58 was worth celebrating but could further progress if Nigerians learnt to live in peace and harmony. She said: “Nigerians should refuse using religious and ethnic diversity to destabilise the nation. We want a new Nigeria where improving the quality of lives of the people is our major priority. “We condemn the killings of innocent lives in the recent attacks in Plateau and other parts of the country, as every life is sacred and valuable in this country.” The FIDA official also praised the security agencies for their tireless efforts in this critical period of the country. She called for more synergy between them and community leaders in addressing security matters. Izam also urged President Muhammadu Buhari to ensure the release of Leah Sharibu, the only girl still in captivity out of the 110 Dapchi schoolgirls abducted in February. The FIDA chairperson said she has a right to liberty as a Nigerian citizen. Also, the NOA director in Plateau State, Mr Bulus Dabit, said the drivers of crisis in the stae and other parts of the country were not religious people but persons with criminal intents. He said: “It is unfortunate how these miscreants easily mobilise the religiously inclined and responsible citizens to perpetrate their agenda in order to undermine our collective security.”
