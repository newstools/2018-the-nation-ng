A group, the International Charitable Initiative for Girl Child and Woman Development Foundation (ICI-GWODEF), has urged stakeholders to team up with the Federal Government to stop Boko Haram’s attacks. The President, Mrs. Helen Ibeji, in a statement yesterday in Lagos while reacting to the killing of Miss Hauwa Liman, an aide worker with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), by Boko Haram insurgents, condemned the killing. She asked the government to ensure those responsible for her death are prosecuted. “We cry and seek justice and compensation for the deceased’s family and other families who have lost their dear ones to the Boko Haram insurgents,” the body said. Mrs. Ibeji noted that humanitarian workers, especially the ICRC, who work in conflict zones, risk their lives to save humanity.
