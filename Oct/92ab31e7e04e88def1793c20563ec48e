Managing Director of the Oil and Gas Free Zones Authority (OGFZA) Obong Umana Okon Umana has reaffirmed his loyalty to the All Progressives Congress (APC). He spoke against the background of “a false, malicious and completely misleading story on the social media that he is contemplating defecting from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).” A statement by his spokesman Iboro Otongaran quoted Umana as denying a claim that he had concluded a plan to quit the ruling party adding that  “the author of the publication is known for publishing false stories to malign leaders in the state and impugn the integrity of other distinguished members of the society. “He is currently facing a serious criminal charge in a court in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, for false publication against Deputy Governor of the State Chief Moses Ekpo. Sometime last year, he was detained by the police for false publication. “Contrary to the false publication under reference, Umana is working assiduously with other leaders and members of his great party, the APC, to ensure the victory of the party at all levels in the upcoming elections. “This fact is clearly evident in the media coverage of Umana’s participation in party activities both in the state and at the national level.”
