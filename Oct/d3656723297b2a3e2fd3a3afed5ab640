A former Lagos House of Assembly member, who is seeking a return to the chamber, Abdoulbaq Ladi Balogun yesterday decried violence that characterised the primary election. Balogun is running for Ajeromi-Ifelodun Constituency II under the All Progressives Congress (APC). The ex-lawmaker said he polled 2,277 votes to defeat his rival Fatai Olatunji Oluwa, who got 893 votes. According to him, some people who were not happy with the results engaged hoodlums to disrupt the exercise. “They openly instructed the thugs to shoot-at-sight my supporters, who converge on the council secretariat to protect our votes and celebrate the landslide victory. In the melee, two of my brothers were injured. They are recuperating in the hospitals,” he said. He urged Alhaji Tunde Balogun-led party leaders in the state to ensure that his victory is not overturned. The will of the people, Balogun said, should not be subverted.
