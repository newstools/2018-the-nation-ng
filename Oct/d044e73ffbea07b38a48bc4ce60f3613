The Social Democratic Party (SDP), Adamawa State’s third most popular party after ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP), has received 11,500 members of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), including its state chairman, Mr Robinson Mathias. Mathias who led the defectors to a reception held for them at the SDP state Secretariat in Yola Friday, said their decision was prompted by ‘gross injustice’ meted out to them by the national headquarters of the ANN, and that they were in any case never satisfied with the manifesto of the party. “Having carefully evaluated the manifesto of the party and the injustice by the national headquarters, we opted for the SDP which has a state chairman and governorship candidate that we have faith in,” Mathias said. Receiving the decampees on behalf of the National Chairman of the SDP Chief Olu Falae, the Adamawa State Chairman of the party, John Muva, assured that the new members and the old members would be treated in equal fairness. “The SDP is waxing stronger daily and we are set to win the state,” he stressed. The governorship candidate of the SDP in the state, Chief Emmanuel Bello, is a former House of Representatives member who has done much over the months to give visibility and reckoning to the party.
