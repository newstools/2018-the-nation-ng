Foreign portfolio investors appear to be discounting Nigeria’s political risks and focusing on the fundamentals of the markets. Trading data on foreign portfolio investments (FPIs) polled by the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) from major custodians and capital market operators showed a positive trajectory in both level of activities and the direction of transactions. The report, the latest on FPI, showed that inflows into the Nigerian investment market by foreign investors rose by about 85 per cent, on the same curve with an increase of 96.21 per cent on the total transactions by foreign portfolio investors. For the second consecutive month, Nigeria recorded positive net FPI position. The report for the trading month ended August 30, 2018 showed that total value of FPI transactions increased by 96.21 per cent from N36.17 billion in July 2018 to N70.97 billion in August 2018. Foreign portfolio inflow increased from N19.83 billion to N36.66 billion while foreign portfolio outflow increased from N16.34 billion to N34.31 billion, sustaining a two-month positive net FPI position. A year-to-date analysis showed improved performance in the FPI compared with the corresponding period of 2017. Total FPI transactions for the eight-month period ended August 2018 stood at N906.86 billion compared with N699.07 billion recorded in comparable period of 2017. Foreign inflow and outflow stood at N437.14 billion and N469.71 billion respectively in 2018 compared with N419.88 billion and N279.19 billion, narrowing the deficit considerably. The FPI report used two key indicators-inflow and outflow, to gauge foreign investors’ mood and participation in the stock market as a barometer for the economy. Foreign portfolio investment outflow includes sales transactions or liquidation of equity portfolio investments through the stock market while inflow includes purchase transactions on the NSE. The NSE report is generally regarded as a credible gauge of foreign portfolio investments in Nigeria as it coordinates data from nearly all active investment bankers and stockbrokers. Many analysts said the political risks, which had compounded macroeconomic risks as the 2019 elections approach, might be giving way to renewed optimism. Managing Director, NASD OTC Securities Exchange Plc, Mr Bola Ajomale, said Nigeria had pulled away from similar political skepticism and could repeat another round of peaceful elections. “A lot of people have been saying the elections are going to be difficult, things are going to slowdown and it will probably lead to a run on the market and so on. I’m beginning to take a bit of a contrarian view. Few years back, we had elections, very successful one that I think surprised people more than their expectations. I don’t think people expected that it would work out that smoothly. The same kind of pessimism is being expressed now that things are going to be difficult, it’s going to be a hard time, it’s going to be chaotic and so on and so forth. Who says that we cannot do it again? We have done it once before. I don’t anticipate nor do I expect there would be a particularly disruptive political process. And I think the more people start thinking in that manner, the better prepared to at least support the system running well,” Ajomale said. He noted that a smooth electoral process would enable Nigeria to achieve greater economic performance and strengthen investors’ confidence in the Nigerian economy. “In the best case scenario of a less disruptive and smooth election, I will expect that we will hit about three to four per cent growth rate next year; if we have a smooth transition in an election that is free and fair with no hassles whatsoever and we get the right ministers and the right calibre of people in the right places and we get work starting immediately,” Ajomale said. Analysts at Afrinvest Securities identified lingering political uncertainties and weakened appetite for emerging market assets as two major factors mitigating performance at the Nigerian stock market.
