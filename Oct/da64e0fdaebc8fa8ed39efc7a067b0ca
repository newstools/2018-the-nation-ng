The Aliko Dangote Foundation (ADF),the philanthropic endeavor of Aliko Dangote, has embarked $50 million to boost food fortification being one of the most cost-effective interventions for tackling micro nutrient deficiencies globally. Food fortification, in which essential micronutrients are added during food processing, has been widely identified as a cost-effective strategy for addressing micronutrient malnutrition at scale. Speaking in Lagos yesterday, Director Health & Nutrition, Dangote Foundation, Francis Aminu  said increasing the availability of fortified food in Nigeria should become a critical pillar of the country’s food and nutrition security plans. The Country Manager, HarvestPlus Nigeria, Paul Ilona said micronutrient malnutrition has far-reaching effects on individuals and impedes the economic development of the country. He said Nigeria loses over N450 billion in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually to vitamin and mineral deficiencies alone. He  said fortification of widely consumed foods is demonstrated to be a sustainable and effective way to improve nutrition in developing countries. Ilona said his organisation takes a holistic approach to addressing the technical challenges faced by processors and working to strengthen the enabling environment that promotes the competitive, healthy and effective production of fortified foods. According to him, HarvestPlus is hosting its 4th Nutritious Food Fair between November 7 and 9 at Landmark Event Centre, Victoria Island, Lagos  to facilitates opportunities and linkages for people especially youths to profitably invest in business of agriculture.
