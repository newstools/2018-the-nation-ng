The Deputy Vice Chancellor of University Of Lagos, Professor Folashade Ogunshola has advised people to be wary of the information they see on social media. She gave the advice at the 6th Ngozi Agbo Media Lecture and Summit held on Thursday October 11 2018. Ogunshola who was one of the special guests at the summit in her speech noted that while social media is a powerful tool used to share information, it can also be used  to mar and defame someone. ”There is a major responsibility on the media, so they don’t get caught on emotion, rather write stories based on evidence and fact’. ”Journalists should strive and get balanced news and evidence based information,” she said. Ogunshola further stated that If journalists don’t start working on investigative report, the social media will be used for oppression. “Since there is no regulation of the social media many bloggers tend to use it for disseminating fake news which most times many people tends to believe without even checking for facts.” She also advised journalists to extend their reach outside Nigeria and increase their global footprints.
