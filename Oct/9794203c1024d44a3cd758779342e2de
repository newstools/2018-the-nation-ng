A Karshi Grade 1 Area Court in Abuja on Friday sentenced one Harisu Salisu to three months imprisonment for criminal trespass and attempted theft. Salisu, 18, who resides in Nyanya in the FCT, pleaded guilty to charges of criminal trespass and attempted theft. He, however, pleaded with the court to temper justice with mercy in sentencing him. The Judge, Mr Aliyu Kagarko, who pronounced the guilty verdict after the convictâ€™s summary trial, however, gave Salisu an option to pay N7, 000 fine. He advised the convict to be of good behavior. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Mr Babatunde Adeyanju, told the court that one Damasabe Adamu of Kurudu village in Abuja, reported the matter at the Karu Police Station in Abuja on September 16. Adeyanju said the convict criminally trespassed into an aluminum company and attempted to steal aluminum materials kept in the premises before he was caught. He told the court that the offences contravened Sections 348 and 287 of the Penal Code.
