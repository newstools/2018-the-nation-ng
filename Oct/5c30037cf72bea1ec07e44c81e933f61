Ex-militants under the platform of the Coalition of Progressive Niger Delta ex-militants (CPNDE) yesterday rose from an emergency meeting in Lagos with a resolve to work for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari. The ex-militants said their decision to support Buhari’s second term bid was based on his efforts at deepening peace and stability in the Niger Delta by initiating meaningful projects and enhancement of human capital development through the Presidential Amnesty Programme. In a statement signed by its President Edeinowei Galabagalaba and Secretary, Gbobgo Eduobor, the group dismissed threats by a self-styled General Isreal Eshanekpe Akporodo to work against President Buhari’s re-election. It said Akporodo’s threat was an effort at seeking political patronage. “The so-called National Coalition of Niger Delta Ex-agitators which Akporodo claims to lead, is a phantom group merely on the pages of newspapers to promote his personal interest. He lacks the capacity to drive a process that would negatively affect the political fortunes of President Muhammadu Buhari in the Niger Delta region. We are resolute in our decision to ensure victory for Buhari in the Niger Delta in the 2019 presidential election. Towards this end, we have commenced consultative meetings to forge a common front. The Coalition of Progressive Niger Delta Ex-Militants, comprising several genuine camp leaders and their foot soldiers affirm our unwavering support for President Buhari”.
