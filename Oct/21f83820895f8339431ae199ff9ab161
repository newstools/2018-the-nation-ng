Youths in Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) have been warned to shun violence or face the music. The council Chairman, Alhaja Funmilayo Akande-Muhammed said this on Monday during Peace and Security Meeting held at the council secretariat. Those in attendance were security personnel, traditional rulers, party leaders, religious leaders, youth leaders and neighborhood Watch Corp members. Alhaja Akande-Muhammed explained that the security parley is crucial following some past ugly events in the area. She said there is need to forestall its re-occurrence and ensure security of lives and property. She told the stakeholders that all hands must be on deck to curb any form of nefarious activities. The council boss, however, sounded a note of warning to hoodlums that anyone caught will face the wrath of the law. According to her, no meaningful development can take place in any crisis-prone community. She appealed to the residents to allow peace to reign and shun fighting and killings. “We have been living peacefully in spite of our religions, ethnic and political diversity. That we must encourage and ensure we build upon. We will tolerate whoever either as a group or individuals no matter how highly placed that persons or group are to create chaos in our communities,” she said.
