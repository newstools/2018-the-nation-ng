Ahead of next month’s crucial AFCON 2019 qualifier against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa, Super Eagles’ first choice goalie, Francis Uzoho has revealed the team is now beaming with so much confidence and will be ready for the challenge of coach Stuart Baxter’s boys, AOIFootball.com reports. Uzoho, who is yet to taste a defeat in the qualifiers after keeping two clean sheets, further admitted that the team will take the South Africa game with all seriousness. “We will take the game against South Africa seriously because we have never underrated any team we have come up against. We know it won’t be an easy game but we are ready for them,” Uzoho said. The on-loan Doportivo La Coruna shot-stopper, who is yet to start a match for Elche in the league will be hoping his national team form will earn him another appearance for the club, having been in goal already in the Copa del Rey.
