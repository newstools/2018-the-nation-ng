The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus, says prospects of a better Nigeria are very bright, if democracy flourishes and people are allowed to exercise their franchise at will. Secondus said this in a statement issued by his Media Aide, Ike Abonyi, on Monday in Abuja, to mark Nigeria 58th Independence Anniversary. He said it was regrettable that a richly endowed nation like Nigeria was being declared the headquarters of the World poor due to leadership problem. Secondus expressed concern about threat to the country’s democracy as Nigeria celebrated another anniversary. According to him, this was witnessed at the last governorship election in Osun state, where he said that will of the people was truncated. He said that the consolation was that democracy provided Nigerians the opportunity to change bad government and urged them to do so in 2019. The PDP leader urged Nigerians to stand up against anything that would prevent them from freely determining who governs and how public funds were expended. Secondus wished Nigerians happy Independence Anniversary, saying they deserve salute for their dexterity in the face of  leadership problem. He also saluted Nigeria’s fallen heroes and wished Nigerians well, assuring them of a better Nigeria under a PDP administration. (NAN)
