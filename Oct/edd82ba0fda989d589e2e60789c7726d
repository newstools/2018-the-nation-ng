A factory worker, Sunday Shagidi, 24, was on Tuesday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court, for allegedly stealing cables worth N360,000 from a company. The accused, who resides at 34, Church Avenue, Ketu, Lagos, was docked on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The Prosecutor, Sergeant Kenrich Nomayo, told the court that the accused committed the offences with others still at large, on Oct. 12, at Eleganza Company located at 33, Billings Way, Oregun, Ikeja.
