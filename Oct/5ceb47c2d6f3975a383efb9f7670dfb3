A prominent Nollywood figure, Chris Ekejimbe is dead. Ekejimbe, a filmmaker and owner of 4Screams Production Company was a board member of the Association of Nollywood Core Producers (ANCOPS) and founder of notable Nollywood social media group, Film4Life. News of his demise was broken to members of the group by founding president of ANCOPS, Mr. Alex Eyengho early Saturday. “Folks! Sad day for Nollywood! Chris Ekejimbe just passed on a few moments ago at LUTH. Lord have mercy. I just spoke with the wife!” Eyengho stated. The news has sent shivers round Nollywood camps, with condolence messages pouring in, even from Kigali, Rwanda, where filmmakers and actors are gathered for the 14th edition of the Africa Movie Academy Awards (AMAA) holding tonight. Mr. Ekejimbe had been ill for a while and may have been last seen in public at the Nigerian creative industry summit at Protea Hotel, Ikeka, Lagos, last month.
