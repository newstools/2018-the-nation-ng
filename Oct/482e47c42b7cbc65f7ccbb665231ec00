The Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, a non government organisation, in conjunction with The Nigerian Union of Journalists, Lagos State Chapter, on Friday, trained journalists around Lagos on social protection. The training which was put in place to educate journalists in Lagos and expose them to exactly what social protection is and as well as let them know how they can play their roles was held at the Golden Tulip Hotel, Airport Road. At the training, Prof Ifeanyi Onyeonoru, who gave an overview of a publication on social protection in Nigeria, said that social protection is about policies and programmes that are designed to reduce poverty and vulnerability. He said that any policy on social protection should be able to raise the capacity of the ordinary man to manage economic and social risk including unemployment, social exclusion, sickness, disability and old age, he said people lacking all these becomes aggressive as nobody is attending to their interest. Other facilitators at the training were Lanre Arogundade who spoke onÂ ; Approaches to media promotion and reporting of social protection issues in Nigeria, among others.
