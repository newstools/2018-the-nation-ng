As part of measures to raise funds for its 2018 Harvest, the Catholic Church of The Ascension, Murtala Muhammed International, Airport, Ikeja, Lagos is set to organise a fund raising dinner. The event which is themed ‘Giving back to our society – lifting our youth’ will hold on Saturday, October 13, 2018 at the Legend Lagos Hotel, Quis Aviation Free Services Trade Zone, Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos. It will be hosted by frontline comedian Okey Bakassi. Recently, the comedian frowned against some clergymen who complained comedians cracked jokes about Christianity than other religions. And on Monday, Okey Bakassi who celebrated 25 years in the comic industry this year took to Instagram to wax philosophical about time. “Time is an important factor in everything you do….the most important currency,” he had posted. “You may have a lot of money but you don’t have a lot of time.”
