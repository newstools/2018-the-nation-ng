Super Eagles Striker, Henry Onyekuru has assured Nigerians that the team is ready to work hard for victory against Libya at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium, Uyo on Saturday. He said this in a tweet on Friday. According to him, the players are aware of what the coach wants, and they are ready to give in their all against the Medettarian Knights. “We know what the coach wants from us, which is to give our very best against Libya, that is exactly what we intend to do in both games. We will work hard to win and make our nation proud.” The coach, Gernot Rohr, had earlier noted that the Super Eagles are preparing for the match like they did against Cameroon last year. For him, “Two games in four days means we have to be very fit” The Super Eagles currently sit in third place in Group E with three points, with a win and a loss from the first two games.  They therefore need a victory on Saturday in Uyo, and on Tuesday, when they travel to Tunisia for the second leg, to be sure of a place in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations
