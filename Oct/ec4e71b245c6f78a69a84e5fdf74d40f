Suspected cult leader in Oworonshoki, Lagos, Kayode Ojo, has been arrested for alleged threat to kill a Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Ifeanyi Owo, a Chief Superintendent (CSP). Ojo, said to be the leader of the Vikings in the area, allegedly vowed to kill the DPO if he failed to release a member of his gang arrested during a fracas. It was learnt that the suspect made the threats through a hidden phone number on October 11, around 9am. He reportedly said he would also raze the police station. Owo was said to have alerted Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal of the threat, which prompted the command to declare a manhunt for the suspect. It was learnt that Ojo was tracked to a hideout at Obawole in Fagba after police decoded the number and located same at 15, Fakeye Street, off Jimoh Yusuf Street, Obawole, Fagba in Ikeja Local Government. According to Edgal, Ojo told the DPO that he would not know peace, would be killed and the police station burnt. Edgal said upon receipt of the threat, he directed the officer in charge of Anti-Kidnapping Squad to ensure the culprit was arrested. He said: “Consequently, the squad went underground and deciphered the unknown number to be 07033719352 owned by Austine Oghieh, 38. He was traced to 15, Fakeye Street, off Jimoh Yusuf Street, Obawole, Fagba in Ikeja Local Government where he was apprehended. The suspect confessed to the crime.  On completion of investigation, he will be arraigned.” The suspect admitted calling the DPO on the phone “over the arrest of a friend.” He, however, denied threatening to kill Owo and denied that he was a cultist. Asked what the marks on his face represented, Ojo said they were tribal marks and not cult symbols.
