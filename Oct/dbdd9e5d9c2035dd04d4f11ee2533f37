Ekiti State House of Assembly has screened and confirmed two commissioners-designate nominated by Governor Kayode Fayemi. The two candidates, Mr. Olawale Fapohunda and Mr. Oladapo Kolawole, appeared before the lawmakers at about 2.30 pm on Thursday where they were asked questions. Fapohunda, a lawyer, served as Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice while Kolawole, a chartered accountant and tax expert, served as Commissioner for Finance and Economic Development during Fayemi’s first tenure. The House at its plenary also approved the request of the governor seeking approval for the appointment of ten Special Advisers. Speaker Adeniran Alagbada who read a letter from the governor to his colleagues at plenary, urged them to adequately look into the request for smooth runnings of government. After being grilled by the legislators, Fapohunda and Kolawole were found qualified and fit for positions of commissioners. The duo are expected to return to their former offices and would be sworn in by the governor any moment from now. The lawmakers unanimously observed that both men had served the state in the past and performed creditably well. Deputy Speaker Olusegun Adewumi charged the two commissioner nominees to “think outside the box by attracting businesses into the state to improve the economy instead of overtaxing the people.” Alagbada also commended Governor Fayemi for choosing people of integrity as commissioners and praised his colleagues for their prompt action.
