The National Association of Microfinance Banks (NAMB) has expressed dissatisfaction with the publication of the names of microfinance banks, whose licences were revoked by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The President, Mr. Roggers Nwoke, spoke yesterday in Lagos an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said such publication could lead to a run on banks, adding that besides, the association and apex body had reached a consensus to control the publicity. Nwoke said some of the banks that got their names published were still active. NAN reports that the apex bank, on September 26, gave a notification to revoke operating licences of 182 other financial institutions. According to the list released by the regulator, 154 of the affected institutions are microfinance banks, six are primary mortgage banks, while the remaining 22 are finance companies. According to CBN, 62 of the microfinance banks have already closed shop, 74 became insolvent, 16 were terminally distressed, while six were voluntarily liquidated. The NAMB boss said the association was not happy with the development, adding that some microfinance banks that had closed shop for two years could not claim to be in operation. “However, the paramount issue here is that most banks the CBN claimed to be insolvent have injected capital and back to business fully,” he said. Nwoke said the association would embark on dialogue with the apex body to effect necessary corrections.
