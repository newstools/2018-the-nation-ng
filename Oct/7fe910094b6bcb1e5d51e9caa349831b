The Co-Founder & Project Lead of Galaxy4Peace Precious Ajunwa has called on the Federal Government and other stakeholders to invest more in peace education to reduce violent conflicts among youths in Nigeria. She spoke at the 5th edition of the annual Sweat4Peace in commemoration of the International Day of Peace in Lagos. Over 500 participants from Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt and Ibadan witnessed the event. Ajunwa said: “At a time hate crimes are on the increase, we must more than ever continuously invest and teach children the values of love, peace, forgiveness, empathy, tolerance and non-violence not only on this global day but at all times. “We want to have them commit to peace despite their inherent differences, while highlighting their roles in achieving SDGs No. 16 – Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions.” Sweat4Peace Team Lead Abuja, Adebote Oluwaseyifunmi, challenged youths to become ambassador of peace within their communities.
