Abia State government is partnering Aba Chamber of Commerce, Industries, Mines and Agriculture (ACCIMA) and Abia Think Tank group in a three-day investment summit in Aba aimed at repositioning the city as prime investment hub in the country. Addressing newsmen in Aba, the adviser on Job Creation to Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, Chief Chineye Nwogu said the state was partnering ACCIMA on the investment summit because the body has been projecting Aba’s economic potentials to the outside world. Nwogu said it was due to Ikpeazu’s desire to see that made-in-Aba goods were patronised all over the world that inspired his approval and support of the summit. ACCIMA president, Chief Andy Obasi said the summit would not only provide solutions to the economic problems of the city, but would also stimulate the investment potentials of Aba. Obasi informed that the Chamber has registered Aba Business School (ABS) which he said is basically meant for artisans in the city and beyond to further their education to hone their skills and improve on their trade. He said the major problems the business community in Aba is lack of information and power, a twin problem he said they are tackling. “Our major problem is power and we are discussing with Geometrics Power Ltd. and we thank God that Governor Ikpeazu is weighing in to solve the problem between Enugu Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) and Geometrics Power. “Another problem we have is that of lack of information by the artisans concerning how business are carried on in other parts of the world which we have tackled and asked artisans to come and access them”. The summit runs from October 25 to 27 in Aba.
