… Seek his blessings, support for Atiku  Former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on Thursday visited former President Olusegun Obasanjo in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, to seek his blessings ahead of the 2019 presidential election in Nigeria. Atiku who arrived Obasanjo’s residence within the sprawling Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library (OOPL) by 1.09pm with entourage comprising the PDP National Chairman, Uche Secondus, former Governor of Cross River State, Liyel Imoke, Director – General, Atiku Campaign Organisation(ACO), Otunba Gbenga Daniel, Spokesperson of ACO, Segun Sowunmi among others, went into a closed door meeting with his erstwhile boss. Atiku’s visit is coming about 48 hours after an elder statesman, Chief Ayo Adebanjo, led a delegation the Afenifere leaders to the Ebora Owu, where the spokesman of the Socio – cultural organisation, Yinka Odunmakin hinted that the Yoruba race in Nigeria would support a presidential candidate with an agenda to restructure the nation’ flawed federation. So far, former Vice – President Atiku had continued to promise Nigerians that he would restructure the country within his first year in office if given the mandate to preside over the affairs of Nigeria. Today’s meeting may redefine Obasanjo’s position on Atiku and perhaps, tilt towards supporting him in the 2019 presidential race against the incumbent, President Muhammadu Buhari.
