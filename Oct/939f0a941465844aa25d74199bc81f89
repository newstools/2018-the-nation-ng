She said ‘’In this part of the country, the girl child is often compelled to early marriage and hawking with little attention on her education. Her parents are least perturbed whether she went to school or not, hence we place our focal attention on Girl Child Education’’ On the controversy surrounding the out-of –school syndrome, she dismissed the claim that a huge population of the children mostly in the North were out of school; arguing that Quranic schooling represents a form of education which only needed to be registered and regulated like other schools. She said “Go to Bangladesh, Quranic schools are registered and regulated by Government as a type of education. All these Children you see on the streets attends one form of school or the other both the conventional type and the Quranic schools. So why do you say they are out of school’
