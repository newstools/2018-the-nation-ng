COFFEE as widely known is a brewed drink processed from roasted coffee beans. It is gotten from a genus of plants known as coffea. Research shows that coffee is grown in more than 70 countries around the world having its origin in Ethiopia  and Sudan. It comes in different colours such as black,  dark brown and light brown. Coffee is one of the world most popular drinks best taken in the morning or evening. Good as coffee may taste, it has health implications, especially on male fertility.  A good number of men take coffee two to three times per week if not everyday. Men consuming  caffeine in moderation shouldn’t be too concerned that their  habit will hinder their fertility,  because men who drink less coffee has high chances of becoming a father. The secret is knowing the quantity that makes it moderate. A laboratory scientist, Dr. Nnaji Kelvin of Pharms Biomedics Center, Imo State has said that the excess of coffee intake reacts on male sperm but moderate intake of it stimulates the sperm to work faster. Dr. Oshodi Sunday of Saint Milas Hospital, Lagos, said it has not been proven whether coffee affects a man’s fertility or not but it can be taken to keep the body awake and relaxes the muscles and cells. Caffeine consumption in the male partner may reduce IVF outcome. According to a research, men who drank more than four cups of coffee a day had a higher proportion of abnormally shaped sperm, but as long as the number of cups are below three it doesn’t  affect the sperm. Therefore researchers advise sticking to low calorie tea and coffee intake. According to Dr. Anatte Kermon, an obstetrician, Massachusetts General Hospital,  high  male caffeine consumption appears to reduce couples’ chances of achieving  clinical pregnancy, though moderate intake of coffee is beneficial to the health.
