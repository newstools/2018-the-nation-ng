The convention, which started at 8:50 p.m. on Saturday, when the National Chairman of PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, declared it open, had the Chairman of the Elective National Convention Planning Committee of the party, Senator Ifeanyi Okowa, who is the Governor of Delta State, assuring that the event would be free, fair, transparent and credible, while he eventually announced the results from 12:44 p.m. Voting by the accredited delegates from the 36 states of Nigeria and Abuja ended at 6:15 a.m. today (Sunday), with Akwa Ibom State having the highest number of delegates of 151, while Ogun State had the lowest delegates of 21, in view of the unending litigation and factions. While announcing the results of the election, Okowa thanked God on the success of the convention and he congratulated Atiku on his electoral victory, wishing him well in next yearâ€™s presidential race. In his acceptance speech, Atiku described the primary election as the most credible, transparent, free and fair, in the history of PDP, while lauding former President Olusegun Obasanjo for giving him the opportunity in 1999 to be his deputy, while admitting that he learnt a lot under his tutelage. Atiku also lauded Wike, Rivers government and the people of Rivers state on their support for the successful convention, while assuring that he would not fail and would not be found wanting. While speaking on behalf of the eleven aspirants, Saraki promised that all of them and their teeming supporters would work with the newly-elected presidential candidate of PDP, with the convention ending at 1:28 p.m.
