A new historical movie, The Chronicles, from the stables of Frank Records is set to hit cinemas nationwide on November 9, 2018. Force with taunts of coming from Mbaise, Imo State, two teenagers seek to understand why their ancestry is made fun of. At their insistence, their parents take them to their grandmother (Onyeka Onwenu) who spends the night telling them the story. The movie which was produced by Frank Ufomadu and directed by Caliph Ibn.Uzar stars Onyeka Onwenu, Segun Arinze, Victor Osuagwu, Daniel Llyod, Giovanni Grossman (Italian) Avinanash Bhavanni (British/Indian) Agbogidi Clemson, Felix Omorkhodion, Okey Jude and Zikky Alloy. Written by Ufomadu, ‘The Chronicles’ sought to reveal how the the saying ‘Spare the snake and kill the man’ came about during the pre and post colonial era in the eastern part of the country, and how a particular musical band falsified the belief to include the Mbaise man. “I was in secondary school when I heard about the stigma of that afage about Mbaise people,” Ufomadu said. “I asked from my people but I couldn’t get an answer. ” Actually, that adage came from a band, Oriental Brothers but many people didn’t know what transpired between the Oriental Brothers that led to that adage. It was out of ignorance of one of the Oriental Brothers who never knew what is joint account.”
