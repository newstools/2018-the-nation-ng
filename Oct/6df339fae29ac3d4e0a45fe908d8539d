A member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) aspiring to represent Lagos East Senatorial District, Ajao Onalapo Afeez Adetola, has explained why he stepped down for Senator Gbenga Ashafa. He said he took the decision to enable Ashafa continue his good programmes. Ashafa is vying for a third term. Adetola, who spoke with reporters at the weekend, said: “Having witnessed the great work Senator Ashafa has done and inspected over 96 projects undertaken by him, it has become glaring that Senator Ashafa should be supported because he has the interest of the people of Lagos East at heart. He knows the right thing to do. “Therefore, I have declared my readiness to support him in his bid to return to the hallowed chambers of the Senate, not just to continue his good work, but also to ensure improved representation for Lagos East and Nigeria,” He added: “I enjoin well-wishers, supporters and loyalists to join me in endorsing Ashafa’s mandate, which has grown to become our mandate, so that he will emerge victorious at the primaries tomorrow. I thank you all for your time and efforts.” Ashafa’s aide, Temitope Atiba, hailed Adetola for his decision, saying it was commendable. He said Ashafa would step up his good work,  especially youth development and empowerment.
