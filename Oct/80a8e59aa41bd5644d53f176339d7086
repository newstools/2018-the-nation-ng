The Lagos State House of Assembly has denied the rumour in the media that it is planning to impeach Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Speaking at plenary yesterday, Speaker Mudashiru Obasa urged the public to disregard the rumour. Obasa said he had received telephone calls and enquiries from prominent residents on the alleged impeachment plan against Ambode. According to him, Solidarity Group of Nigeria and a faction of the state chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), led by Mr. Fuad Oki, had been insinuating that the state’s lawmakers allegedly threatened the governor to open the treasury for them or face impeachment. Obasa said: “We are not embarking on any impeachment process against the governor. If there would be an impeachment, it would be from the governor. And if there would not be any need for impeachment, it would be from him, based on his actions. “Even at that, impeachment is constitutional. So many speakers, Senate presidents, presidents and others have been impeached all over the world. So, nobody can threaten us if it happens because we are representatives of the people. “We don’t need the wailers to guide us in performing our duties. It is not out of place for us to do our job.” The Speaker added that if there was going to be an impeachment, it would be done in the open. He said Lagos residents would know if an impeachment against the governor would happen. Obasa said the Assembly was working with Ambode to ensure peace and development across the state. Majority Leader Sanai Agunbiade said the constitutional procedure for an impeachment does not harbour secrecy, adding that the public would know if it would happen. Last week, the Assembly ordered the 20 local government areas and 37 local council development areas (LCDAs) in the state to direct the operators of private sector participation (PSP) involved in refuse collection to return to work.
