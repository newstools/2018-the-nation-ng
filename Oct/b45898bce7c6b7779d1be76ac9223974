Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) General Manager (GM)Mr Funmi Osifuye has faulted town planners for removing some villages from the urban development plan. He spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Lagos. Osifuye spoke on the backdrop of a draft report on geo-referenced infrastructural mapping of Kosofe and Mainland local councils and development plans for Lakowe and Itoikin excised villages. The report has since been submitted by the District and Local Plans Department (DLPD) to LASPPPA. According to him, town planners must assist by extending urban and infrastructure development programmes to the villages to ensure a comprehensive development of the state. He noted that although planning a city was tough, all stakeholders must be involved to achieve result. “The planning of towns, districts, local governments and others must be done by all professionals and not left to officers in the DLPD alone. “All stakeholders must be engaged in the development of plans and the implementation of priority projects,” Osifuye said. According to him, proper planning brings good urbanisation, economic growth, job opportunities and reduces rural-urban migration. DLPD Director Mr. Abubakre Ogunneye said the draft report was necessary to show the location and the spread of infrastructure in the districts. He said the report also showed other details such as urban design, pedestrian bridges, parks, canal setbacks, road improvement and sewage control, among others.
