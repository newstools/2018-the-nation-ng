Lagos State government has said it will ensure intending pilgrims to the holy land of Israel, Greece and Rome meet administrative criteria and are medically-fit. It said this was stipulated by the national body coordinating holy pilgrimage across the country. The Secretary of Lagos State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board, Mrs. Yetunde Gbafe, who spoke at the medical/ administrative screening for the 2018 intending pilgrims to the Holy Land of Israel, at the Chapel of Christ the Light, Alausa, Ikeja, said the purpose of the screening is to ensure that those that will embark on the journey do not have any life-threatening ailment or have obtained their travelling documents through illegal means. She said: “We need to screen the intending pilgrims medically to ensure they are physically fit to embark on this journey, because the nature of the journey consumes a lot of energy, hence the need for them to be medically fit after which they will be administratively screened. The screening will also provide an avenue for us to check their international passports if they have not expired and to know if they have information about themselves.” Gbafe said the medical screening was a pre-requisite for the administrative screening. She advised the intending pilgrims to display positive attitude that would reflect the godly status of the state and country. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Religious Matter, Dr. Kolawole Verrals, said the screening would assist in doing a profile check of the intending pilgrims, adding that it would establish the authenticity of the information they have filled in their forms. He said the exercise is very important because it enables the government to ascertain clarity on intending pilgrims’ spiritual intentions to the holy land of Israel.
