Lagos State government said yesterday that efforts were on to rehabilitate failed portions of highways and roads across the metropolis. It pledged to fix potholes in the coming days. Works and Infrastructure Commissioner Mr. Ade Akinsanya, in a statement, said although many roads had been fixed in the last few weeks, the government would scale up efforts to ensure that dilapidated sections of roads were rehabilitated, to bring comfort to residents and motorists.

Ojota, Ketu and Mile 12 sections of the Ikorodu road have been attended to, while work is ongoing on Ijede-Ewu-Elepe road in Ikorodu, among others. “The various failed portions on the Lagos Badagry expressway are also being attended to at present.
