VICE President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday met with Adamawa State Governor Jibrilla Bindow at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. After over one hour closed doors meeting, Bindow dodged reporters, who were waiting to interview him on the state’s primary elections. He was sneaked out from the Vice President’s office through the backdoor when the meeting ended around 5p.m The President’s wife, Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, whose brother lost Adamawa All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket to Bindow, had on Sunday blamed the party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole, over what she described as impunity and unfairness in the conduct of the primary elections. She had claimed that the party appeared to have granted automatic tickets to some political office aspirants while denying others the opportunity to contest after paying huge amounts of money to purchase nomination forms. Mrs. Buhari regretted that despite coming from Labour background, Oshiomhole left the side of the people and presided over the impunity.
