Sefiya Ibrahim, the IAAF silver label Okpekpe road race theme song composer is out with a blockbuster hit single titled, Your Money. The budding, Abia state-born afro-pop songstress and Computer Science graduate from the University of Lagos, teamed up with the King of new school dancehall, Sugarbana in the exhilarating song produced by Richie. In the much-anticipated song, Sefiya, a certified graduate of the prestigious Nigerian Muson School of Music, where she majored in music dynamics and vocal training, sings about an unidentified lover whom she adores wholeheartedly but only due to his heavy pockets and the luxurious items he possesses. She sings “I’m in love with your body, No be my fault, Na your money.” Her collaborator Sugarbana brings his usual highly-spirited delivery to the song, singing every bar in Patois which effortlessly compliments Safiya’s vocals and the instrumental considerably. Directed by The Alien and WG Films of Capital Dreams, the video to ‘Your Money’; also released along with the audio, vividly captures the chemistry between Sefiya and Sugarbana, which is quite commendable; making ‘Your Money’ a definite TV and radio smash hit. ‘Your Money’ marks Safiya’s second musical effort of the year, following the release of her EP ‘Antidote’, which was released earlier in January. She followed that up with the Okpekpe road race theme song in May which received commendations from many sports and music lovers including Godwin Obaseki, the executive Governor of Edo state during the pre-race dinner in Auchi. Sefiya has promised music lovers and her fans more exciting materials before the year runs out.
