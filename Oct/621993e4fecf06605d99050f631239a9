The two suspects arrested for attempting to kill a Lagos lawyer, Prof. McCarthy Mbadugha, have told the police that they attacked him for not paying their salary when due. This was contained in a statement by police spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), in reaction to reports on Mbadughaâ€™s attack. According to Oti, the suspects identified as Kingsley Asuquo, 19 and Isaac Edet, 18, both guards attached to the lawyer from Strongcity Security Services Ltd, said they planned to kill him if it became necessary. It was gathered that the suspects were angry that they were not being paid when due despite the money being made by the lawyer from his clients. Denying that the victim was attacked by unknown assailants, Oti said both suspects were guards attached to him, adding that efforts were being made to apprehend their accomplices.
