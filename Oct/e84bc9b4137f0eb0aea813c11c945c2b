A Senior Fellow on Information Systems at the Lagos Business School and Digital Financial Services Specialist, Dr. Yinka David-West, has advised Nigerians to be open to new technology that is rapidly growing in the world. Technology, according to her, can reduce unemployment in not-too distant future. Speaking at the Empowerment Summit 2018 of the Professional Accountants’ Christian Ministry (PACM) at its headquarters in Yaba, Lagos, she said, “Accountants should be proactive, learning new technology in order to meet up with the fast growing technology in the world. And while doing research, you should be more concerned about Cyber security, which is very important.” Speaking on ‘Technological disruption and the future of Accounting Profession’, she said the one-day programme was to afford the attendees the opportunity to learn, review, correct, remediate and put controls in place. In his presentation, a Partner and West Africa Tax Leader (PwC), Mr. Taiwo Oyedele, gave insights into understanding the effect of the recently introduced transfer pricing regime and the impact on businesses. He explained that only extremely decent Nigerians pay their taxes and challenged politicians to pay taxes and show proof of payment so as to be great examples to their followers. In his closing remarks, the president, Professional Accountants’ Christian Ministry, (PACM), Pastor Shola Adegbenro thanked the speakers for making the summit a success.
