He alleged that the accused ran away with a car belonging to Mr. Chikwukadibia Udeh. “The complainant approached the accused for prayers. The accused claimed God told him that he should bring his car and the document for prayers. “The complainant obeyed and after the accused collected the car and its document, he was no where to be found. “Efforts made by the complainant to recover his car proved unsuccessful and the case was reported to the police,” the prosecutor said.
