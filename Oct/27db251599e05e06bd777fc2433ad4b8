Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has picked a former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi as his running mate. The only official confirmation of the choice of Obi came from Mr. Ike Abonyi, the Media Adviser to the national chairman of the PDP, Prince Uche Secondus. Abonyi confirmed the report through a terse text message, stating “confirmed” without further comments. A competent source in the Atiku camp had earlier confirmed the development to our correspondent on the telephone on Friday. The source however pleaded not to be quoted because he did not have the mandate to speak on the matter. “Yes, it is true that Mr. Peter Obi has been chosen to be Atiku’s running mate”, the source said emphatically without further comments. The choice of Obi was said to be premised on the strong presence of the PDP in the South East zone where Obi hailed from. Obi was elected governor of Anambra State from 2006 to 2014 on the platform of the All Progressive Gand Alliance (APGA). He defected to the PDP in 2015, following a disagreement with his successor and protege, Mr. Willie Obiano who was also elected on the platform of APGA. Attempts by Obi to frustrate Obiano’s reelection in 2017 failed as Obiano defeated Obi’s preferred candidate, Dr. Henry Obaze Oseloka of the PDP. The choice of Obi was said to have been premised on the strong presence of the PDP in the South East zone. Three of the five states in the zone, Abia, Enugu and Ebonyi are under the control of the PDP. Imo and Anambra are under the control of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the APGA respectively. Incidentally, Anambra State where Obi hailed from is being controlled by APGA.
