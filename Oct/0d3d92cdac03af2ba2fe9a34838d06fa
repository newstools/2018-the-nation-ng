“It is no more secret that Dr. Okowa has been the Governor whose administration has touched the lives of the people of the state. No doubt, both Deltans and non-Deltans have appraised the present administration in the state and lauded the solid achievements of the Governor”, said Abideke. “The primary election has been conducted and Governor Okowa emerged as the sole gubernatorial candidate of the PDP in the state. It is also a clear indication of his giant developmental stride; hence majority of Deltans are clamouring for his return in 2019”, stressed the PDP chieftain. The Ijaw leader however assured that his people are ready to vote Okowa again in 2019, because he has truly showed that he is committed to  the wellbeing of the people.
