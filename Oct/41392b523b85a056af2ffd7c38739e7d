The  All Progressives Congress (APC)in Ondo State has said that the report on the proposed defection by aspirants is false. The party in a statement by its spokesman, Alex Kalejaye, said the reaction was imperative to erase the erroneous impression, and assure party faithful that the chapter is intact. He said APC will resolve to handle whatever grievances that might have arisen from the primaries. Among prominent names that have been pencilled down for defection are Lucky Ayedatiwa and Dr. Tunji Abayomi, a senatorial hopeful from Ondo North. Ayedatiwa is the Ondo State representative on the governing board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, and senatorial aspirant from Ondo South. The statement said: ”There is no iota of truth in such permutation, and imaginative analysis. Hon. Ayedatiwa, for example, has said repeatedly that he would never leave the APC for any other party. “Like Ayedatiwa, most aspirants, from the senatorial, the House of Representatives, to the State House of Assembly, have put the primaries behind them and are currently preoccupied with how the party would triumph during the general elections.” The party, however, said it is not under any illusions that there is need to reach some members that might have picked offence at the party decisions, with a view to pacifying them, to enhance the party’s chances in 2019.
