The council of chiefs and residents of Ijede have appealed to the Lagos State government to repair the roads in the community. They spoke yesterday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) at Ijede palace. The Regent, Chief Aliu Musediku, said the deplorable state of the roads had affected economic activities. He said the condition of the roads had caused increase in accidents. “We want the government to help us repair the roads. If you want to go to the metropolis, you will spend at least three hours due to the deplorable conditions of the roads. “Sometimes, while drivers are trying to avoid potholes, accidents occur. “We have written to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. He promised to repair the roads, but nothing has been done to alleviate our suffering,” the regent said. He said the deplorable state of roads had discouraged residents from doing business, adding that some had relocated from the community. A resident, Mr. Taiwo Oredoyin, urged the government to prioritise roads linking one community to the other. Mr. Wasiu Ogundeyin, a commercial driver, said vehicles had been damaged, forcing people to spend a lot on repairs. He added that the bad roads were the causes of gridlock in the area. “Governor Ambode has performed, but we urge him to do more because that is the only way the people can enjoy the dividends of democracy,” Ogundeyin said.
