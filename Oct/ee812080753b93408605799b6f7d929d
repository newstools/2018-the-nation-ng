Women in Ondo state on Wednesday demanded for equal gender representation in democracy, stressing that they are marginalised in politics. Addressing reporters in Akure, the Ondo state capital, the Coordinators, Women For Women, Restoration of the Dignity of Womanhood and Women Alert groups, Mrs Olamide Falana, Mrs Olabisi Omolona and Mrs Kehinde Adewole-Alli respectively vowed not to mobilize women to cast their votes for any political party if something was not done before the general elections. The pressure groups maintained that women have what it takes to rule, stressing that they should be allowed to contest favourably in any post in the forthcoming election. Falana, Omolona and Adewole-Alli therefore demanded 35 percent female representation in all socio-political and economic sectors. They said”Political party should give us the opportunity to participate in the general elections, we are now cries out of our 35 percent right across the political board for us to be liberated. We have been marginalized across the political party. “Ondo state government should also consider us in appointment, we are also good in various offices not only in the kitchen or bedroom, we are not happy with the situation, government must do something now. “Ondo women are united in order to move the state forward, we want political empowerment for our young ones and widows”. The groups however explained that women in the state were prepared to participate fully in all political activities if given the opportunity.
