The All Progressives Congress (APC) has intervened in the crisis that rocked the Edo State House of Assembly on Monday, which led to the impeachment of Deputy Speaker Victor Edoror. Two lawmakers, Foly Ogedengbe (Owan East) and Gani Audu (Estako West 1), were suspended for three months. A former Speaker, Justin Okonoboh, was named the new deputy Speaker. The warring lawmakers met with the State Working Committee at the party secretariat. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, State Chairman Anselm Ojezua said progress had been made to reconcile the lawmakers. Ojezua dismissed insinuations that the crisis was as a result of unhealthy relationship between Adams Oshiomhole and Governor Godwin Obaseki. He said issues at the Assembly were personal and a case of mutual suspicion. “It is typical for anybody to say he is an Oshiomhole boy. We are all Oshiomhole boys including all the APC lawmakers. “So what happened is not as a result of any imaginary crisis but mutual suspicion and personal matters.”
