Akwa Ibom State Governor Udom Emmanuel  yesterday said he would not be distracted by the antics of political opponents. According to him, the opponents were allegedly planning to cause mayhem and disrupt the elections. Speaking with State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, he said that only God ultimately gives power and that he was not afraid of losing re-election next year. He said: “There is something you people must know. When it comes to power it is only God who determines and we are conscious of that. We are professionals who have made names in other places. So, when people just discuss some of these things we keep doing our own businesses. “At times, some of these things are to distract you but we refuse to be distracted. We play politics of development and our people are seeing that. So, whatever would have tried in any way to distract us we don’t want to be distracted. So, don’t be bothered about that. It is only God who determines what happens the next minute, not man. And no man is God.” He also said anyone planning violence and war in Akwa Ibom was wasting his time as the people have resolved to be peaceful,  pointing out that such threats were being noted at the Presidency. “At the moment , Akwa Ibom State is very peaceful. We only hear of those plots. I am sure you people heard where people were pronouncing that Warsaw, Warsaw, and that’s what they wish Akwa Ibom would be. “But we indigenes are saying no, we are peaceful and we want to maintain peace. Whoever wants to live by Warsaw, will also see war on his own, not within the state.”
