Gernot Rohr has said the Super Eagles will be seeking to avenge a 0-2 home loss against South Africa when both teams battle again next month for places at the 2019 AFCON. Bafana Bafana recorded their first-ever official win over Nigeria in June 2017 when they won 2-0 in Uyo. The two teams clash again on November 17 in Johannesburg with Nigeria needing just a point to qualify for Cameroun 2019. Rohr says the home loss to South Africa still rankles and he hopes his team could now get their pound of flesh. “The defeat still hurts and we want to take revenge for it,” the coach told Kick Off Magazine. “They beat us with strong counter attacks in Uyo. We dominated the game and actually played quite well in the first half, but didn’t score. And then they attacked us on the counter, one towards the end when we pressed for the equaliser.” He continued: “It was in June 2017, which is now quite a long time ago. I remember we had many players absent at the time, with that match taking place in the break between the seasons. I’m happy that everyone will be available this time around and that our team can get revenge for that defeat.” Rohr picked striker Percy Tau as his best South Africa player.
