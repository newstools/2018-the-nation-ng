A third year Law student of the Joseph Ayo Babalola University, Osun State, Arinze Okoye, has emerged the 2018 Mr Nigeria International Heritage. The 20-year-old, who stands at over six foot two inches” was crowned at this year’s Mr and Miss Nigeria International pageant held at Ruby’s Garden in Lekki, Lagos, recently. With his new crown, he is expected to promote Nigeria’s cultural heritage within and outside the country. The annual Mr. and Miss Nigeria International pageant is organized by Brendance and Crusaders Limited to create opportunities for both women and men around the world through its network of relationships across entertainment, fashion and philanthropy. The pageant encourages the youth to believe in themselves and challenges them to discover their potentials and work towards achieving them.  The pageant also aims at educating the youths especially on poise and class. Okoye represented Ebonyi State in the keenly contested pageant. The law student said he would love to use his office to work on promoting Nigeria’s rich culture locally and internationally. “This is the 21st century, but that doesn’t mean we should neglect our customs and traditions which are our identity. Our culture reminds us of who we are and where we come from. During my reign, I will focus on the young ones out there, educating them about our indigenous ways and lifestyle. “Before my tenure comes to an end, I want to affect the society in every positive way I can, I want to start up youth empowerment programmes, I want to help the less privileged and hospital patients who have been neglected or abandoned all because they lack the resources to pay their bills, I want to go out there and change lives,” he stated.
