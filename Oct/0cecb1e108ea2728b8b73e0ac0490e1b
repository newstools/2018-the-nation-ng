Ahead of the November release date of his new single produced by BlaqJerzee, Nigerian singer/songwriter Kay Jay Ogbonna has signed a management deal with The Boost Entertainment. According to the multi-million naira deal, the company will handle all the bookings and management affairs of the artiste who was nominated for the Nigerian Entertainment Awards 2018 ‘Fresh Vibes of The Year’ category. Born Victor Ogbonna, Kay Jay, who hails from Abia State, started music professionally in 2012 as a songwriter, composing songs for A-list artists like TundeEdnut (‘Catching Cold’), Iyanya (‘IyanuMashele’), KCEE (‘Burn’&‘Psycho’), Naeto C, Kach (‘Olo’), Chuddy K (‘Go Down’), Stunna (‘Balance’ featuring Iyanya), Samklef, Tillaman, BimbiPhiliphs (Duro Dada). His hit songs include ‘Sell Over’ featuring Skales & Omo Akin (Produced by Kenny Wonder) and ‘Work & Pray’ featuring Shaydee (Produced by BlaqJerzee). Kay Jay said he signed with The Boost Entertainment because he shared the ‘same vision’ with the company and says he sees himself as a ‘big brand’ in ‘five years’ time. “I see them making me one of the biggest artists in Nigeria and beyond,” he said. “Despite being newly established, this is one of the first and few music management companies in Nigeria that fund the artist, and I feel that is how it should be – it gave me even more assurance to work with them. They are not just bringing funds, strategy and ideas; they are bringing full hands on involvement and direction, with a unique attention to visual content creation.” According to the Managing Director of The Boost Entertainment, Miss Kiki Agbakoba, the company was formed to support artistes’ growth. “Fate had its way when we crossed paths with Kay Jay while in search for music talents,” she said. “With this official signing of Kay Jay, our first artist, we plan to activate and create a new SI unit for music content management and creative business positioning.”
