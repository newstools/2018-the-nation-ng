Following a continuous fall in the rupee’s value against the United States’ dollar, Panasonic India NSE  last week said it is mulling raising prices of mobile phones and consumer appliances in the range of five to seven per cent post festive season. “Post Diwali, if the situation of exchange rate continues where it is or beyond 72 (against USD) then there will be a price increase to the extent of 5-7 per cent which will happen in the market. That’s inevitable,” Panasonic India and South Asia President and CEO Manish Sharma told PTI. The rupee hit a record low of 74.50 against the dollar in early deals. Sharma, who is also the president of Consumer Electronics and Appliances Manufacturers Association (CEAMA), said there is significant impact of rupee depreciation. “Fundamentally, our objective, especially when we look at first week of November, (is) to ensure that festive season goes with vibrancy… so (currently), we are not making any price (hike), not only in mobile phones but also in consumer appliances,” Sharma said. said. He, however, clarified that he is not sure about other companies but “for Panasonic it seems inevitable”.
