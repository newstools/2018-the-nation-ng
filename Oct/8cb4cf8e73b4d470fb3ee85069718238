About N795 million has been released for the payment of accrued pension of retirees in Lagos State. The Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC) said yesterday that the gesture was in fulfilment of monthly pension settlement embarked on by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. LASPEC said the fund was released for 213 public service retirees under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS). It said 9,804 retirees had been paid their accrued pension arrears of N40,245 billion. The cash, it said, was  paid into the beneficiaries’ Retirement Savings Accounts (RSA) from the inception of the Governor Ambode administration to date. “His Excellency has remained committed to pensioners’ welfare despite the huge funding obligations facing the administration. “For this reason, funds are released monthly into the RSA of employees. The accrued rights are gradually being cleared,” LASPEC said in a statement by its Director-General, Mrs. Folashade Onanuga. The commission said there was a move by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) to execute the Pension Law on guaranteed Minimum Pension for life. “The law will be executed for retirees under the Programmed Withdrawal benefit option, as it will be recalled that the annuity option offers pension for life for the annuitants,” the statement said.
