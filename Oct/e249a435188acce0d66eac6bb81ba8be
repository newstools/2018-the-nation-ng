Ajax Amsterdam coach Erik Ten Hag left Germany with mixed feelings after Tuesday’s unexpected 1-1 draw for his youthful team at Bayern Munich in the Champions League. Ajax fell behind early to a Mats Hummels header but then equalised through Moroccan fullback Noussair Mazraoui to move to four points from their two Group E games and with real hopes of advancing to the knockout phase. Ten Hag, however, was disappointed at his side not being able to become the first Dutch side to win at Bayern after they had the better of the chances. “On the one hand, I’m really satisfied but on the other, this was a game we could and should have won,” Ten Hag, a former reserve team coach at Bayern, told reporters after the stalemate against the misfiring German champions. “We laid down a really good achievement, right from the start of the game. “We have a good team but we need to mature a bit more, but we were full of enthusiasm and willingness.” Bayern struggled to build on their advantage and their recent slump continued as they battled to keep a vibrant Ajax at bay. “Bayern really struggled with the fact that we were constantly chasing the ball,” Ten Hag added. “And where we could, we try to play good football. But it’s a real pity we didn’t make it 2-1. “This sort of game gives the youngsters more self-confidence. Now they just have to convert their chances. “But this was a confirmation of what this team is capable of. We have quality players, who together can reach great heights.”
