The Lagos State Sector Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has warned commuters against throwing waste out of moving vehicles.  It said it could cause accident. An officer of the command, SP Adedotun Abayomi, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday at Ago Palace Way in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government that it was a bad habit that could lead to accidents and maybe, fatalities. He spoke against the backdrop of a quarrel between a commercial bus driver and a car owner, whose vehicle was affected when a passenger threw out of the window, a black nylon bag containing the waste of what she had consumed. The bag fell on the windscreen of Mr. Chinedu Okafor’s car, which almost caused an accident. The FRSC official, an assistant patrol commander, said it was wrong for people to drop things off from a moving vehicle because it was likely to cause accident. “Dropping off things from a moving vehicle is wrong. It is an offence known as “Failure to cover unstable materials’’, and it attracts N5,000 fine. “People need to stop throwing things off moving vehicles. Drivers should encourage their passengers use the dustbin in their vehicles, instead of throwing waste out of the buses,’’ he said. Okafor, who struggled to control his car when the object hit his windshield, told NAN he was sad about the development and advised people to stop the habit. “It is becoming a norm for people to drop things off while in a moving vehicle. It almost caused an accident for me today. “These days you see people throwing what they have eaten off their vehicles. Sometimes it is sachet of water, gala nylon, or even empty water bottle and so on. “Everyone should cultivate the habit of putting dirt in the dustbin of the vehicle to avoid dropping them off, which may cause accident and litter the environment,’’ he said.
