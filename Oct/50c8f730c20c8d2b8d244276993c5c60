The Cassava Adding Value for Africa (CAVA) II has donated a garri processing factory worth N16 million to Oyo State College of Agriculture and Technology (OYSCATECH), Igboora. The College Provost, Prof Gbemiga Adewale, said the donation was facilitated by CAVA II project Country Co-ordinator, Prof Lateef Sanni, who doubles as Chairman, Governing Council of the college. Adewale said: “Upon the assumption of office as the Governing Council Chairman of the College, Prof. Sanni used his good office to bring this laudable project to the institution. In addition to this, the college has been able to register OYSCATECH Ventures Limited and OYSCATECH Consult as parts of the efforts geared towards improving the internally generated revenue (IGR) of the College. “We are, indeed, grateful to Prof Sanni for his commitment and efforts at improving the internally generated revenue of the institution.” Adewale said work was still going on at the garri factory, while machines and other equipment meant for it have been delivered to the institution. “The Garri processing factory will be commissioned soon by Oyo State Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, where he would be assisted by the Governing Council Chairman, Prof. Sanni and the CAVA II Director, Prof.  Adebayo,” the Provost added. In his remarks, Prof Sanni said the factory will help the college become a large scale producer of OYSCATECH Garri.
