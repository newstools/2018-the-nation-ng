The Governing Council of the Ladoke  Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso, Oyo State, headed by Professor Dapo Afolabi, has directed that the proposed tuition fees in the institution be brought down to N140, 000 for indigenes of Oyo and Osun States while non indigenes be allowed  to pay N170,000, as against the N200,000 for indigenes of owner states and N250,000, for non indigenes. It also announced resumption for October 29, 2018. The management pleaded with “well wishers to come to the realisation that the cost of running qualitative and functional first grade technical institutions like ours are becoming unbearably impossible if N65,000 and 72,000 for indigenes of owner-states and non-indigenes are maintained.” It added that internally generated revenue from students’ fees would only remain supplementary as arrangements have been concluded to enlist parents and students into management of university fund in a manner that entrenches transparency and accountability.
