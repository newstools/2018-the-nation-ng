Kenneth Omeruo has told SCORENigeria he would be available for CD Leganes next La Liga game even though an injury forced him out of a 1-1 draw at Valencia at the weekend. The Chelsea loanee started the game at Valencia but was replaced in the 70th minute with Leganes still winning 1-0. “I got injured and I had to be replaced, but the injury is not serious, it was just a cramp and soon I will be back playing again,” central defender Omeruo assured. “We almost ran away with the victory, but unfortunately we conceded a late goal.  A point is better than nothing,” he reasoned. It is a good thing that I am getting playing time. I was eager to start playing and when the opportunity came I took it before the international break,” he told SCORENigeria. Leganes are 18th on the table with eight points from nine matches.
