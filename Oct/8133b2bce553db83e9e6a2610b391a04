Governor Mohammed Umar Jibrilla Bindow of Adamawa State has declared his loyalty to President Muhammadu Buhari’s candidacy for the 2019 presidential election. The declaration came against the background of the emergence of a son of the state,  Alhaji Atiku Abubakar,  as the presidential candidate of opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), a development which has devided an Adamawa State that was otherwise solidly behind Buhari. The state Commissioner of Information and Strategy, Mr Sajoh Ahmed, who spoke for Bindow at a press conference in the Government House in  Yola Monday, condemned what he described as a looming blackmail by elements who he said were planning to design a poster pairing Bindow with ‘the presidential candidate of another party’,  a ploy which he said was wicked and baseless. “Bindow is an APC governor working for APC and has no intention to support or canvass support for any presidential candidate outside APC. He has no support for any candidate other than Buhari,” he asserted,  adding that  anybody who prints any document to portray anything to the contrary should be disregarded. The commissioner who refrained from specifically mentioning Atiku’s name in his initial address,  submitted at the question and answer session of the press conference that Atiku as an Adamawa man winning the presidential ticket of a major opposition party was ‘a factor’ but that Bindow already had the candidate of his party and that Adamawa would always choose reality rather than promises. He said Buhari had done enough for Adamawa State since he became president to make the people prefer him to any other candidate.
