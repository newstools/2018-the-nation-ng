The Uwheru/Ohoror communities of Ughelli North local government area of Delta State, at the weekend, was thrown into mourning following the death of a father and son, who died mysteriously by the ravaging flood. The deceased whose names were given as Mr. Johnson Emegogoe, a motor-cycle mechanic and his second son, Mr. Benji Emegogoe were said to have gone for fishing when they met their untimely death. Narrating the incident to newsmen, one of the deceased cousins, Mr. Moses Young said the deceased had gone for fishing and until it was dark and until the following day before a search team was organized to look for them. Young said, “We cannot say what actually happened because none of us went with them, but a search party that went the following day only saw their dead bodies, but to ascertain how it happened we cannot. “What we suspected was the canoe they may have used for the fishing capsized and there was nobody there to rescue them and they probably struggled and died and this was as a result of the over flow of water. “This tragedy is much for us. If the incident had happened at the day time, may be someone would have walked into them and they would have been saved but what we suspected was that the incident happened in the dark when all had left the farm, hence no one could rescue them.
