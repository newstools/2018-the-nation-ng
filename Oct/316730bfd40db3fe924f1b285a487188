The Enugu State governor’s wife, Mrs. Monica Ugwuanyi, has urged parents, especially mothers, to ensure proper immunisation of their children at designated hospitals to enhance their health status as future leaders. Mrs. Ugwuanyi also urged the women to document the immunisation by ensuring that the dosage given to their children is recorded in their cards and presented to the doctors whenever it is time for the routine exercise, to avoid double dosage. The governor’s wife, who gave the advice during the kick-start of the first round of this year’s Maternal, New Born and Child Health Week at the Enugu State University of Science and Technology (ESUT) Teaching Hospital (Parklane), Enugu, also advised the women to always take their children to hospitals for proper treatment when they fall sick. She appealed to them to keep their children and environments clean, adding: “Anytime you want to clean a child’s mouth, wash your hands properly and make sure that the towels are clean. In case the towel falls down, drop it. Children are very delicate and should be treated with care.”
