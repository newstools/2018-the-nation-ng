A media strategist and Public Relations Consultant, Mrs. Adenike Fagbemi has urged the media to help curb the dominant rape culture in the country. Fagbemi made the call at a media round table organized by HACEY Health Initiative held last Friday in Lagos. She said the media is the most powerful tool that can change the people thought towards sexual violence because it fosters public attitudes towards issues of human interest. According to her, media practitioners can play a major role in curbing sexual assault by following up on sensitive cases and not just reporting it. “ The media is the  tool to create mindset that sexual violence is a crime and it’s penalties are real,” she stated.  Also speaking at the event, an activist on women’s right and film producer, Grace Edwin Okon said it is wrong to use the social media to stigmatize victims and make others afraid to speak up. “Victims should not be stigmatized, instead it should be the perpetrators. That attitude should stop so that people will suffer in silence,” Okon stated. Okon added that “the media should let the public know the cases of people who have been punished for the act to make them know that perpetrators can’t get away with the crime” The Director, Gender Programs at HACEY Health Initiative, Rhoda Robinson said the issue of sexual harassment should be taken more seriously as a crime that it is. “It should be a crime to the extent that people will have a second thought at the wages of their actions like that of stealing in the market.”
