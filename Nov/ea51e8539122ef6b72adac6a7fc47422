The Urhobo Progress Union America (UPUA) will hold a medical outreach on December 1 at Uvwiamuge-Agbarho, at 8 am, as part of activities marking the 2018 Urhobo Day, under the auspices of Urhobo Progress Union worldwide (UPU). The celebration will hold between November 29 and December 2. Beneficiaries will receive treatment on diabetes, hypertension, vision screening and counselling.  The programme is designed as an intervention and proactive exercise to tackle these medical challenges in Urhoboland. A statement by the Secretary-General, Dr. Felix Okpe, said: “UPUA is also using the opportunity of the Urhobo day celebration to bring awareness on the dangers of these medical conditions. UPUA is, therefore, calling on adult Urhobo sons and daughters to take advantage of this opportunity to get screened, and counselled on these medical issues, where necessary. “UPUA, an affiliate of UPU, is a North America-based non-profit umbrella organisation of Urhobo organisations, whose membership comprises Urhobo sons and daughters, and others who identify with the Urhobo culture and traditions by marriage and association. “UPUA membership is spread across United States and Canada. Part of UPUA’s objective and mission premised on unity, strength, and progress, include pursuing charitable causes in health care, education, and human capital development in Urhoboland. ‘’Through its charitable causes and intervention, UPUA has contributed to the unity and progressive development in Urhoboland over the years. ‘’UPUA’s representatives at the Urhobo day celebrations will be joined by volunteers during the medical outreach.”  This programme is a demonstration of UPUA’s commitment to qualitative and extensive access to health care in Urhoboland.”
