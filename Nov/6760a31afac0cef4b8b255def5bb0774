Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has picked his deputy, Benson Abounu, as running mate for next year’s election. In 2015, the governor lost the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship  primary and moved to the All Progressives Congress (APC) where the leader of the party, Senator George Akume, provided him with a platform to pick the ticket. Akume’s decision to give Ortom the ticket did not not down well with some aspirants, especially Emmanuel Jime, who seemed to be  coasting home to victory. But, Akume had his way. He also single handed chose Abounu as running mate to Ortom. The duo of Ortom and Abounu won the election in 2015. Things took a dramatic turn as Ortom dumped the APC which brought him to power for the PDP after three and half years in the saddle. His deputy, was silent throughout the meetings that led to Ortom’s defection . It took the promptings of reporters at a  function in the Government House before Abounu admitted that he will follow his boss to the PDP. When the governor negotiated his way back to PDP, it was a difficult time for Abounu, who was Commissioner for Water Resources and Environment under former Governor Akume. Abounu is not a novice when its comes to politics. He was the first politician from Benue South to contest for the position of a governor. Abounu’s long  silence on his next move generated controversy. There were rumours that he may be dropped for another candidate from Zone C. The choice of Abounu, as a running mate to Ortom was a hard one, but necessary for the governor. It was a matter of the “ the devil you know is better that the angel you don’t know“. Abounu is the chairman of Lobi Stars Football Club of Makurdi. Benson Abounu is a dutiful and loyal deputy. He never rocked the boat. He is humble, tested and trusted.
