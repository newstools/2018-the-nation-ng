The Oyo State government has said the September and October salaries approved by Governor Abiola Ajimobi have been paid to the civil servants and teachers on government employ. The Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism Mr. Toye Arulogun said the workers got their September salary late last week while the October salary had been paid this week. Arulogun said while the delay was regrettable, it was inevitable because of the imperative of due diligence to ensure accuracy of the actual payment. The commissioner said the ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) prepared the nominal roll for September in anticipation of the one-month salary payment, but the approval by the governor led to the urgent preparation of the October nominal roll, which passed through several processes. He added that the leadership of the workers’ unions was updated about the development to keep their members abreast of the situation. According to him, the government is working towards ensuring prompt payment of this month’s salary. Arulogun noted that with this payment, the government had paid all outstanding salaries of the civil servants and teachers on its payroll.
