The Government of Osun says it has closed two forest reserves in Irewole and Isokan communities over illegal activities of plank dealers. Prince Tunde Ajilore, the Special Adviser to Governor Rauf Aregbesola on Forestry, Natural and Mineral Reserves, made this known to newsmen on Friday in Osogbo. Ajilore said the closure was to ensure the state’s resources were not siphoned through illegal means. He said before the closure, the state government had held series of meetings with the plant dealers associations to put an end to such activities, but to no avail. “Some eminent personalities have intervened, but the association members have refused to embrace peace,” Ajilore said. He said the state government would not reopen the reserves until the dealers complied with the laws of the state, adding that the state government would not hesitate to deal with anyone found wanting. Mrs Yemisi Adetipe, the state Task Force Officer for Forest Reserves, said that offenders would not escape the wrath of the law. Adetipe said the primary responsibility of the ministry was to mobilize revenues for the state to boast its internally generated revenue. She called on stakeholders in the forestry, natural and mineral reserves sector to be calmed as the state government was on top of the situation. NAN
