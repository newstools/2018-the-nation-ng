Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has threatened to report former Governor George Akume to the Supreme Assembly of the Tiv Area Traditional Council for accusing the state government of masterminding the killings in the state. Ortom spoke at Tyulen in Guma Local Government Area during at the burial of Mama Roseline Adzuu, mother of the lawmaker representing Guma in the House of Assembly, Mr. Terseer Adzuu and the governor’s Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Administration, Frank Adzuu. The governor said since Akume, a senator and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), told President Muhammadu Buhari that militia herdsmen were not behind the killing of Benue residents, it implied that he has adequate knowledge about the killings. He challenged the senator to tell the traditional council details of what he knows. Ortom described as shocking and unfortunate, Akume’s utterances, saying they were clearly in favour of enemies of the state. The governor wondered why the former governor, who he said was expected to provide leadership to the younger generation, took sides with those he said had vowed to deprive his people of their ancestral land.
