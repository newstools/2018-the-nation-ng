Mr Olajide Mayiwakende, a physically challenged corps member posted to Kano State has appealed to the government and other well-meaning employers of labour to facilitate automatic employment for physically challenged graduates. The corps member made the call in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Tuesday in Kano. “If the society can, at least, provide some special platform for the physically challenged students and graduates in the country, the gesture will encourage others to pursue educational endeavours. “With this gesture, the number of physically challenged persons begging to survive would be greatly minimised, if not totally eradicated. “The assurance that after school and service, they will not labour in vain searching for jobs, will help in motivating others; especially those unsure of what awaits them in the future,” Mayiwakende said. He added that the gesture will also remove some burdens off the society and the able bodies, as the physically challenged would be able to take care of themselves, while contributing positively to the society. The graduate of Computer Science from Kwara State Polytechnic, bemoaned the practice where able body young boys and girls, who are supposed to be in schools, are often conscripted into taking physically challenged people around the town, soliciting for money or assistance.
