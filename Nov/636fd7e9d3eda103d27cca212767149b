Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, All Progressives Congress (APC) National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole and former governor of Akwa Ibom state, Obong Godswill Akpabio caused a disruption of the public presentation of a book on ex-President  Goodluck Jonathan’s book launch at Transcorp-Hilton, Abuja on Tuesday. A very jubilant crowd hailed and clapped as the three eminent Nigerians came in, wading through a thick crowd that includes many eminent citizens, including former leaders, Yakubu Gowon, Abdsalam Abubakar, diplomats and leaders from several African countries. The coincidence of their entry completely ‘marred’ the book review being presented by retired Justice Alfa Belgore as the audience’ jubilant exultations drowned out his voice and the giant loudspeakers. Oshiomhole stole the show when he walked up to former President Jonathan who rose from his front seat position, shook hands and warmly embraced him. The overcapacity audience at the Congress Hall of Transcorp-Hilton hotel, Abuja soaked in adulations of ex-President Jonathan whose 180-page book; “My Transition Hours” was being presented. Chief Host of the occasion, Governor Seriake Dickson who stated that his Bayelsa state gave Nigeria two great presents – crude oil and ex-President Jonathan- launched the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation with announcement of a N100m grant, six hectares of land and N5 million monthly support for administrative costs. Former President of Ghana, Mr. John Dramani Mahama, former Head of State, Gen Abdulsalam Abubakar, former Aviation minister, Osita Chidoka and others had, in turns, presented highly commendable remarks about Goodluck Jonathan and peaceful disposition that ensured smooth handing over to the current President in spite of other African leaders’ tendency to do otherwise.
