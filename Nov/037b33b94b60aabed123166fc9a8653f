Super Eagles player Jamilu Collins has told SCORENigeria the Nigerian team would have been a lot happier had they beaten Uganda in a friendly game played two days’ ago. Tuesday’s game in Asaba ended in a scoreless draw between the two teams who have already qualified for next year’s AFCON in Cameroun. “Uganda was aggressive and strong. We wanted to win this game, but unfortunately, it ended in a draw. It was not a bad result, but we would have got a better feeling had we won the game,” Germany-based defender Collins told SCORENigeria. The left-back has played five straight games for the Super Eagles since he made his debut in Liberia in October. “I am happy for the privilege given to me by my country and I thank God for everything,” he said. He said his target is to win promotion to the Bundesliga with Paderborn 07. “Our goal is to win promotion to the Bundesliga and I believe we will do that this season,” he said.
