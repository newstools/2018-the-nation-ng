Lagos State House of Assembly has raised from the 20 per cent advance payment for public project is longer feasible if jobs are to be speedily delivered, Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker Mudashiru Obasa said yesterday. He spoke at a public hearing on a bill seeking to amend the Lagos State Public Procurement Agency Law at the  Lateef Jakande Hall of the Assembly Complex. The stakeholders’ meeting was organised by the House Committee on Finance. Obasa said the review was aimed at making the law more functional so that people-oriented projects were delivered speedily in good quality. Represented by Deputy, speaker Wasiu Eshilokun-Sanni, Obasa said procurement was all about accountability, probity and reduction of corruption. He said the House would work for the people by having a procurement law that would serve them and ensure speedy delivery of infrastructural projects. “There are projects that require speedy completion. The delivery of government projects within reasonable time is key to the Assembly. “Our people desire services as early as possible. There are projects the government wants to finish in time, 20 per cent (advance payment) cannot work again and the law has to be dynamic. “We will ensure increase in the mobilisation fee for projects. The job cannot be completed in time with 20 per cent mobilisation.” Majority Leader Sanai Agunbiade noted that the extant law had 82 sections, saying the House saw some sections that should be changed to meet the present reality. He said the amendment affected Section 4, which dealt with appointment of the board by the governor, subject to the confirmation of the House, to have best hands.
