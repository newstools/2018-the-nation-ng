NIgerians have been urged  to invest in real estate as it  guarantees good returns. A Nollywood actor, Mr. Jide Kosoko, spoke at the unveiling of Rachel Oniga as  the new brand ambassador of Merit Abode Nigeria Limited. He explained that investment in real estate yields more profits than any other business, including oil. Kosoko, though admitted there could be phony real estate dealers,  urged  Nigerians to key into the opportunity the firm is making available to the public to empower them to have their properties. “All over the world there is no business as lucrative as real estate business,” he said. Describing the real estate firm as “responsive and responsible,” the actor said it is the reason he is staking his integrity and reputation with Merit Abode, adding that they are ready to assist investors to grow  irrespective of your income. This same integrity, according to the Merit Abode Managing Director, Oludotun Oseni, accounts for the firm’s choice of Oniga as her brand ambassador. “In real estate, credibility and integrity are paramount. For these Nollywood stars to stand with us, then it tells you of our credibility,” Oseni said. Similarly, Oniga urged  Nigerians to invest in real estate because of the long-term benefits. She said her decision to be an ambassador of the firm was borne out of her conviction, after investigations, that the organisation is responsible.
