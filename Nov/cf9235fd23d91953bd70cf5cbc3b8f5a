The Presidency on Monday night maintained that the Service Chiefs did not attend the launching of the Buhari/Osinbajo Next Level campaign flag off ceremony. The flag off of the campaign was done by President Muhammadu Buhari at the old Banquet Hall of the State House on Sunday. The camp of the former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who is the Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had criticized service chiefs attending such political functions. But reacting to the media report, the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, said that the service chiefs left the venue of the launching before the programme started. He said “Punch should have asked what brought the Service Chiefs to the “Next Level 2019” event at the State House, only to leave before it got underway. “They were mistaken in their assumption that this was a non-political event, to showcase the achievements of the administration, the success of which they are a part. “Hardly were they seated than did the Minister of Defence, Brigadier General Mansur Dan AlI (Rtd) ask them to leave as this was a political gathering. “They quickly left, even before the arrival of the President and for the event to get under way. “The fuss over this in therefore absolutely unnecessary.” he added
