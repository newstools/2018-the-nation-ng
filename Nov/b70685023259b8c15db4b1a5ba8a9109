 Stylish football on the pitch, stylish outfits off the field – that looks to be the unofficial motto of Barcelona football club. They jetted off from Spain on Tuesday afternoon ahead of their Champions League clash with PSV Eindhoven in Holland on Wednesday. The Barca players flew out in matching grey suits, complete with cardigans and warm woolly scarves. Barcelona have donned the fashionable – and expensive – gear before, wearing identical grey suits for their European away day against Tottenham last month. The outfit is designed by Thom Browne tailors, one of their global sponsors, which, including the white shirt with an Oxford tie, a 4-bar jacket vest and black shoes of grain leather of pebbles, comes to a grand total of £4,200. With 20 players in Barcelona’s travelling party, plus the manager, that’s around £100,000 worth of just travel gear. The Barca players will wear Thom Browne suits for the next three seasons for their trips to away Champions League matches. Lionel Messi looked particularly snug, his scarf wrapped tightly around his neck, adding to the insulation already provided by his impressive beard. Gerard Pique looked to be feeling the chill a little less, his scarf hanging open around his collar, while fellow centre back Samuel Umtiti chose to forgo his scarf altogether. Whatever their garments, Barca are home and cosy in Champions League Group B, securing qualification for the knockouts with two games to spare. Barca sit on 10 points at the summit of Group B, three points clear of Inter Milan. They will guarantee top spot if they beat winless PSV. They will however have to attain those crucial three points without striker Luis Suarez, who has been sidelined for two weeks with a knee injury.
