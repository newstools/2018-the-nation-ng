Fifteen passengers of a commercial bus have reportedly escaped death by the whiskers after the bus they were travelling in caught fire in Aba, Abia State. Eyewitnesses that claimed to have witnessed the incident told our reporter that the bus whose occupants conveying traders had cleared off the road to give chance for a passenger to alight at the popular Opobo junction, Ogbor Hill bus stop when it caught fire. Our reports gathered that there was commotion as passengers scampered to safety while the driver climbed to the roof of the bus throwing away luggage and tyre. Sympathizers were said to have brought several fire extinguishers to quench the fire, but it became intense. According to an eyewitness, Markson Dimkpa, “We were at the restaurant beside the road when the bus parked and in within a minute, it caught fire. People began to scream. Passengers hurriedly alighted; an elderly woman was quickly ferried out of the bus. Other people brought out fire extinguishers, but the fire grew in strength. The bus was totally burnt, but we thank God that no life was lost.” In an interview with our reporter,  one of the passengers identified as Victor , said they were returning   from a market in Akwa Ibom and had no problem on the road until the bus caught fire at the junction. Effort to contact the Director, Abia State Fire Service, Mr. Uche Eke, was unsuccessful as the time of fling this report.
