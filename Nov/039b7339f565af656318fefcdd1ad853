Innocent Udeme Udofot, known as MC Galaxy, has revealed that the secret of his success is giving. On Monday, he put a smile on the face of rising star comedian – Whalemouth’s parent when he paid a visit to their home and gifted the sum of N300, 000 cash to his mum, which he promised her during the comedian’s show which held on November 18, at the MUSON Centre. The Nigerian singer and songwriter, who reportedly rose to fame after winning the Davido dance competition in 2012, wrote, “@whalemouth1 you are real and I gat u for life.” Whalemouth expressed shock at the gesture. “I’m still in shock,” he wrote. “Thank you once again @mcgalaxy I didn’t invite you officially yet you came to honour me, performed for free and as well promised my mom, 300k. You were the first person to call me this morning and personally came to the hotel to give her the money. Only a few in the world can do this, especially in an industry where fake love is all that exists. @mcgalaxy my God will bless you. My Mum and Dad are so glad right now”. Actress etinosa Idemudia also speaking on the generosity of the entertainer wrote on her Instagram, “Awwwww @mcgalaxymcg also supported me when I was set to release my movie- The Washerman. He is bae for life! I’m sure if this was a scandal the gist would have trended smh. Please let’s learn to celebrate positivity; people with a heart of gold”.

And the video for the song, directed by Patrick Ellis, released June 2014, reportedly garnered over four million views on Youtube.
