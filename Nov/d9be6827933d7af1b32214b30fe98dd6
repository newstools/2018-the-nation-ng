Youths have been urged to shun illicit drugs to avoid destroying their lives. A representative of the Lagos State Kicks Against Drug Abuse School Campaign (LASKADA), Mrs. Adetayo Asagba, gave the advice yesterday at a youth summit held at Surulere Local Government Secretariat. Some drugs, she said, could be cheap, but their side effect was terrible. She said: “It starts with truncation of a vital body organ. It moves to the brain, it can lead to madness. Eventually if someone isn’t careful, it leads to death.” The summit was organised by the national Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), in conjunction with the Legislative Arm of the Surulere Local Government. Asagba, who delivered a lecture on drug abuse at the event, said: “We all have a very bright future ahead of us. Let’s not use our hands to destroy our lives. The use of illicit drugs will ruin us.” NYCN state Secretary Comrade Ridwan Tinubu said the cardinal objective for every youth organisation was to train the trainer. He said: ”As youths, you don’t need to think about what the government can do for you. You need to think about what you can do for the government. Youths should contribute their quota in terms of intellectual capacity to ensure the development of their communities.” House of Representatives Majority Leader Femi Gbajabiamila, represented by Mr. Alli Balogun, urged youths to be part of the electoral process. “Do not see yourself as future leaders. Rather, participate in the electoral process to be part of the ruling class. Our future is here. We are the leaders of today and tomorrow,” he said.
