Kwara North All Progressives Congress (APC) Elders Forum has urged the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the position of the deputy governor to the senatorial district. The forum, in its resolution at the end of a stakeholders meeting and signed by Senator Mohammed Ahmed (chairman, Kwara North Elders), Chief Wole Oke, Alhaji Abubakar Ndakene, Ezekiel Benjamin and Alhassan Bagidi said: “The position of the deputy governor be zoned to Kwara north in order to compensate our zone in view of the fact that the flag bearer of the party is from the central, while the state chairman is from the south. It is only fair to have the north to produce the deputy governor. “We therefore, appeal that our resolution which seeks for fairness and justice be respected in order to give our zone a sense of belonging. “The stakeholders caucus expressed reservation on the outcome of the just concluded governorship primary elections, the position which the zone believed rightly belonged to it in the principle of fairness and natural justice. It added: “However, as party loyalists and strong proponents of the liberation of the state from the age long oppressors and our unflinching support for our President Muhammadu Buhari, who recently called for peace and unity among party leaders and loyalists in order to guarantee our success at the 2019 polls, consequently, after due consultation and a meeting held with Kwara north critical stakeholders we unanimously agreed and settled for the deputy governorship slot.”
