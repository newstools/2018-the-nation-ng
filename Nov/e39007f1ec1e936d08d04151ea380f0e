THE National Examinations Council (NECO) has announced an extension for applicants wishing to register as walk-in candidates for its November/ December 2018 Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE). NECO is the first examination body in Africa to implement the walk – in candidate policy. Its Acting Registrar, Mr. Abubkar Gana, who stated this in a statement in Abuja, said the extension became necessary following the expiration of registration deadline on Saturday. Gana advised candidates who failed to meet the registration deadline to take advantage of the window of opportunity provided by the management and register for the examination as walk-in candidates. The NECO boss, however, urged candidates registering after the closing date to adhere to guidelines governing the process, warning that such candidates must complete their registration within 24 hours to the scheduled time of the paper(s) that they intend to sit for. He noted that a nonrefundable fee of N20,000 would be paid per candidate as registration fee to NECO TSA and evidence of payment presented at the NECO state office. “Candidates are to collect activated registration scratch cards from NECO State Office. Biometrics enrolment is mandatory for this examination. The November/December SSCE began yesterday and will end on Wednesday 19th December 2018.
