As part of activities to mark its 5th anniversary, management of the Kada Plaza Cinema and Entertainment Centre opened its doors to fete 120 orphans and disabled persons. It was the first time the beneficiaries would be entering the plaza. The orphans, drawn from four different orphanage homes, were given opportunity to enjoy various entertainment packages offered at the centre along with other kids. They were treated to free games ride at the Playtime Arcade section after which they watched a movie entitled The Nut Craker and the Four Realms. At 2:00 p.m., the management of Kada Plaza took the orphans on a guided tour of facilities and later treated them to lunch. Managing Director of Kada Plaza, Mr. Trevor Pillay, said it has become a tradition for the firm to always commemorate its anniversary with the less privileged in the society. Pillay said it was a way of making the less-privileged feel a sense of belonging to the society. Other activities to mark the 5th anniversary, according to Pillay, included free health check for members of the public at the Kada Health care and Pharmacy, Budweiser Party and Spend and Win promo. Pillay said Kada Plaza identified with the vision of the Edo State government in job creation as it has helped to reduce the state’s unemployment burden. He described the entertainment industry as a huge potential for job creation in Nigeria. Care givers of the orphans thanked the management of Kada Plaza for extending love to them.
