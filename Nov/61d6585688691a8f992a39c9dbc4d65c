The police in Lagos have arrested two suspected members of a gang that specialised in snatching vehicles around Lekki and Ajah. The suspects, Sunday Ikechukwu and Gabriel Collins were paraded yesterday by the state’s Police Commissioner, Mr Imohimi Edgal at the state Police Command Headquarters in Ikeja. It was gathered that Ikechukwu, the alleged leader of the gang, had on September 4, fled with his boss’ Honda Accord car with registration number LSD33DF. The suspect was said to have relocated to Ghana, while police operatives attached to the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) Ikeja were on his trail. Thinking that the matter had been forgotten, the suspect was said to have returned to Lagos, where he formed a four-man car snatching syndicate around Ajah. It was gathered that a fortnight ago, the gang snatched a Toyota Corolla car from its owner whom they locked inside the boot. Unknown to the suspects, the car had tracking device which enabled the owner to open the boot from inside and escaped. Undeterred, the suspects were said to have gone to the same neighbourhood they snatched the vehicle to sell it, but they were apprehended by policemen who have been tracking the vehicle. According to Edgal, the police recovered the Honda Accord stolen by Ikechukwu in September as well as the Toyota Corolla from the suspects, adding that efforts were on to arrest other members of the gang.
