Gambian referee, Bakary Papa Gassama will be in charge of the matchday 5 AFCON qualifier between South Africa and Nigeria on 17th November at the FNB Stadium in Soweto, AOIFootball.com reports. The 39-year-old is regarded as one of the best referees on the continent and was among the few Africans selected for the FIFA World Cup in Russia. This will not be the first time Gassama will be at the centre in Nigeria’s games as he officiated Nigeria’s 3-1 victory over Algeria in Uyo prior to the World Cup. Nigeria currently leads Group E with nine points from four matches, one point ahead of South Africa which has eight points from the same number of matches. The Super Eagles, however, need just a point to qualify, whilst South Africa will be targeting maximum points to end the hopes of Libya from reaching the tournament in Cameroun next year.
