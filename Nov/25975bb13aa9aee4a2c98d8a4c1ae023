A group, the Atiku-Agbaje Media Engagement Network (AAMEN), has described the alleged police occupation of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly as a coup by the All Progressives Congress (APC). It called for the removal of the Inspector General of Police, Alhaji Ibrahim Idris, for allegedly aiding and abetting the party in the dispute that has split the legislators into two camps. Highlighting the spate of anti-democratic abuses by the police under Idris, AAMEN said that the police IG had clearly lost his professional impartiality and demonstrated gross incapacity to provide the neutrality required in next year’s poll. AAMEN’s Director Felix Oboagwina, in a statement at the weekend in Lagos, described the police invasion of the House as a rape on democracy and constitution. The group pointed out that the IG had brazenly changed the Commissioners of Police in PDP-controlled Bayelsa State, where the state had seen eight CPs within two months. AAMEN said that the APC-controlled Federal Government had by its role in the Akwa Ibom House of Assembly’s impeachment saga demonstrated a total disregard and disrespect for the sanctity of the nation’s democracy. Describing the police as meddlesome interlopers in a purely legislative dispute, AAMEN asked other state houses of assembly to spend time on the matter. “Today, the police high command under Mr. Ibrahim Police constitutes the greatest threat to democracy in Nigeria,” Oboagwina said, warning, “It has become an ill-wind that promises no good for the coming elections. He must be changed.” AAMEN complained that instead of allowing Akwa Ibom legislators to democratically settle their conflict through the normal legislative and judicial channels, the police demonstrated uncommon partiality and joined the minority in the subjugation of the majority.
