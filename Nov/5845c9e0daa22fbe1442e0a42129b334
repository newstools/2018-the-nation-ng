First Bank Basketball Club surmounted their greatest challenge so far at the FIBA Africa Champions Cup for Women when they defeated FAP of Cameroun 69-66 to move into the semi-finals. The   Nigerians found it difficult to play their game leaving the initiative to the Camerounians, who used fast breaks to demystify the Nigerians, who are well-known for their defensive acumen. The four quarter scores were 16-15, 16-17, 20-15, 17-19 for a cumulative score of 69-66 in favour of the Nigerian team. First Bank’s Aisha Mohammed led the floor with 23 points, Nkem Akaraiwe had 15 points, while Ginett Mfutila Makiese contributed 13 points with no other Nigerian player getting double digit scores. For the Camerounians, Sandrine Meyini Ayangma had 16 points, Ange Jolie Lonteu Tsafack had 13 points, while Amandine Eboga Fabo, Talisa Le’shay Boyd and Alexandra Green contributed 10 points apiece. The game was a narrow escape for the Nigerians who trailed with less than a minute left but had to rely heavily on experience  to edge out the  Camerounians. The Camerounians made use of fast breaks while their bench also contributed more points than the First Bank bench. First Bank’s coach, Peter Ahmedu had predicted a difficult game but what he might not have guessed was the Camerounians pushing his team to the end of the tie. He  hopes  his team will raise their game in tomorrow’s semi-final against host Ferroviario.
