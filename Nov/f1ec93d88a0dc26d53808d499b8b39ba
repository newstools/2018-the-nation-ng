The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State has pledged to support Governor Gboyega Oyetola, who assumed office on Tuesday. A statement in Osogbo, the state capital, by the party’s Chairman Gboyega Famodun, said: “We are grateful to God for the smooth transfer of power from the former governor to the incumbent, who has been at the core of policy designs and implementation of the former government of the party. “This seamless transfer of power, which Osun badly needed, ensures that the continuity of the success of the previous administration will be an important template on which the new administration will build. “We, as dedicated leaders of the party, have absolute confidence in the current governor to perform creditably in taking Osun to another level of development. “We, therefore, pledge our loyalty and continued support for the governor in his effort to make Osun a much better place than he took over from the exceptional Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola. “We wish the governor and people of the state the best that they possibly can have.”
