 Indications that Cristiano Ronaldo and girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez are set to move their relationship to the next level emerged on Saturday as they were sighted searching for ideal venue to formalise their wedding. Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodriguez became engaged last week, according to a report. The pair were spotted visiting Church of Gran Madre di Dio in Turin, Italy as they began the search for a potential wedding venue for their upcoming nuptials. The stunning brunette, 24, had her exquisite engagement ring on display as she strolled along with her husband-to-be, 33, after popping into the 19th century church, which features in the 1969 film The Italian Job. Georgina scraped her long raven tresses away from her face and styled into a low, sleek ponytail, with a central parting. The mother-of-one, who also helps to raise Ronaldo’s three other children, opted for a minimal make-up look, with just a heavy dusting of bronzer to give her a healthy glow. She carried the metallic handle of a luxe pillar-box red tote in her hand, and accessorised with a delicate gold necklace, featuring a cross pendant. Ronaldo looked equally stylish in a pair of Nike tracksuit bottoms, and a coordinating sports jacket, with the hood pulled up over his head. The sports star strolled along in fresh-out-of-the-box white trainers, with a protective arm placed around Georgina’s shoulder. On Thursday, Portugal’s best-selling newspaper Correio da Manha claimed the Spanish beauty had accepted and has begun trying on wedding dresses. The pair have been living as man and wife in Italy and have a one-year-old daughter Alana Martina. Georgina, who has backed the Juventus player amid claims he raped an American woman in Las Vegas in 2009, is helping raise the footballer’s other three children.
