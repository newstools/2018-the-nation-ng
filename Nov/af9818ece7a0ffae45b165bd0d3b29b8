Mr Lawrence Shabwet, a philanthropist, and director with the Plateau education ministry, has donated 190 text books to Government Secondary School Shimanka, in Shendam Local Government of Plateau. Shabwet, who presented the books at the school on Wednesday, said that the gesture was aimed at restocking the school’s library so as to revamp the students’ reading culture. “The measure is to rejuvenate the reading culture in the community and encourage more students to patronize the library,” he said. The philanthropist emphasised the need for everyone to contribute to reviving the reading culture, saying that it was  not right to leave everything to the government alone. Mr Samuel Datukun, the principal of the school, while thanking the donor for the gesture, said that the books would restore more life to the library. “The text books will spur the students to use the library more regularly; most of the books are new and modern and will be very useful for us,” he said. A student, Miss Mercy Damap, who thanked the donor for the kindness, said that she would now make good use of the library. “I am happy about this development because I ca now borrow text books that I do not have,” she said. The 190 textbooks cover subjects like Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Further Mathematics, English Language and Literature. Others included Social Studies, Economics, French, Computer Science and Religious Studies. NAN
