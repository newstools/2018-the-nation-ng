Lagos State Government has empowered 50 unemployed youths with Oracle workforce technology skills. The beneficiaries underwent a training programme organised by the Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment, in conjunction with Oracle Nigeria. Five graduating students have been employed by companies at the event. At the graduation ceremony held yesterday at Adeyemi Bero Hall, Alausa, Ikeja, Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment Mrs. Uzamat Akinbile-Yussuf urged the students to use the knowledge acquired to develop the society. She said the government would sustain the programme as part of its vision to reduce unemployment. The commissioner said: “The programme addresses the growing shortage of skilled employees in the global technology industry by allowing you to offer Oracle authorised training combined with the internationally recognised Oracle certification. ‘’Acquiring skills in latest technologies will help you to become better collaborators, communicators, critical thinkers, innovators, problem solvers and citizens of our global economy. More than 50 per cent of people today require some degree of technology and skills. Experts say that percentage will increase to 77 per cent in the next decade. The government has spent so much to make you employable in this line and so, you must reciprocate the gesture by giving back to the society. Don’t stop on this level, invest on further stages so that you can really become experts in the programme.’’ Oracle Nigeria, Managing Director Adebayo Sanni, urged the students to update their skills, to improve their performance at work. He said: “Whatever knowledge you have acquired is going to impact on how you transform and conduct your business. Hence, you need to update your skills constantly.’’
