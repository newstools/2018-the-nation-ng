Lagos State will continue with its laudable programmes in order to retain its position as the country’s industrialisation hub, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has said. He spoke during the 2018 Africa Industrialisation Day celebration organised by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives. Represented by Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Mrs Olayinka Oladunjoye, Ambode said the projects embarked upon by the government were designed to create an enabling environment for industrialisation and sustain the state’s status as a prime investment destination. The task before the government, he said, was to encourage private sector participation through the implementation of policies and practices beneficial to the productive sectors of the economy. Ambode assured Lagosians of an open door policy aimed at harnessing productive potential, using the private sector as a vehicle of economic growth. The government, he said, was not oblivious of the challenges confronting entrepreneurs, stressing that it would engage the private sector to develop appropriate and sustainable solutions. A faculty member at the Lagos Business School (LBS), Salaudeen Jubril, said promoting regional value chains would accelerate regional, international trade and investment flows, increase competitiveness and facilitate industrialisation of many economies.
