No fewer than 1, 189 pensioners on Wednesday sued the Nasarawa State Government  before the National Industrial Court of Nigeria (NICN), Makurdi, over nonpayment of gratuity and pension arrears.  Addressing the court, counsel to the claimants (pensioners), Mr Sunday Okpale, said that his clients were being paid monthly pensions in percentages since September 2016.  The counsel said that the case was scheduled for hearing, but the respondents – the state government, the state pensions board and the board’s director-general – were not represented in court.  He, therefore, prayed the court to grant summary judgment in the case to compel the government to pay his clients the balance of their entitlements. Justice Salish Danjida adjourned the case until Feb. 11, 2019, for summary judgment NAN
