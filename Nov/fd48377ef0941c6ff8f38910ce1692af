 Zlatan Ibrahimovic is ‘close’ to rejoining AC Milan on a six-month loan deal once the transfer window reopens in January. The LA Galaxy star has recently revealed that it is ‘no secret’ the Serie A giants would like to see him back at the club as the two parties continue to discuss a potential move. According to Italian news outlet, La Gazzetta dello Sport, it appears the reunion is likely to happen with the possibility of making the move permanent in July. While Ibrahimovic has admitted that Milan are interested, he insisted that he was in no position to discuss whether he had a future at the club. He told Vanity Fair: ‘There’s interest, but I’d be fine spending another year in LA. It’s no secret that Milan like me. I had two wonderful years there and didn’t want to leave, but they “forced” me to go to Paris. ‘We won things, I ran out top scorer at a great club with a great atmosphere, plus the old guard was still there. They were an incredible group of players, with whom I was lucky to play and win. And I know what it means to win in Italy. ‘I’ve played for the three biggest clubs in Italy: Juventus, Milan and Inter. Milan treated me well: I came from Barcelona, where I’d experienced sadness, but Milan put a smile back on my face. I wanted to repay them. ‘I won’t say “no” and I won’t say “yes”. We’ll see… [Gennaro] Gattuso was a great player and is a great coach. ‘When I watch Milan’s games, I see how all his players love him. When you win with people like him, and we’ve won the Scudetto and Supercoppa together, it’s wonderful. Good times.’ A deal for the 37-year-old could see him return in the same way David Beckham did in 2009, who was also playing for LA Galaxy in the latter stages of his career. Ibrahimovic has enjoyed his short stint in the MLS since making his move from Manchester United and has scored 22 goals in 27 appearances. He is currently under contract with LA Galaxy until December 31, 2019.
