Alebiosu opened his goal account in the 12th minute of the encounter. The potent striker had connected well with Owoansaya’s assist, rounded the goalkeeper and buried the ball in back of the net. Odeyemi then doubled the lead eight minutes later after being set up by Alebiosu. Valentine Nwabili pulled one back for Almar FC in the 43rd minute before Alebiosu made it three with a powerful strike after receiving a lovely pass from Samsudeen Hashimu.
