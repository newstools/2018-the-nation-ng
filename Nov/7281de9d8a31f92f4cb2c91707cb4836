The party described the agitations by the group as a ruse, adding that such arrangement has no place in APC’s Constitution. Olanusi’s group, under the aegis of “Concerned Ondo APC leaders,” paraded other members like Isaac Kekemeke, Chiefs M. A. Akeju, Felix Ayegbusi, Bode Sunmonu, Chief Adewale Omojuwa and several others. They sought the dissolution of state executives to pave the way for a caretaker committee that would work for the victory of President Muhammadu Buhari and other candidates ahead of the 2019 elections. The group maintained that the estranged members constitute more than 80 per cent of APC stakeholders in the state as against 20 per cent of “Team Aketi”.
