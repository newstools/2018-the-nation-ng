Super Falcons’ head coach, Thomas Dennerby has warned that any of the foreign-based players who failed to report on or before the November 4 deadline will be dropped as preparations intensifies for the 2018 Africa Women’s Cup of Nations. However, the deadline hammer will not fall on the duo of Asisat Oshoala and Onome Ebi who have been excused by the Falcons’ coach due to club engagements in China. Both players are expected to hit the team’s Jubilee Chalets and Resorts in Epe on November 6 as the Chinese Female League ends on Sunday. “I know there are a lot of teams going into the competition to stop us and female football in Africa is developing fast but notwithstanding, we need to win to be among the three best teams to enable us to qualify for the world. We really need to go for the World Cup in France and as a coach I know I am under pressure to deliver but I have been in the business for long and I know what exactly I need to do and I am not scared for now,” he said. In a chat with NationSport, the coach said all the foreign- based players will undergo medicals on arrival, as only fit players will make the team. Nigeria has been drawn in Group B along with South Africa, Kenya and Zambia.
