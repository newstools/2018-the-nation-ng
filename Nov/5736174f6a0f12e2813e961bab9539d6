First Bank Basketball Club surmounted their stiffest challenge so far at the FIBA Africa Champions Cup for Women when they defeated FAP of Cameroun 69-66 to set up a clash against host, Ferroviario in the semi-finals. The quarter final game didn’t go according to script as the Nigerians found it difficult to play their usual free-flowing anchored on strong defence. This gave the Camerounians the confidence to seize initiative. FAP deployed fast-breaks to good effect as they demystify the Nigerians, who are well-known for their defensive acumen. The four quarter scores were 16-15, 16-17, 20-15, 17-19 for a cumulative score of 69-66 in favour of the Nigerian team. First Bank’s Aisha Mohammed led the floor with 23 point, Nkem Akaraiwe had 15 points, while Ginett Mfutila Makiese contributed 13 points with no other Nigerian players getting double digit scores. For the Camerounians, Sandrine Meyini Ayangma had 16 points, Ange Jolie Lonteu Tsafack had 13 points, while Amandine Eboga Fabo, Talisa Le’shay Boyd and Alexandra Green contributed 10 points apiece. The game will go down as a narrow escape for the Nigerians who trailed with less than a minute to go but had to rely heavily on experience to edge the dogged Camerounians. The Camerounians were the fitter side making use of fast break, while their bench also contributed more points that the First Bank’s Bench. First Bank’s coach, Peter Ahmedu had predicted a difficult game but what he might not have bargained for was the Camerounians pushing his team to end of the tie. He looked relieved after the game and will be hoping that his teams raise their game in tomorrow’s semi-final against host Ferroviario who beat Kenya Ports Authority 73-40. In the other semi final game, Inter Club of Angola will take on Victoria Club of Congo.
