Super Eagles’ defender Leon Balogun has been ruled out of Tuesday’s international friendly between Nigeria and the Cranes of Uganda in Asaba. NationSport gathered that Balogun sustained a knock while on duty for Nigeria in a 2019 AFCON qualifier against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg last Saturday and had to return to England for further treatment. The Brighton central defender will, therefore, join Kenneth Omeruo as the two players excluded from the 23-man squad ahead of the friendly on Tuesday. As the Super Eagles, Uganda has also qualified for next year’s AFCON in Cameroon after they pipped visiting Cape Verde 1-0 at home on Saturday. The Nigerian delegation arrived in Asaba yesterday on a chartered flight ahead of the friendly on Tuesday.
