 Super falcons bounced back into contention on Wednesday after hitting shepopolo of zambia 4-0 in their second game of theÂ  ongoing African Women Nations cup in Ghana. The Falcons who lost their opening match to South Africa by a lone goal, improved their performance against Zambia, a complete departure from uncoordinated display witnessed in the opening match. Desire Oparanozie opened scoring for the Falcons as the team maintained the lead till the end of the first half. On resumption of the second half the Nigerians increased the tempo producing three goals thanks to, Francesca Ordega, Rashidat Ajibade and late substitute Amarachi Okoronkwo. It was however not the best of days for Assisat Oshoala as she missed no fewer than four scoring chances. She had before the match declared that the team will fight to the finish, a commitment which came to pass without her name on the score sheet. The team will next take Equatorial Guinea on Saturday in the last group game
