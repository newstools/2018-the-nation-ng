Nigeria is among African countries that would benefit from a $120 million African Development Bank (AfDB) Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) project. TAAT Coordinator,  Krishan Bheenick made this known  during a Capacity Development and Technology Outreach programme organised by the Forum for Agricultural Research in Africa (FARA) in partnership with the AfDB, TAAT yesterday in Abuja. He said the seed fund which will be made available in tranches of $40, 000, is meant to support 40, 000 farmers in Africa including Nigeria’s seven major agricultural commodities listed to benefit in the intervention. According to him, AfDB is planning to mobilise a total of $800 million to implement the project across the three years of execution. Speaking on the importance of the train-the-trainers workshop, Bheenick said attention should not really be about the fund, but the expected impact it would make on the grassroot farmers across the value-chain. He said: “It is $120 million in total. It’s in three ways of funding of $40 million each time. The current span of the project is between 2018 and 2021, so it’s about four years for the seed money for investment. The bank itself is first of all expecting the countries to invest money either they get it through a grant or loan and also other donors and international agencies can join the programme. “One other figure that has been mentioned is that across the continent, we are expected to reach 40 million farmers. In terms of the fund we are trying to mobilise for the implementation of the project is around $800 million. But the issue is that it is not so much how much money but how effective because if we are able to convince the countries that these are worth investing in, that’s when they will invest. The communities also need to invest their own time, efforts in terms of mobilisation.”
