Persons Living With Disabilities (PLWD) in the South East states have launched a campaign to immortalize two of their own, late Prof. Chinua Achebe and Chimezue Nwizu. The group, under the auspices of Initiative for Eradication of Poverty and Employment of the Disabled (IFEPED), said the choice of late Achebe as a literary icon from Anambra State was informed by his impact in the literary world. Addressing newsmen on Friday at Cathedral Church of St Mary, Uruagu Nnewi, President of the group, Victor Clifford said Nwizu who died as the leader of the PLWDs in Imo state would be also immortalized with Chimezie Nwizu Competition. He explained that the competition would offer opportunities for youth empowerment through sports and academics, using ministry of education and that of youth and sports of the South East States as facilitators. He said, “The immortalization will take the form of setting up a platform called Chinua Achebe Literary Writers for the purposes of forming a group of writers amongst the physically challenged who will assist one another in literary profession like writing of books, editing, publication and book launch. “If late Prof. Chinua Achebe and Chimezie Nwizu had not made themselves notable in society, they would not have been immortalized by IFEPED. “If the Zarephath woman in the Bible had not taken the risk of giving Prophet Elijah part of the remaining food in her home, she would not have received favour from God.” According to Clifford, IFEPED had produced 2,000 and 3,000 copies of its magazine and almanac, respectively, to be launched across the South East zone to ensure a level of self-reliance for members of the group. He appealed for support from the South East governors and other philanthropists in establishing office of Chinua Achebe Literary Writers and sponsorship of Chimezie Nwizu Competition in academics and sports.
