Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, wife of Ondo State Governor, has called on non-governmental organisations to raise awareness on cancer and its impact in the country. She made this call in Abuja at a music and comedy fund raising show organised by Project Pink Blue, a cancer non-profit campaign organisation. Mrs Akeredolu, a breast cancer survivor, noted that cancer can be defeated when people are enlightened about the ailment and the need to go for regular checkups. According to her, the idea of referring the ailment to spiritual attack is contributing to the high rate of preventable deaths in the country. “I am a 21 years cancer survivor and I am still alive, but the entry point to defeating cancer is education. “Education is very important in the fight against any type of cancer but in this our environment, we are held back by all sort of misconceptions on what causes cancer and how it can be treated. “We attribute it to spiritual attack, so instead of going to the hospital, we keep going to prayer mountain thereby wasting time. “People do not know that early detection is the key but we find out that by the time victims report to the hospital, their cases would have gotten to Stage 3 or Stage 4,” she said. She also called on Nigerians to make financial support to the treatment of cancer victims in the country. A male breast cancer survivor, Mr Chuks Igbokwe, advised Nigerians to regularly check themselves of lumps in their breast area and also go to the hospital for mammogram check. “The public should be aware that breast cancer is not exclusive to females only but men can also be victims of it.
“I implore everyone to always check themselves and also get themselves enlightened about the disease,” he said. Fund were raised by ‘auctioning’ various celebrities and artists in the entertainment industry at the event. The celebrities include Alex Unusual, Rachael Okoronkwo, Kemen, Ex-Mr Nigeria Bryan Okwara and Denrele Edun. NAN
