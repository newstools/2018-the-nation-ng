The House of Representatives is to investigative the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Adikwu, a key suspect in the Offa, Kwara State, bank robbery. The incident, which occurred seven months ago, claimed many lives. The Committee on Police Affairs, Human Rights and Justice mandated to carry out the investigation, is expected to uncover the issues and answer questions as to when the suspect died, how he died, why the police denied the facts of his death, at what point the police leadership discovered the death of the suspect and why the police are covering up the facts. The committee is also expected to unravel issues of human rights abuse, extrajudicial killings and manipulation of criminal investigation by the police. The decision of the lawmakers followed the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance by Zakari Mohammad (PDP, Kwara), who noted how shocking was the disclosure by the police that Adikwu, the principal suspect in the bank robbery in Offa, Kwara State, which occurred on Aprii 5, is dead. He said: “The police initially confirmed to the Attorney- General of Kwara State through the Police Public Relations Officer, Moshood Jimoh, that the principal suspect was alive and in custody and was helping the police in the investigations of the robbery that led to the killing of 22 people and recovery of firearms that were carted away. “Of concern, however, is that it took the police so long to make the disclosure about the death of the principal suspect after denying its veracity as was reported in the media. “It is equally worrisome that there have been inconsistencies in the various statements by the police and a possible cover up of this extra-judicial killing with the aim of tarnishing the image of some innocent individuals for political purposes. “It is common knowledge that it is the constitutional duty of this hallowed chamber to take action wherever such level of irresponsibility and recklessness of an important law enforcement agency such as the Police have arisen in the course of investigations into a vicious crime.”
