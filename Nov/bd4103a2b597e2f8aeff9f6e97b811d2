The Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday reduced the examination registration fees for the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Senior Secondary and Basic Education Certificate. This was disclosed by the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu at the end of the FEC meeting. He said that the JAMB fee for the UTME will reduce from N5, 000 to N3, 500, the Senior Secondary School fee charge by NECO will reduce from N11, 350 to N9, 850 and the Basic Education certificate by NECO will reduce from N5, 500 to N4, 000. According to him the new charges would become effective from January, 2019. Noting that most of the past high examination fees were unnecessary, he said that they were siphoned into private pockets. He also pointed out that the agency is not a revenue generating agency and its focus should not be to generate money. “In response to the yearnings by parents, the President directed the Ministry to look into it.” He said The Minister also said that the reduced fees have nothing to do with the forthcoming general elections.
