CHI Ice Tea from Chi Limited is now Chivita Ice Tea. As part of the rebranding seen as a strategic move to integrate with the Masterbrand Chivita, Chivita Ice Tea now comes in a new product pack with the promise of the same refreshing goodness. With an exciting logo that reflects its new positioning under the Chivita Masterbrand, the product’s innovative back of pack prominently features its health benefits, product quality and consumer benefits. The pack’s design also has a top to bottom label that is bolder, visually disruptive and combines perfectly with the colour pallet. The Marketing Director of Chi Limited, Mr. Probal Bhattacharya said that the overall objectives of developing a fresh visual identity for the ice tea is essential not only to key the product into the Chivita Masterbrand, but also to reinforce its attribute of rejuvenation through more appealing visuals that evoke its refreshingly natural goodness. According to him, “Chivita ice tea’s new pack design aims to communicate the brand’s core value of rejuvenation and natural refreshment with essential imageries that are attractive and differentiating.’ Made from premium natural tea leaves with delicious fruity flavours, it is available in two variants of lemon and peach.
