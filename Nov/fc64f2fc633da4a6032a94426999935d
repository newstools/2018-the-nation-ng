The Lagos State Citizens Mediation Centre (CMC) resolved 36,788 disputes between January and last month, its Director, Mrs. Omotola Rotimi, has said. She spoke in Yaba, Lagos Mainland, at the weekend during a road show to mark this year’s World Tolerance Day (WTD). Rotimi said the resolved cases were from the 40,875 disputes handled by the centre. According to her, the resolved cases include landlord-tenant, property inheritance, marital and child custody disputes as well as monetary claims. The centre, she said, was interested in decongesting the prisons and police cells, adding that people had begun to embrace Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), rather than going to court. Rotimi said the WTD was celebrated to sensitise the public on the need for tolerance, which could be a tool for solving the problems of nations, cities, among others, if embraced. She said tolerance at home would reduce domestic violence, rape and child molestation and advised parents and guardians to embrace it. Tolerance at the motor parks, she added, would prevent hooliganism and clashes. Rotimi said: “There is need for tolerance at the workplaces because there is bound to be dispute. In the markets, tolerance will make traders to operate in peace and prevent fighting. Drivers too should learn to tolerate one another to promote peace. “Tolerance will save lives; it will prevent fathers from killing their children. With tolerance, we will reduce domestic violence.”
