The governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, on Friday, met with party leaders from across the state, assuring that aggrieved members, including Governor Ibikunle Amosun, would be appeased. Abiodun said the party primaries have come and gone, but added that the important things today are reconciliation of all members because of the crisis arising from the primaries and forge a “common front” as team to deal with the electoral contest ahead. The oil magnate who spoke with reporters at the residence of former governor, Segun Osoba, in Ibara GRA, Abeokuta, the state capital, shortly after the political meeting there, described Amosun as his “long time friend.” Abiodun noted that the fact that there was a disagreement between them over the primaries, does not negate both still being members of APC. He added that the disagreement is a “party family issue” that would be resolved, assuring that the Ogun State APC would enter 2019 electoral contest “strong and united.” He disclosed that his running mate would come from Ogun West Senatorial district, and pledged to improve the welfare of civil servants, particularly teachers in the state. He also pledged to embark on aggressive agricultural drive to enhance food supply and create jobs for the state’s teeming youth. Abiodun promised to improve the state’s current Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) by harnessing all her potentials if elected into power in 2019.
