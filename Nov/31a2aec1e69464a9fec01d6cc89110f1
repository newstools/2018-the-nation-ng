Defence Minister Brig-Gen Mansur Dan-Ali is billed for N’djamena, Chad’s capital this week. His mission is to discuss with his Chadian counterpart Gen. Daoud Yaya on how best to respond to the worsening security crisis along the Nigeria – Chad border. The trip is coming in the wake of rising insurgency in the Northeast, especially the November 18 attack on troops at the 157 Task Force Battalion in Metete, a remote village in Borno State, on the Nigeria- Chad border. Scores of soldiers were allegedly killed by insurgents who invaded the camp in military uniforms as friendly soldiers. The Boko Haram fighters allegedly killed the Battalion Commander and those who were with him in the office before other insurgents who laid a siege swooped on the camp. Brig-Gen Ali’s Public Relations Officer Col. Tukur Gusau confirmed the scheduled meeting in a statement yesterday. According to the statement, the Defence minister’s visit was in continuation of consultations with the defence ministers of countries involved in the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF). The MNJTF troops contributing countries (TCC) are: Cameroon, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin Republic. Brig.-Gen. Dan- Ali was in Niger Republic last month over similar issue. He held bilateral discussions with his Nigerien counterpart, Brigi Rafini. Col Gusau said in the statement: “The visit is in continuation of consultations with Ministers of Defence of Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) Troops contributing countries (TCC) which include Cameroun, Chad, Niger, Nigeria and Benin Republic. “Recall that the minister paid a similar visit to Niger Republic in September during which he held a similar bilateral discussion with his Nigerien counterpart. ”The  minister’s visit to Chad will revolve around strengthening the operations of the MNJTF to enable it achieve its mandate of eliminating security threats and creating a safe and secure environment in its area of responsibility.”
