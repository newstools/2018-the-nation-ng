There is so much that brings this continent together, and film is a wonderful vehicle for showcasing these things. We are here to empower AFRIFF year after year, because the work they do is important to celebrating works Born in Africa.” The event was attended by celebrities from the film industry across the continent, including Chioma Omeruah (Chigul), Lala Akindoju, Dede Michelle, Rita Dominic, Ini Edo, Uche Jombo, Kemi Adetiba, Omotola Jalade Ekeinde, Kunle Afolayan, Charles Novia, and Ego Boyo.
