Former President Goodluck Jonathan’s aide on Thursday raised alarm over fake online versions of his book, ‘My Transition Hours’. This was disclosed in a statement issued on Thursday by his media aide, Ikechukwu Eze. It reads “We have just been informed that a fake document contrived by mischief makers, and being passed on as the e-version of the just launched ‘My Transition Hours’, a book by Dr. Goodluck Jonathan, is now circulating online.” The general public was advised to ignore such publication as the chapters and contents are not the same as the book publicly presented two days ago in Abuja by the former President. “We note that the e-copy of ‘My Transition Hours’ is not being marketed, as such, the fake online version could only have been created by those out to deceive the unsuspecting public.” it stated.
