The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and CDC Group Plc have signed a $100-million master risk participation agreement to support Afreximbank’s Trade Facilitation Programme. Under the terms signed in Casablanca, Morocco, CDC will provide unfunded risk participation to Afreximbank as the Bank provides trade finance products that include trade confirmation services; trade confirmation guarantee; and irrevocable reimbursement undertakings. Speaking during the signing ceremony, Amr Kamel, Afreximbank’s Executive Vice President for Business Development and Corporate Banking, said that agreement will support Afreximbank’s trade confirmation services under which the Bank provides confirmation lines to African financial institutions to support their trade businesses and increase capacity to undertake trade finance transactions. It will also support the Afreximbank Trade Confirmation Guarantee Programme, which offers full guarantee to international banks on behalf of African financial institutions, with the aim of resolving the issue of lack of credit limit by international/confirming banks for the African counterparts or situations of limited credit limit due to capacity constraints, among others. Also speaking, Admir Imami, Director, Supply Chain Finance and Trade Finance of CDC, who signed on behalf of his company, said CDC was excited at the opportunity to work with Afreximbank and looked forward to many more joint projects and deals in the future. Also speaking at the just concluded Afreximbank structured trade finance in Casablanca, Kamel said structured trade finance offers Africa a vital pathway to boosting intra-African trade and increasing the continent’s global exports. Addressing the opening of the Fundamentals of Structured Trade Finance Seminar and Workshops, he regretted that Africa still suffered from a deficit of expertise in structured finance even though it was widely acknowledged as a highly effective trade financing tool. He said Afreximbank remained committed to equipping African financiers with the knowledge required to structure bankable trade and trade related project finance transactions. “This 18th Structured Trade Finance Seminar progresses Afreximbank’s goal of strengthening the capacity of its partners and clients in understanding trade and trade-related project financing issues as they affect Africa and is driven by the widening trade financing gap and the challenge of increasing the continent’s share of global trade,” he said. Kamel added that Africa had much to learn from the economic transformation of Morocco, noting that “Many years of modernising and expanding its infrastructure has successfully transformed Morocco into a commercial crossroads between Africa and the West.” In her address on behalf of the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco,  Zaaboul thanked Afreximbank for having chosen Morocco to host the seminar which represents a platform for learning and exchange on an important theme relating to structured trade finance Zaaboul stressed the role that intra-African trade can play in structuring development, especially as a vector of regional integration The Structured Trade Finance seminar and workshop is being attended by more than 200 participants and experts from across the globe, including executives of banks, law firms and other financial institutions, senior government officials and financial regulators as well as corporates actively engaged in the promotion and financing of African trade and trade-related projects.
