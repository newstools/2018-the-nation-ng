Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, Dr. Femi Majekodunmi, yesterday urged Governor Ibikunle Amosun to resolve the bickering on the party’s governorship candidate and not play a “spoiler game”. Majekodunmi addressed reporters at the weekend in Abeokuta, the state capital. Ogun is among the states where the APC is having a crisis over its governorship candidate with Amosun insisting on his preferred choice, Adekunle Akinlade, to be the party’s candidate while the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) submitted the name of Prince Dapo Abiodun. Majekodunmi, who is the Baagbile of Egba land, urged the governor to take cognisance of the fact that he is generally regarded as the architect of modern Ogun State because of his achievements. The APC chieftain urged the governor to avoid taking a political decision that would consign his name into political oblivion. The General Medicine practitioner-turned politician also advised Amosun not to work against the interest of the APC, saying the worth of a statesman is championing the interest of all. Majekodunmi said the governor cannot afford to let the party down by playing a spoiler game. The APC chieftain warned that doing so would be counter-productive with grave implications on his good name, which he had built over the years. He noted that the governor had served the people diligently for over seven years with landmark achievements. According to him, history will be kind to him, if he allows reason to prevail and he works for the victory of the party at the state and federal levels.
