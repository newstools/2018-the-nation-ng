A travel consultant, Babatunde Gbadamosi, who allegedly obtained N1,050,000 from 22 Nigerian students and issued them forged Canadian admission letters, was on Thursday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Gbagamosi, 31, of No. 21, Kumoluyi Street, Oko-Oba, Agege, Lagos, was arraigned before Magistrate M. O. Osinbajo on 15 counts of conspiracy, forgery, obtaining by false pretense and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Francis Igbinosa alleged that the defendant and others at large conspired and committed the offence between 2017 and 2018 at Abeke Animaun Street, Lekki, Lagos. He said they obtained the N1,050,000 from Flymate Nigeria Ltd, represented by Mr Sunkanmi Ali, with a promise to procure admission for the prospective students at the University of Regina in Canada. The court heard that the company later discovered that the letters the students got were forgeries. Igbinosa said the defendant, on February 28, defrauded Chukwuemeka Idi, Raphael Offoelo, Michael Anaetoh, Onyekachi Isidore, Ojo Oladokun; Omoniyi Sowode and Akinpelu Akinwunmi. Others are: Monica Ezeh, Oladimeji Apanisil, Justin Nwadiaru, Kehinde Pani, John Obong, Chibuzor Onuegbu, Anayo Agu, Vitalis Agu  Mercy Akintunde  and Izuchukwu Axhodor, among others. The prosecutor said the offence contravened sections 287, 314, 366, 370 (b) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Gbadamosi pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Osinbajo granted him N30, 000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on January 10.
