There is no more winter sun for Anthony Joshua as he returned to the gym after a holiday with a challenge to his heavyweight rivals. Joshua has been sunning himself in Jamaica in recent weeks, but on Wednesday morning posted pictures to his Instagram page showing he was back in training. The British boxer accompanied pictures of him in weight training along with a message that he was going to knock out any contender for his world titles. Joshua posted a clip of him weightlifting, working his body and legs with huge dumbbells balanced across his shoulders. It was accompanied by a caption in lurid green writing: ‘Bigger and stronger! Knocking all top 10 fighters out one by one’. Joshua was working under the eyes of Nike trainer Jamie Reynolds, who also posted a black and white image of the world champion fighter in his weight lifting regime. It was a marked change of scene for Joshua from last week when his social media was filled with pictures of him living it up in the Caribbean. While away in Jamaica, the heavyweight champion showed a different side to his performing repertoire as he grabbed a microphone and put his singing to the test alongside reggae artist Beenie Man. Joshua’s next fight is set to be at Wembley Stadium on April 13 next year. Speculation persists that he will fight the winner of Tyson Fury against Deontay Wilder, who clash on December 1.
