Old students of the Federal Government College, Ogbomoso in Oyo State will come together on December 1, 2018 to mark their annual reunion. At a press conference organised by the Federal Government College of Ogbomoso Old Students Association (FEGOCOOSA) in Lagos, its Global President, Mrs Yetunde Jaiyesimi said the reunion would serve as opportunity to network, relive the good old days, honour those who have done well, provide help to the needy, and discuss how to help their alma mater. She said: “The association creates an avenue for us to continue what the unity the school has imbibed in us and also provide an opportunity to give back to the school that groomed us into what we are today. The annual reunion is the time for us to celebrate our school, teachers and give them awards because we would have been nothing today if not for them. We honour our best students and this year we would be honouring the best male and female students. We also give back to our non-teaching staff because they have also contributed in one way or the other,” she said. Mrs Jaiyesimi lamented the poor state of the college, which she attributed to negligence by the government. She noted that the old students had plans to rehabilitate the hostels, dining halls and sports complex. Chairman, End of the Year Committee, Mr Anthony Akarah, said the reunion would feature a talk on depression. “In the last 2-3 years, we have identified suicide and depression as a pain in the back of everyone, at this year’s reunion, we bring people to talk about depression issues, we are going to see what values we have in the country. The theme of the talk would be “Fostering Togetherness,” he said. Others in attendance were: Global Vice President, Mr Akinyemi Omoyeni, Global Treasurer; Mr Abidemi Oni, Welfare Officer; Vivian Mbagwu, Member end of year committee; Bimbo Salami, Member end of year committee; Segun Al Maroof, Global Financial Secretary; Joyce Omotosho and Social Secretary, Johnson Ogunbowale.
