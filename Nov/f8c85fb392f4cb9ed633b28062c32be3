Officials have told SCORENigeria that after a slow start ticket sales have picked up and at the last count, at least 17,000 tickets for tonight’s 2019 AFCON qualifier between home team South Africa and the Super Eagles. Local interest has also risen with fans confident the home team can get the win they need to qualify for next year’s AFCON. A confident Bafana Bafana fan told SCORENigeria: “We will beat Nigeria in the FNB Stadium here in Johannesburg. “The Super Eagles should prepare to go back to Nigeria without a point because we want to double the win against Nigeria after beating them in their country. Nigerians should just forget this match and think of how to beat Seychelles in the last match.” Kick-off is 2 pm local time, which is 3 pm Nigerian time.
