 If there was one player that gave super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr migraine in the draw match between Bafana Bafana and Super Eagles at the weekend, it was 24 year old Percy Tau. The German tactician made the confession while x-raying the match which saw Eagles qualify for the 2019 AFCON despite pulling a 1-1 draw. Rohr who is hoping to win the Nations Cup in Cameroon to justify his contract renewal just before the World cup in Russia, described Tau as a wonderful player capable of springing up surprises even as he expressed hope that Tau who is currently on loan with Belgian second division side Union SG will soon play his way into a bigger team in Europe. “I would also like to congratulate this wonderful player Percy Tau.” I hope to see him again in a big team in Europe. He has all the qualities to be a player in a big championship and he gave us a lot of problems. But collectively we were able to answer and to get the result we had to get,” he said in a chat with Supersports. Eagles’ last group match will be on the 22nd march 2019 against Seychelles, a tie which most soccer fans have dubbed mere formality. Seychelles can best be described as the weeping boy of the group conceding 17 goals in the last five matches and scoring just one against Libya who came close to spelling the country with goals, thanks to their 8-1 victory at the Weekend. The Mediterranean Knights have already become talking point following that result with most soccer fans betting that they will edge out South Africa from their current second position after the final match.
