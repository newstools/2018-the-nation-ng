The Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen said yesterday that efforts were ongoing to bring the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) under National Judicial Council (NJC) as an arm of the Judiciary. The CCT is currently an agency under the Presidency. CCT’s spokesman, Ibraheem Al-Hassan, in a statement, quoted Justice Onnoghen as saying that the move is intended  to enable the CCT function effectively and in accordance with the doctrine of separation of powers. The CJN spoke in Abuja at the Supreme Court complex, while administering oath of office on a new member of the CCT, Mrs. Julie Abieyuwa Amabor. He warned judges to avoid acts capable of rubbishing their name and that of the Judiciary. Justice Onnoghen urged the new CCT member to be above board in her decision and always abide by the judicial oath she took. He also admonished her to always be guided by the decisions of the appellate courts and learn to operate as a team player. The CJN urged the new CCT member to always be guided by her conscience, no matter whose ox is gored. Onnoghen said the delay in the appointment of a new member for the CCT was not that the NJC did not appreciate the important role the tribunal plays. He said the delay resulted from the resolve of the NJC to ensure that the right thing was done.
