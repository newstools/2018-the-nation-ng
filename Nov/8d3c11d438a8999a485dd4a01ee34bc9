 Ahead of their second match of the ongoing African Women Championship in Ghana, Super Falcons striker Asisat Oshoala has declared that the team will fight to the finish to earn resounding victory against Shepolopo of Zambia. The Dalian Quanjian of China forward apparently disappointed that Falcons failed to fly in the opener against Bayana Bayana even as he contributed in small measure to the dismal outing, described the forthcoming match as a make or break encounter, highlighting the make and break in capital letters. Taking to the social media the former Arsenal and Liverpool ladies ace said “It’s MAKE or BREAK day for us ” she declared Shepolopolo posted a tantalizing performance at the weekend defeating Equatorial Guinea 5-0. The Zambians were not only determined and fast on the ball but garnished effort with impressive finishing that attracted accolades from their fans. If Oshoala and her teammates are to achieve their dream of bouncing back, they will not only need to create chances but must learn to take the chances created. Already coach of the team Thomas Dernneby is already under fire with former Coach Godwin Izilien urging the NFF to show the Swede the door.
