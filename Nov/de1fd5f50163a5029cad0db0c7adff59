Nigerian international Alex Iwobi on Sunday put in another decent showing for Arsenal in what happened to be first match for the English Premier League club since he returned from a national assignment with his Super Eagles teammates. The 22-year-old was in action with brilliant game play for 82 minutes in the Arsenal’s 2-1 away win against AFC Bournemouth at Vitality Stadium in England on Sunday. After the 90 minute action packed three goals thriller, Arsenal successfully got back to winning ways to continue their 18-game unbeaten run at the Vitality Stadium. Bournemouth were looking to close the gap on the Gunners in the league, and started the brighter, but fell behind to an unfortunate own goal. Arsenal took the lead in extraordinary fashion, when Bournemouth’s Jefferson Lerma volleyed emphatically past his own keeper.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang then got the Gunners back in front in the second half, prodding home Sead Kolasinac’s cross from close range. Recall that the the Nigerian Arsenal attacking midfielder was in the last two national assignments; one of which saw the Super Eagles qualified for 2019 Africa Cup of Nation despite playing a 1-1 draw against Bafana Bafana last weekend at the FNB Stadium in Johannesburg. Despite that some key players were rested two days after Eagles picked the AFCON ticket Eagles German handler Gernor Rohr still fielded Iwobi in an international friendly match against Uganda at the Stephen Keshi Stadium in Asaba; though he was substituted in the second half. Rohr has since confirmed that the youngster is pivotal to his campaign at the 2019 AFCON tournament in Cameroon and would only wish Iwobi will remain fit and see more playing time to put him in shape for the forthcoming tourney.
