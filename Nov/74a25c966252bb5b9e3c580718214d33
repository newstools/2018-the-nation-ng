The Ministry of Labour and Employment has requested for more funds and improved budgetary allocation to fund its programmes and activities, which are very vital to economic development and growth of the country. The ministry made the request as the Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Prof. Stephen Ocheni, declared that the Federal Government was poised to get many youths out of unemployment. Ocheni, who spoke during an oversight visit of the House of Representatives Committee on Labour, Employment and Productivity to the ministry, said the ministry required additional funds to carry out its activities and programmes. He said the ministry’s activities were necessary for efficient economic growth of the country as they affect the most important factors of production, which are human resources. He added that the ministry needed to play greater roles in the development of skills for the teeming workforce. Ocheni pointed out that to effectively carry out its mandate, the ministry requires improved funding of its programmes and activities through improved budgetary appropriation. “I would like to use this opportunity to advocate for improved budgetary allocation when the time comes. The main focus of this ministry in line with the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (GRGP) of the present administration was to get as many people as possible out of unemployment. We are also focused on creating a conducive environment for the promotion of enterprise and decent work for citizens, while maintaining harmonious working relationship between the workers, unions and employers in workplaces nationwide,” he said.   In his address, the Chairman, House Committee on Labour, Employment and Productivity, Hon. Francis Ezenwa, stated that the committee was in the ministry for oversight visit and to see what the ministry has done so far on appropriation, and the progress made on its mandate.
