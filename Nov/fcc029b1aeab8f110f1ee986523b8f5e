Nigeria’s golf teenage sensation – Georgia Oboh started her professional career on a positive note as the 17-year-old claimed her first pro title at the 2018 Cote d’Ivoire Open concluded on Sunday in Abidjan. The tournament held at the 6669 yards par 73 Ivoire Golf Club course became the start of a successful pro career for the 2018 Youth Olympian. To emerge winner, Georgia Oboh finished the tournament with scores of 74/78/85/78 and won the tournament by 3 shots ahead of Senegal’s Oumy Dieye and Madagascar’s Leslie Grandet of the Sunshine Ladies tour and a host of lady professionals from Côte d’Ivoire. From day one, Oboh led the tournament with on opening round of 74 and subsequently led the tournament by 7. However she had a tough hurdle on day three and four, where she found her 7 shot lead cut to 3 by the tough Senegal’s Oumy Dieye, who is a seasoned professional based in Morocco. On day three the pressure built up and Oboh saw her previous day two lead of 5 completely depleted in the first 6 holes for the battle to begin. But Oboh had to dig deep and by the end of day three, she had taken control of the tournament once more and led by 3 shots again to separate herself from the field. There was yet another drama as the third round was only completed on day four due to failing light on day three. Oboh and the Senegalese had to come in early on Sunday morning just to play the last hole then wait until noon to start the fourth and final round. The fourth round was eventful with Oboh’s birdie finish on the 18th hole to a great gallery of spectators who came out in their numbers to herald in the new queen of the greens. With this win, Oboh has become the youngest winner of a professional event in Africa. The next stop for the Edo State-born golfer is the final stage of the Ladies European Tour (LET) School final in Marrakech from December 16 to 20 in Morocco.
