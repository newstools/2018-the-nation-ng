Delta Government on Monday assured the corp members that it placed high priority on their welfare and security. GovernorÂ  Ifeanyi Okowa made the assertion during the swearing-in of the Batch C Stream II corps members in Issele-Uku. Okowa, represented by the Commissioner for Higher Education, Mr Jude Sinebe, said that adequate security arrangements were on ground in the nooks and crannies of the state. He said that this was put in place to enable them go about their their lawful duties and that they should only recognise and respect the cultures and traditions of their host communities. Okowa said that one of the national assignments they were expected to undertake was the 2019 general elections. He noted the NYSC over the years made a name for itself through its contribution to the successful conduct of elections in the country. He said joining in the scheme would afford them the opportunity to be part of the success stories recorded. Earlier, the state NYSC Cordinator, Mr Benjamin Omotade, said that 1,430 corps members comprising 780 females and 650 males were duly registered. Omotade reminded them that the task of building a united, prosperous and strong egalitarian society as they swore to uphold required commitment and hard work. He therefore, called on the corps members to roll-up their sleeves and get to work. He advised them to keep wholly to all the instructions and training that they would be given on camp. NAN
