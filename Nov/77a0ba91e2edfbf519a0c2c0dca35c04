Former Managing Director of FilmOne Limited and now Chief Executive Officer of KomWorld, Nigeria, Kene Mkparu, was in Istanbul, Turkey to attend the 2018 Emerging Cinema Market Conference as a key speaker. Mkparu, a respected voice in the cinema exhibition and distribution aspect of the film industry, joined other leading cinema exhibitors, technology companies and industry experts to explore innovations, opportunities and challenges for cinema development in Emerging Cinema Market (ECM). Organised by DCS Events in association with The Big Picture and SISAY Turkish Exhibitors Association, the ECM is without a doubt crucial to the development of the new opportunities across Africa, Central Asia, the Balkans, Eastern Europe and Turkey. Ahead of the event, Mkparu said he looked forward to a very informative and interesting event that would also offer a unique chance to network with industry experts and professionals as well a unique chance to share the story and potentials of the biggest cinema market in the continent of Africa. “It is going to be the gathering of who’s is who in cinema business and so I am one for any opportunity to tell our success story as an industry and also to share ideas and experience on how we can grow and become truly global best practice operators,” Mkparu said shortly before he jetted out to Turkey for the conference. “So I am excited about this conference particularly that there will be a highlight on Africa and Turkey. I am also excited about the huge attention it will direct to Nigeria.” Other speakers at the conference which hosted trade show were Paul Higginson, Executive Vice President – EMEA, 20th Century Fox, Till Cussmann, Senior Vice President Sales & GM Europe, Vista, Arturo Guillen, Vice President, EMEA & India, ComScore, Mariam el Bacha, Chief Executive Officer, Cinepax, Pakistan and Jordi Wientjes, Consultant The Big Picture & Founder, Jordi Wientjes Solutions B.V.
