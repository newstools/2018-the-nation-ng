The General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Pastor Enoch Adeboye has challenged Nigerians to imbibe the values of love, contentment and peaceful co-existence to foster national development. Adeboye stated this last week at the special thanksgiving and prayer for tenants, landlord, estate developers, orphans, widows, jobless and their families at RCCG Headquarters, Throne of Grace Parish, Ebute-Metta, Lagos. The service tagged divine visitation attracted thousands of Christians with traditional rulers and public servants in attendance. He lamented many Nigerians were not abiding by the scriptural injunction to be contented once food and clothing had been taken care of. Adeboye pointed out covetousness has taken over the lives of many people who lust to have everything to themselves as if they can ride two cars or where two clothes at the same time. Speaking through The Assistant General Overseer of RCCG on Administration and Personnel, Pastor Johnson Odesola, Adeboye blamed covetousness on inordinate ambition and desire to have everything, including those things that are not needed or would not add significant value to one’s life. He also described “security” as a factor that guarantees peace, joy and contentment, noting that true security, of course, comes from God only. According to him: “Man completely believing in himself to provide full security for his family would end up as a failure because no matter how strong a man is, he would fall asleep but there is only one person who neither sleeps nor slumber, but ever awake to protect those who have absolute trust in Him”. He posited further that a house becomes a home where all these factors of contentment, peace, security and joy are prevalent.
