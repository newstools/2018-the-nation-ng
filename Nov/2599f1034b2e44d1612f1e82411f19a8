Super Eagles technical adviser Gernot Rohr has stated that he did his best to ensure that Chelsea winger Victor Moses did not quit the national team after Nigeria’s poor outing at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia but his efforts ended in futility. Victor Moses on August 15, 2018 called time on his Super Eagles career with reasons of focusing on his club, career and his young family as well as allowing the next generation of Super Eagles stars step up and florish in their various positions. Gernot Rohr replying questions from football lovers across the world at the Peak Breakfast with Rohr organised for Sport editors in Lagos said: “I tried to convince him that it was not the best time to retire but he said he wanted to focus on his club career. I hope he will get an opportunity to play in Chelsea or with another club. The Franco-German tactician also stated that the door is not closed to the versatile player. “I hope he will change his mind because he is only 27-years-old. That is too young to retire.” Victor Moses, who helped Nigeria win her first Africa Cup of Nations trophy in 2013 after 19 years and also featured at the 2014 and 2018 World Cups, has had a difficult time at Chelsea since the arrival of Maurizio Sarri playing just twice in the ongoing English Premier League.
