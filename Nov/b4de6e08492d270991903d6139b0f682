Two jobless men were on Monday brought before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly stealing underground cables in the community where they reside. The accused, Michael Emmanuel, 18, and Daniel Lawal, 22, who reside at Iberekodo community in Ibeju-Lekki, near Lagos are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy to commit felony and stealing. The duo, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Prosecutor, Sgt. Modupe Olaluwoye, told the court that the two men committed the offences on Aug. 18 at about 4.00 a.m. at Iberekodo community. Olaluwoye said the duo had broken into the community’s power station and dug out underground amoured cables. She said that a resident of the community that saw them dragging a bag containing the cable out of the station reported the incident to the head of the community. The prosecutor told the court that the police were yet to determine the value of the cables. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs Oluwatoyin Oghere, granted each of the accused bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two sureties each in like sum. Oghere said that the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction and must be gainfully employed. She also ordered that the sureties should show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State government. The case was adjourned until Jan. 30, 2019 for hearing.
