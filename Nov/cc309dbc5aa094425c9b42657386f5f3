A Kabong Upper Area Court in Jos on Monday sentenced a 21-year-old tailor, Emmanuel Yakubu, to one year imprisonment for stealing a woman’s hand bag. The Judge, Nanlang Dashe, who did not give Yakubu a fine option, also ordered him to pay N39,700 to the owner of the bag. Earlier, the prosecutor, Ezekiel Galadima, had told the court that the case was reported at the Police Area Command Office, Jos on Nov. 17, 2018, by Ishaya Joshua, a Police officer and leader of a Police patrol team. Galadima told the court that the accused, who is a resident of Jenta-Mangoro in Jos, was arrested while in possession of a hand bag belonging to one Naomi Sunday. The prosecutor alleged that the accused person conspired with two others, now at large, to snatch the hand bag. “The bag contained a cell phone valued at N38,000 and N1,700 cash, but as at the time of recovery, it was empty,” Galadima further stated. He said that the offence was contrary to sections 97 and 287 of the penal code law. On arraignment, the accused pleaded guilty as charged, and begged the court for leniency. NAN
