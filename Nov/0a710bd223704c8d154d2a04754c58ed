The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Edo State has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sign the amended Electoral Act into law. Its Chairman, Chief Dan Orbih, addressed reporters in Okada after he received a honorary doctorate degree in Political Science from the Igbinedion University, Okada. Orbih said the President should sign the bill to give the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) time to meet the specific provisions of the law. The party chair wondered how issues about the card reader would be resolved should the President not sign the bill. He decried the huge number of uncollected Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). “These are not good signs for the elections. I am disturbed by the silence of Nigerians over the continued delay by President Buhari in signing the Electoral Act, as amended and passed by the National Assembly. The issue is which law would INEC recourse to in conducting the election.”
