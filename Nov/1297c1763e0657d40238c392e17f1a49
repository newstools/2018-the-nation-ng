The Super Eagles of Nigeria will participate in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. They booked their place in the continent’s biggest football competition after securing a 1-1 draw against South Africa at the FNB Stadium, Johannesburg. Nigeria had missed out of the last two editions, after winning the title in 2013, in the FNB Stadium. The Nigerians had highest goal scorer, Odion Ighalo and first choice goalkeeper, Francis Uzoho  missing on the trip to the Soccer City due to injury. The Sper Eagles started the stronger side with a nice combination on the dge of the South Africa box and Ahmed Musa forced goalkeeper Itumeleng  Khune into a good save with a low shot. Two minutes later, Buhle Mkhwanazi scored an own goal for the Super Eagles, converting a cross from Samuel Kalu into his own net Lebo Mothiba responded with a goal for the Bafana Bafana in the 26th minute,  scored for the Bafana Bafana after a good pass for Percy Tau that beat two Nigerian defenders In the 71st minute  Percy Tau, who won the man of the match afterwards, troubled the Nigerian defence, dribbling past two defenders, but Jamilu Collins intercepted his attempt to score a second for South Africa. Isaac Success later on scored a goal for Nigeria, but the bulky forward was ruled offside after the hosts’ defence was exposed. With Nigeria through to the continental showpiece next year, the winner between South Africa and Libya will join the Super Eagles for the June/July 24-Nations competition in Cameroon. A draw however will be good enough for South Africa, who were last in the Nations Cup in 2015.
