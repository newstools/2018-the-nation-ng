THE Independent Corruption Practices and other related offences Commission (ICPC) yesterday re-arraigned a former Inspector-General of Police, Sunday Ehindero and ex- Commissioner of Police, John Obaniyi, before a Federal Capital Territory (FCT) High Court, Apo on a 10-count charge for alleged N16.4 million fraud. The charge borders on conspiracy, fraud and making false statement. The former police chiefs, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. Prosecution counsel Mr. O.G. Iwuagwu told the court that the accused committed the offences from May 2006 to November 2006. Iwuagwu said the duo conspired and used their positions to place N500 million in two fixed deposit accounts. He added that the money was part of N557,995,065.00 donated by the Bayelsa Government to the Police for purchase of arms and ammunition. The prosecutor, however, added that the N500 million placed in fixed deposits yielded an interest of N16,412,315.06. According to him, the alleged offences contravene Sections 26(1) and 22(5) of the ICPC Act, 2000. Counsel to the defendant Mr. Messrs Kenneth Onorun and Mr. Samuel Obairko prayed the court to uphold the bail granted to them when they were first arraigned. They objected to the prosecutorâ€™s application for the court to proceed with evidence by a prosecution witness who, the prosecutor said, was ready to testify. The defence counsel submitted that the statements of the accused were not served along with the amended charge. Justice Sylvanus Orji directed the prosecutor to serve the defence counsel with the statements. Justice Orji adjourned the case until January 8 for hearing.
