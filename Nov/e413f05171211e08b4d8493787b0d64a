The Lagos State University (LASU) has begun issuing backlog of certificates to its graduates. Over 100 graduates showed up Monday to collect their certificates at the university’s main auditorium where the certificate unit of the Registry has set up shop until January 1, 2019. The Principal Assistant Registrar/Head, Certificate Unit, Mr Olabode Akinrimade, said in a statement by the university’s centre for information, press and public relations (CIPPR) that 32,522 certificates were ready for collection by those who could prove they had attended the university. Even if they cannot present the requisite document, Akinrimade said the university had measures to help identify the graduates. He debunked claims that the university was withholding the certificates. “Over 100 graduates turned up on the first day of the first day of the certificates release/collection exercise.  It is very untrue that LASU is not releasing certificates,” he said. The university’s Registrar, Olayinka Amuni, monitored the exercise on Monday.
