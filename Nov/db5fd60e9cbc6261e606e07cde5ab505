The police Lagos have arrested a man Peter Adida for alleged defilement of his two-year-old daughter. Adida, a resident of 9, Oyetayo Olafisoye Street, Westwood Estate in Badore, Ajah, was arrested on November 17 by Langbasa Divisional Police Officer (DPO) Ada Okafor, a Superintendent (SP). It was gathered that preliminary investigations revealed the baby was penetrated and was infected with a Sexually Transmitted Disease (STI). According to the police, the victim pointed at her father when she was asked by a female officer who did it to her. “She was able to describe various sex positions with dad,” said spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP). He said Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal has directed that the matter be transferred to Gender Unit for investigation. “He admonishes parents and guardians to watch their children closely as predators are on the increase,” said Oti.
