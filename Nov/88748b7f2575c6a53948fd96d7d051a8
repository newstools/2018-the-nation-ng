The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday quizzed a former Governor of Abia State, Chief Theodore Orji over alleged N27billion fraud. It was unclear yesterday if Orji, who was still being investigated as at press time, will be released or not. According to a source, the ex-governor was invited by the anti-graft agency, following a petition. Orji, dressed in milk-colour Niger Delta long sleeve attire, came with a lawyer for the interrogation. The allegations against the ex-governor are: diversion of funds allocated by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for Small and Medium Scale; misuse of ASOPADEC funds; diversion of Ecological Fund; and acquisition of properties with ill-gotten money in Port Harcourt, Abuja and Abia State. The source said: “Following a petition, the discreet investigation of the former governor started in 2015. But it is now time to respond to issues in the petition. “The office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), commercial banks and other relevant agencies have been invited and have given reasonable information. “Our operatives have been questioning the ex-governor in the last seven hours. It is too early to conclude on whether or not he will be granted bail. So far, he is still in EFCC custody The agency’s Acting Head of Media & Publicity, Tony Orilade, confirmed the development yesterday. He said: “Yes. It is true that we have the former Abia governor with us. But I cannot say more than that.  When it is time to press charges, we shall do that and the story would be in the media.” The Abia Progressives Forum (APF) had in April urged the EFCC to probe the ex-governor and members of his family. Its Chairman Mazi Okechukwu said the anti-graft agency should look into the activities of Orji during his eight-year tenure.
