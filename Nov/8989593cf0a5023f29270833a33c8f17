Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has said a strong procurement management in the public sector is a tool for achieving political, economic and social goals. He added that a productive public procurement policy will enhance people’s welfare. Speaking yesterday at a workshop organised by the Ministry of Establishment, Training and Pensions, in conjunction with Midas Partners, in Ikeja, to train procurement officials in the civil service in drafting sustainable procurement policies, Ambode reiterated his administration’s commitment to training procurement officers to get value for money in a competitive world and in a depressed economy. The governor, represented by Establishment, Training and Pensions Commissioner Dr. Akintola Benson-Oke, stressed the need for sustainable procurement policies in the face of a depressed economy. He said the workshop was organised to emphasise the need for the state public service to reconcile two irreconcilable purposes “to keep pursuing quality in procurement decisions and to control the cost in the face of economic challenges.” The facilitator, who is the Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos, Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, hailed the government for organising the training. He said it could be used to support the economy and transform supply-chain business models. Permanent Secretary Ministry of Establishment, Training and Pensions    Mrs. Rhoda Ayinde said the government was passionate about its workforce, “hence the approval of this training and the previous ones.” She urged the participants to reciprocate the gesture by working hard for the progress of Lagos State.
