Prof. Olanrewaju Fagbohun, Vice-Chancellor, Lagos State University (LASU), has identified alumni associations as major stakeholders in the development of their alma mater, as members carry certificates of their institutions for life. Fagbohun, in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria, (NAN) on Friday in Lagos, charged the LASU alumni association to be proactive and not allow anyone use the institution as a bedlam of crisis. “The moment for the LASU alumni to work is now. Lanre Fagbohun will go, others will go, but if you (alumni) are not working, there will be trouble. “The alumni must be proactive now and stop sleeping. They must not allow anyone to use LASU as a bedlam of crisis, “he said According to him, this is key because the university is at a stage where it competes with the very best around the globe because it is aiming at being the best. Fagbohun said the competition between the institution and others earned it selection by the World Bank as an Africa Centre of Excellence recently. “An Africa Centre of Excellence does not permit for strikes or crises because we will be attracting foreign students, so we must be proactive and strategic. “LASU as an African Centre of Excellence is now viewed as a philosopher and is expected to think of the gap in the system and how to solve it,” he said. According to the Vice-Chancellor, the university is also hopeful of being selected in some other bids it put in for international centres. Fagbohun appealed to the university’s alumni association not to desecrate the institution or allow anyone do so. He said this was important so that LASU would not go back to its dark ages when it was synonymous with crisis. “Benefactors will run away from LASU if we go back to the dark ages, as no one will invest in a place where there is crisis, “he said.
