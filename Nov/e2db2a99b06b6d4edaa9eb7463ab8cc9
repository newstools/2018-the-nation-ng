First Bank Basketball Club will take on INSS of Congo on Wednesday in a game that will decide the team that tops the Group B at the FIBA Africa Women Champions Cup in Maputo, Mozambique. Both teams have won three games and finishing tops will give the group winner a favourable draw in the quarter final as it will take on the fourth placed team in Group A. However, First Bank who is the seeded team in this group, is expected to prevail over the rivals from Congo. When both sides met in 2015 in Angola, the Nigerian team defeated the Congolese and revenge would be on the minds of the INSS players. The Nigerian team, despite still struggling to play as a unit after six players joined the team in Maputo, the new arrivals are expected to propel the team to victory. Coach Peter Ahmedu is aware that toping the group is a task to be accomplished said that everything will be done to realise their ambition. “Like I always say no team is a push over in any championship. It is good we are in position to top the group, but we will have to complete the job on Wednesday by beating INSS. It means that the game is a very important and we will take it seriously. “I respect our opponents, but we are both here for one purpose and that is to win the championship. so as soon as the game begins, I must steer my team to victory and forget every other thing. I know revenge will be on their minds, but this is definitely not the time to accomplish that. We are here to win,” Ahmedu added. INSS Cecile Mukoso Nyoka who was in the 2015 squad beaten by First Bank, said that her team would everything possible to win Wednesday’s game. “I know First Bank is a good team, but they can be beaten. They have beaten us before and winning tomorrow’s game will be a good one for use. We hve good players in my team and that should help emerge victorious,” Nyoka added.
