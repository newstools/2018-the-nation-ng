 Hosts Ghana Friday crashed out of the ongoing African Women Nations cup after playing out a 1-1 draw against Cameroon. The Black Queens who shot into the lead in the early stage of the encounter thanks to Portia Boakye   looked good to run away with the much needed victory to earn them a place in the semifinals, but that was not to be after Cameroon converted a penalty handed to opponents on a platter by Black Queens goalkeeper which was quickly delivered by Christine Manie. The draw was enough for Cameroon to qualify for the semifinals with seven points  but Ghana’s exit was further confirmed when Mali came from behind in the second group match to edge out Algeria 3-2 in Cape Coast. Super Falcons who bounced back into contention after beating Zambia 4-0 will on Saturday take on already eliminated Equatorial Guinea in the last group match while Group leaders South Africa take on Zambia. The championship is not only aimed at determining the reigning women’s champion in the  continent but also determine the teams that will represent the continent at the 2019 Women’s world cup in France. The exit means Ghana will not have the opportunity to  represent Africa at next year’s Women’s World Cup in France with the top three finishers expected to fly the continent’s flag.
