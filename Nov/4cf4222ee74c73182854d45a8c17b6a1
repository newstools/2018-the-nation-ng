RIVERS State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has raised the alarm that the Federal Government has concluded plans to plant 800 guns in the state, with the objective of destabilising the state. In a statement signed by Special Assistant to the state governor on Electronic Media, Simeon Nwakaudu, the governor was quoted as saying that the Federal Government resolved to implement the plot during her last security meeting. He stated that the intelligence came from credible sources that were privy to the plot against the state. The governor called on the international community “to take note of the proposed illegal action of the APC Federal Government, which is aimed at creating crisis in the state.” He regretted that the Federal Government has continued to work deliberately to compromise the security of the state. “Wike urged the people of the state to remain calm, but vigilant,” he said, adding “that the evil machinations of the Federal Government will not distract the state from delivering on her constitutional responsibilities to Rivers people.” Reacting, the Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed has dismissed the allegation, describing it as a distraction and a figment of his (Wike’s)imagination. The minister also posited that the governor may the making the allegation knowing that he was going to be voted out in the coming 2019 general election. “This is a figment of Governor Wike’s imagination and a distraction. I guess the governor is already afraid that he will lose the next election. The Federal Government has no business planting guns anywhere. Perhaps the governor himself plans to plant the guns,” the minister said.
