•Daniel leads Atiku support groups to visit Yoruba war generalissimo Former Ogun State Governor and Director-General of Atiku Campaign Organisation Gbenga Daniel yesterday led over 20 members of the Atiku campaign groups to visit the the Aare Onakakanfo of Yoruba Land, Gani Adams. Daniels said his visit was to pay a courtesy visit to Adams as the 15th Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland and to seek support for Atiku Abubakar’s presidential ambition. Adams thanked Daniel for the visit, describing him as one of the prominent sons of Yoruba that has the interest of Yoruba at heart. He added that he will only support a presidential candidate that has passion and believes in the restructuring of Nigeria. The Aare noted that the only solution to Nigeria’s present problems is the restructuring, saying Nigeria should be restructured along the six geo-olitical zones based on federating units. “This is how it was written in the 1963 constitution; this will give room for the economy and developmental rivalries among the six zones based on federating units. Any political party that believes in this will have our support, he said. Some of the dignitaries in the entourage include Araba Tola Adeniyi, Akogun Tunde Odanye, Chief Kole Omololu, Mr. Hakeem Gbajabiamila, Mr. Seyi Wellington, Prof Kila of University of Cambridge, among others.
