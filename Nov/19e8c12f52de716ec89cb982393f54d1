The contracts of the projects are ongoing. The second Niger Bridge is on course. The Enugu – Port Harcourt Expressway and many other roads and projects are on course, the Vice President stressed. He changed the people to embrace the change mantra being enunciated by the APC by ensuring that they voted for the in the coming elections. The standard bearer of the APC in Enugu State, Senator Ayogu Eze who was visibly elated at the presence of the Vice President assured that the party would wrest power from the ruling party in the state, the PDP. He dismissed the said endorsement of Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi by some Igbo leaders saying that the Igbo never at any time met and discussed it. “The said endorsement was a fraud. The Igbos never met to take such decision,” he said.
