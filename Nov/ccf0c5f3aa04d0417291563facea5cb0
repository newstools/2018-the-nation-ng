In the spirit of the international children day, an event that occurs every 20th November, it is important to note that children are no longer leaders of tomorrow, but leaders of today With the 2018 theme “Children are taking over and turning the world blue” , the United Nations encourage that children on this day “take over” key roles in media, politics, business, sport and entertainment to voice their support for millions of their peers who are unschooled, unprotected and uprooted. The Children of today look forward to a great and awesome future that they have not gotten.  Despite their hard work to achieve greatness, the society is left with a generation that has little or nothing to show for their hard work All that occurs today are excuses and complains about the government, physical barriers, financial problems and societal limitations. It is important as leaders and parents to help bring out the giant in children through education, training, giving them responsibilities and others. Let there be no more excuses and regrets because all opportunities for a better life is open.
As the cases of violence against children is becoming  rampant and the society, with unending defilement and brutal murder of children, our hearts bleed for victims as the society needs to take a stand to fight for the children.
Silence will make no difference and indifference itself will make us eternal slaves to the unjust.  Olusegun Esther is a student of Kwara State Polytechnic.
