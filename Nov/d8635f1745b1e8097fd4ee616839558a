In the quest towards ensuring a cleaner, germ-free environment, Hypo, a brand in the bleach and inexpensive disinfectant market, has commemorated this year’s World Toilet Day with the unveiling of a new variant – Hypo Toilet Cleaner – to cater to  various economic social class. The event was graced by representatives from the Lagos State Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, Nigerian Medical Association (NMA), and celebrities from the movie industry. They  promised to enlighten the public on the need to keep the environment safe for the greater good of all. This year’s theme for the World Toilet Day, tagged “When nature calls,” was borne out of the need to proffer solutions to the global sanitation needs as it has been recognised that over 62.5 percent of people over the world do not have access to safe sanitation when it comes to answering nature’s call. Mrs. Wale Poluyi, Director (Pharmacy), Lagos State Drug Quality Control Laboratory, who represented the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health, called for the need for Nigerians to understand that human waste, if not properly disposed, is capable of spreading germs. She urged people on the need to stay hygienic with toilets and environment. According to the Brand Manager of Hypo, Onome Asagbra, who made a presentation before the unveiling, “Nigeria has also been ranked among top three countries in the world for the number of people without toilets, according to a WaterAid’s State of the World’s Toilet report. It also states that fewer than three in 10 people have a decent toilet, which clearly shows there is a problem, which must be tackled”.
