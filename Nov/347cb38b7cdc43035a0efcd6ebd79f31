Queen of Afrohouse Niniola over the weekend in Lagos thrilled attendees at the Human Radio Concert which held at the Landmark Event Center, Lagos. With Shody The Turn Up King and Larry Foreman as hosts, the concert kicked off with DJ Crowd Kontroller and DJ DIPS warming up the crowd with a mix of old and new school hits. The opening acts were an interesting mix of voices in the industry such as Tyson Noir, Immaculate, Ric Hassani, Okiemute, GreyC, and heavy weights like Slimcase, L.A.X and Reminisce. Some highlights of the opening segment of the evening were Teni the Entertainer doing a freestyle, Aramide playing the guitar and singing a new song for the audience, Godwin Strings’ brilliant violin renditions of popular songs, and Reminisce dancing on stage with Shody the Turn Up King. With the crowd sufficiently hyped, talking drums and a short play by her dancers welcomed Niniola who serenaded the audience with some of her love songs such as ’Oyin’, ’Moyo’, and ’Akara Oyibo’. She then eased into a fans favorite ’Start All Over’, the soulful duet featuring Johnny Drille. Following that, the audience was treated to a dance break that paid homage to Nigeria’s famous dance crazes. Niniola returned to the stage ready to turn up with ‘Jigi Jigi’, cuing a few of her dance hits such as ‘Soke’, and ‘Shaba’, and a surprise appearance by Terry Apala who joined her in performing ‘Bale.’ For the finale, Niniola thrilled the audience with a Yoruba ceremony style performance, complete with talking drums, improvised lyrics, and traditional dances from Ekiti as she performed ‘Gbowode.’ She followed this with ‘Saro’, ‘Maradona’, and ‘Bana’, inviting fans from the audience to join her on stage.
