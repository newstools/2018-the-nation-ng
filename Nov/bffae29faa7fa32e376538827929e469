Super Eagles’ midfielder, Oghenekaro Etebo has weighed in on one of the biggest football arguments of the decade which is giving his opinion on whom he thinks is the better player between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. Speaking with footballlive.ng the Stoke City midfielder who was on loan to Spanish side Las Palmas last season said. “They are both top players but I must tell you the truth, you can imagine that in 10 years it’s been both of them staying consistent for that long. I don’t think it has ever happened before in football. These two rivals are so good and untouchable but I’m going to go for Lionel Messi as the better of the two.” Etebo, last season in the La Liga had a standout performance against Lionel Messi’s Barcelona matching the Argentine toe-to-toe in the fixture and also stepping up to the five-time World Footballer of the Year at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Brazil in the colours of Nigeria where the Super Eagles fell 2-1 to the south American nation. Although Etebo has never played against Cristiano Ronaldo he still has some very kind words for the former Real Madrid legend. “Ronaldo is a very hardworking player that shows you that with dedication to what you do you can reach the top of your craft. I honestly admire him as well but Messi is just magical.” Etebo moved away from the La Liga to Stoke City in England after the Spanish team relegated from the top flight.
