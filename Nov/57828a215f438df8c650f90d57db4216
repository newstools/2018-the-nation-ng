All is set for the Hallmark University, Ijebu Itele, Ogun State, to hold its 2018 pageant which will produce Mr. and Miss Hallmark University. The event will hold at the school’s auditorium. Speaking to The Nation, a supporting lecturer of the university, Uchenna Benneth, said registered students of Hallmark University that are good looking are qualified to take part in the competition. He said: “The winner will get a laptop, while the first and second runner up will get a phone. One of the aims of the programme is to encourage the students to socialise. Mr. Hallmark University and Miss Hallmark University will become the school’s ambassadors and they are expected to present the school in good light.”
