A consultant psychiatrist, Dr. Tomi Imarah, has identified the cultural tendency to keep sexual assaults and rape cases secret, as some of the major issues hindering the fight against sex crime. Imarah, who runs an online Mental Health Counselling Service, “Dr. Tomi’s Haven”, via her Facebook page, @drtomihaven, spoke yesterday during an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. She spoke about the commemoration of the 2018 International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women marked yearly on November 25. Wikipaedia, an online publication, says: “The United Nations General Assembly has designated November 25 as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women (Resolution 54/134). “The premise of the day is to raise awareness of the fact that women around the world are subject to rape, domestic violence and other forms of violence. “One of the aims of the day is to highlight that the scale and true nature of the issue is often hidden.” According to Imarah, statistics have shown that almost two third of the perpetrators of rape are acquaintances, with one third of these figures being family members. “It is disheartening that girls and young women can identify their assailants; yet, these people walk around free.”
