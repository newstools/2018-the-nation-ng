A health   and   fitness   expert,   Dr.   Bisi   Abiola,   has   recommended   100   per cent   fruit   juice   for professionals   who   are   denied   the   opportunity   of   regular   breakfast   as   a   result   of   tight   job schedules. Abiola also noted that adding fruit juice to the breakfast table gives individuals who are often too busy to eat regularly the needed nourishment to start off their daily activities. She made this observation during the November edition of her monthly discourse on the health benefits of 100 per cent fruit juice, a platform aimed at promoting the No-Added Sugar initiative of Chi Ltd. Abiola noted: “The consequence of our modern lifestyle has forced many people to resort tounhealthy lifestyle and feeding habits, which are now frequently linked to the development of an increasing number of diseases like   osteoporosis, high blood pressure, high   cholesterol, respiratory infection, obesity,   asthma, cancer, cardiovascular disease,   diabetes, stroke and thyroid. “In most homes, both parents have jobs, whether working for someone else or self-employed, leaving little or no time to cook. So, the norm is grab-on-the-go meal or going without breakfast. One of the things that come handy in this situation is 100 per cent fruit juice.” According to the expert, individuals who adopt unhealthy food habits often skip breakfast, eat little fruit and vegetables or stick to one meal a day. A healthy attitude towards fruit juice, shestated, is a convenient way to prevent health challenges associated with busy lifestyles. “An intake of food balanced with essential nutrients, which include 100 per cent fruit juice, will help improve our immunity level and keep us healthy,” she noted. Abiola, who is also the chief executive of Indulge Nigeria Limited, said pure fruit juice could also be taken as a source for energy during prolonged meetings and intensive fitness sessions.
