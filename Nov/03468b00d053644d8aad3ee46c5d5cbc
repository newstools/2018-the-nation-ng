A travel consultant, Babatunde Gbadamosi, was yesterday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court for allegedly obtaining N1,050,000 from 22 students and issuing them forged Canadian Universities’ admission letters. Gbagamosi, 31, of 21, Kumoluyi Street, Oko-Oba, Agege, Lagos, was arraigned before Magistrate M. O. Osinbajo on 15 counts of conspiracy, forgery, obtaining by false pretence and stealing. Prosecuting Inspector Francis Igbinosa alleged that the defendant and others at large committed the offence between 2017 and 2018 at Abeke Animashaun Street, Lekki, Lagos. He said they obtained N1,050,000 from Flymate Nigeria Ltd, represented by Mr. Sunkanmi Ali, with a promise to procure admission for the prospective students at the University of Regina in Canada. The court heard that the company later discovered that the letters were forged. Igbinosa said the defendant, on February 28, defrauded Chukwuemeka Idi, Raphael Offoelo, Michael Anaetoh, Onyekachi Isidore, Ojo Oladokun, Omoniyi Sowode and Akinpelu Akinwunmi, Monica Ezeh, Oladimeji Apanisil, Justin Nwadiaru, Kehinde Pani, John Obong, Chibuzor Onuegbu, Anayo Agu, Vitalis Agu Mercy Akintunde and Izuchukwu Axhodor, among others.

Magistrate Osinbajo granted him N30, 000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on January 10.
