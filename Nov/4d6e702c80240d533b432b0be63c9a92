Super Eagles’ forward, Isaac Success has vowed to continue improving his game for Watford to ensure he keeps his place in the team despite getting regular playing time in recent weeks for the Hornets, AOIFootball.com reports. The former Granada youth prodigy, who featured for the Eagles against South Africa and Uganda, told AOIFootball.com exclusively in Asaba that he has put all setbacks behind him and wants to focus on doing well for the club this season. “After the setback two years ago, I think I have put in more concentration into my game and that has helped me a lot. I believe I waited for my time at Watford for a while and now I’m having my chance with the team and I’m glad about it. “So, I just have to keep working hard to maintain that position in the team because we have a lot of good strikers who are always ready to play so that is another big challenge for me,” Success said. Having started four of his side’s five league outings, the 22-year-old however believes it will even motivate him more as he hopes to do well as the season unfolds. “It’s always good when the manager trusts you to start, so I just have to keep working hard and make sure I make a lot of impact when given the chance to play and help the team achieve its objectives,” Success said. The Eagles forward has scored three goals in all competitions this season and has been getting regular playing time under new manager Javi Garcia, with his form earning him a recall to the national team.
