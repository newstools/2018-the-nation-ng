About 50 secondary school pupils from Abuja have undertaken a cultural tour of Lagos to explore its artistic peculiarities. The Abuja International Community School pupils visited Kalakuta Museum, Nike Arts Gallery, Terrakulture Arts Gallery, Freedom Park, Takwa Bay Beach, Eleko Beach and Tafawa Balewa Square. They told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that the three-days tour showed Lagos as an art and culture tourism destination. One of the pupils, Melose Dumnoi, said the tour was adventurous, with the visit to the Kalakuta Museum where the life and achievements of the late legendary musician, Fela Anikulapo-Kuti, were explained. “We were taken to Fela’s bedroom. It is quite fascinating and interesting how history is preserved. “We can’t forget the design of the Terrakulture Arts Gallery and the beautiful art pieces. There are other interesting aspects of the tour. I wish to be back soon,” she said. Another pupil, Rabia Hashim, said the visit to Nike Arts Gallery taught her in-depth interpretation of art works, which she never knew before. “I was made to understand in-depth analysis and interpretation of art works, differentiate modern and contemporary arts. My knowledge has been enriched. “I feel so challenged and want to be more creative now. In fact, Lagos is a place to be,” she said. The pupils’ coordinator, Mrs. Ngozi Ugoji, who heads the Art Department, said the pupils were brought to Lagos to explore arts and culture peculiar to the state. She said they had to come all the way because Lagos had more art galleries and tourists sites compared with Abuja. “We came to Lagos because there are many private art galleries here, unlike in Abuja where there is only one art gallery owned by the government.
