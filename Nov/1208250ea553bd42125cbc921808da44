•Amosun’s man Akinlade joins APM Three members of the caucus of the All Progressives Congress (APC) defected from the party yesterday. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) also lost one member to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) but gained another from APC. The lawmakers, in their individual letters to Speaker Yakubu Dogara, said their defection from their former parties was due to irreconcilable differences that included high handedness and unacceptable primaries. They also said their decision was in due consultations with their constituents. The defected APC members are: Adekunle Akinlade (Ogun), for Allied Peoples Movement (APM); Muhammed Ajanah (Kogi), for the PDP, while Salish Koko (Kebbi) left for SDP. Rabiu Kaugama (Jigawa) left the PDP for SDP. A subtle protest by House Leader Femi Gbajabiamila was drowned in banters and backslapping around the floor. Akinlade added a little drama to his defection by handing his APC armband to Gbajabiamila, who later approached the Speaker with it. Dogara collected and displayed the armband for his colleagues to see amidst laughter around the floor.
