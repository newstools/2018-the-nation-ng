Fuji maestro, Wasiu Alabi Odetola popularly called Pasuma has marked his 51st birthday on a low key. Popularly known as Oga Nla, he took to Instagram to express his thanks to God. “Ya Allah,” he wrote. “Thank u for another year and all the experiences that u gave me this past year.. Thank u for givin’ me all d success & achievements dat will always be happy memories for me.. Thank u for givin’ me all the happiness that gave me time to celebrate.. Thank u for givin’ me all the sadness that reminded me of my own weaknesses & made me realized that I really need u to be my guide & light in my life.. Alhamdulillah for every blessing Allah has given me. LLnP to me.” Earlier last Wednesday, Pasuma visited his alma mater, Muslim Mission Primary School, Mushin, to commission the ten block of classrooms recently renovated by the Pasuma Fans Club in the community. Addressing the pupils, Pasuma urged them to face their studies. “I was once like you people because I started from this school,” he said. “My music career started here and I will always remember having the school as part of my foundation years. “I usually sing in the school with my friends during breaks and I can never forget the impact the school had in my life.” He promised that the renovation of the classrooms is only part of the grand plans he has for the community school. To celebrate his golden age last year, Pasuma shared food, drinks and other relief materials to the less privileged. Pasuma was born on November 27, 1967 in Mushin by Mr and Mrs Otedola from Kwara State. He completed his secondary education at the Nigeria Model School, Okota, Lagos in 1984 and after he was unable to pursue his education, he opted for fuji music. He hit the limelight after the release of his song title, Orobokibo in 1995. The song earned him a special recognition as the Best Fuji artiste by AMEN and FMA Award respectively.
