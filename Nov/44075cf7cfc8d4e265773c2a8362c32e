Ekiti State Governor John Kayode Fayemi yesterday closed his case before state’s Governorship Election Petitions Tribunal sitting at the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Apo, after calling four witnesses. On Monday, Fayemi’s first witness, Mr Adunmo Rufus Sunday, a Deputy Director General of JKF Campaign Organisation, told the tribunal that the July 14 poll was free, fair and credible by all standards. The witness said contrary to the allegations of bias, violence, vote-buying and general malpractices by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Prof Olusola Kolapo, who are the petitioners, the election was devoid of rancour and violence. At the resumed hearing yesterday, Fayemi’s counsel, Mr Lateef Fagbemi (SAN), told the tribunal that he would no longer call any other witness and that he was ready to close the case. “My lord, we have called four witnesses and tendered only one exhibit so far. We have come to the conclusion that this is a good place to announce the closure of the case,” Fagbemi said. After consultation with other parties, the parties agreed that the respondents be given three days to file their written addresses and the petitioners to have five days to file their written addresses as well as three days to accord the responses the reply on point of law. Tribunal Chairman Justice Suleiman Belgore told the parties that all the addresses must come in by December 15. He adjourned the matter till January 9 for adoption of the final written addresses and oral arguments of counsel.
