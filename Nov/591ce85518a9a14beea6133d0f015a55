…Asks him to open defence Feb 21  A Federal High Court in Abuja has rejected the no-case submission made by businessman, Raymond Dokpesi and his company, Daar Investment and Holdings Company Limited in their trial on charges of alleged breach of procurement law to the tune of N2.1billion Justice John Tsoho, in a ruling on Wednesday, rejected the argument by the defence team led by Kanu Agabi (SAN), to the effect that the prosecution has not made out against the defendants to warrant their being called to enter a defence. The judge upheld the argument by the prosecution led by Rotimi Jacobs (SAN) to the effect that the court is, at this stage, only to establish whether or not a prima facie case has been established against the defendants, not to evaluate the evidence led and establish the guilt or otherwise of the defendants. Justice Tsoho said, by the evidence led by the prosecution through its witnesses, a prima facie case has been established, requiring the defendants to say their own side of the story. The defendants are being tied on a seven-count charge brought by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). They are charged with money laundering, procurement fraud and accused of fraudulently receiving N2.1bn from the office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) between January and March 2015.
