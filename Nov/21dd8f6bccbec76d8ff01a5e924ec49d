The Committee on Police Affairs, Human Rights and Justice that was mandated to carry out the investigation is expected to uncover the Issues and questions as to when the suspect died, how he died, why the Police denied the facts of his death, at what point the Police leadership discovered the death of the suspect and why the police are covering up the facts.

The decision of the lawmakers followed the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance by Zakari Mohammad (PDP, Kwara), who noted how shocking was the disclosure by the Police that Adikwu, the principal suspect in the unfortunate bank robbery in Offa, Kwara State that occurred on the 5″“ of Aprii;2018 is dead. He said: “The Police initially confirmed to the Attorney General of Kwara State through the Police Public Relations Officer Moshood Jimoh that the principal suspect was alive and in custody and was helping the police in the investigations of the robbery that led to the killing of 22 people and recovery of firearms that were carted away. “Of concern however is that it took the police so long to make the disclosure about the death of the principal suspect after denying its veracity as was reported in the media. “It is equally worrisome that there have been inconsistencies in the various statements by the police and a possible cover up of this extra-judicial killing with the aim of tarnishing the image of some innocent individuals for political p poses. “It is common knowledge that it is the constitutional duty of this hallowed chamber to take action wherever such level of irresponsibility and recklessness of an important law enforcement agency such as the Police have arisen in the course of investigations into a vicious crime”. The Committee has four weeks to carry out the assignment and report back for further legislative action.
