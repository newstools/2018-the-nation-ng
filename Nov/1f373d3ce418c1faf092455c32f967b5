 The Ebom Community in Abi Local Government Area of Cross River State has debunked media reports that they invaded their neighbours, the Usumtong Community last week. A community leader of Ebom, Chief Irem Enyim-Egu, who spoke with reporters in Calabar, said they were not part of the destruction of houses and loss of lives in a devastating attack on Usumutong. He said people from the Ebom Community had been variously attacked and abducted by trespassers in recent times, adding that they had reported the matter to the government and to the police. According to him, some young men had attacked the Ebom Community on Wednesday, and were repelled by the youth. The community leader further said the invaders were chased until they ran into Usumutong, where they retreated. “There was an attack on the Ebom community. There was a reaction because of the attack. We had to chase the invaders and we discovered that they ran back to Usumutong community. ”We have continued to hold our peace. They went and reported that many villages attacked them and they included Ebom.  We did not attack any community. There was no plan to attack them because having reported to government; we were still waiting for the government to act. “We had to defend ourselves when people invade our community. We did not chase them into their own community because elders had instructed our youths to be of good behaviour. “Reports that the Ebom people attacked Usumutong are fabrications.” Enyim-Egu urged the government as well as security agent to look into the crisis in the area with a view to ensuring lasting peace. “There is no gain when people run into crisis. We lose a lot of things. Currently, we cannot visit our farm lands because of fear that we would be ambushed,” he said.
