One of the leading real estate practitioners,  Chief Adesunbo Onitiri, has commended the ongoing distribution of tradermoni by the Federal Government to traders in parts of Lagos and its environs. In a statement issued in Lagos yesterday, Chief Onitiri said “the tradermoni being dished out to traders is a good gesture. I only quarrel with its execution. “If the policy drivers intend it to solve poverty, it is wrongly directed. What the government should do is to wipe out poverty within the rank and file of the entire populace”. According to Onitiri, “the government should create enabling environment for business to thrive. They can also pay all unemployed citizens stipends monthly, or create farm settlements for youths and train them in agriculture.”
