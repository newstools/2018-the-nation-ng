Surulere Local Government Chairman Tajudeen Ajide is excited over the formation of the Police/Eminent Personalities Forum. He pledged support for the forum at the inauguration of the forum/fundraising ceremony at the council secretariat in Surulere, Lagos Mainland. Represented by Head of Administration Akeem Adesanya, he said: “We are committed to implementing policies and programmes aimed at fighting crimes and bringing the police closer to the community.” Forum Chairperson Alhaja Lateefat Gbajabiamila said the initiative was a brainchild of Inspector-General of Police Ibrahim Idris. “The initiative was taken to deliberate on the security challenges of communities and proffer a solution,” she said. She called on the public and the corporate world for donation. Gbajabiamila, a former chairman of Surulere Local Government, said:  “The idea was formed to improve security through police-community partnership.” She said the forum planned to install Close Circuit Television (CCTV) at strategic locations in Surulere. “We look forward to your financial and moral support by donating generously towards our core project (the installation of the CCTV), to ensure a peaceful and safer community,” Gbajabiamila added. The forum’s other executive members are Alhaji Selim Alamutu (vice chairman), Bayo Odukoya, Olatunji Lawal, and Chief Jinadu Awoyemi. Present were Tajudeen Solanke, who represented House of Representatives Majority Leader Femi Gbajabiamila, Jimoh Jabaje, the Divisional Police Officer, Area ‘C’ Command, members of the Community Development Committee (CDC) and council officials.
