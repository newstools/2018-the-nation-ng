First Bank coach, Peter Ahmedu has said the quarter final game against FAP of Cameroun will be different has he hopes to take his team to the latter stages of the FIBA Africa Champions Cup for Women (ACCW), which end on Sunday in Maputo. First Bank played like a well-drilled side in the final group B game against INSS, pressing high and doing well in offense to win 83-45. However, Ahmedu has said that he would have to come up with a different approach in Friday’s game so that his team does not become predictable. He also stated that the approach at the ACCW is to take each game as they come, noting that it would be difficult to approach all the games the same way. “The quarter final game will be difficult because the competition is getting to the latter stages. “Though we are playing a team that finished fourth in group A, it doesn’t mean that the game will be easy. Our opponents are also in Maputo to vie for the trophy, so we are hoping to win and qualify for the semi finals,” Ahmedu added. When reminded that the same team fell to his team when they met two years ago also in Mozambique, the D’Tigress assistant coach replied that he wasn’t bothered about the score but the win, which will take his team to the semi finals. “I don’t want to talk about score. The most important thing is the win. We are going to change over style a bit because we need to be flexible as we don’t want to give our opponents that we are a one-style team.” He also said that his team would have to step up their game so that they can send fear into the heart of their next opponents. The Nigerian team captained by Nkechi Akashili will take on FAP at the Pavilhao do Maxaquene 3.30 pm Nigerian time.
