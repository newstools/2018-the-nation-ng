IN demonstration of its commitment to the advancement of the entertainment industry in Nigeria, Access Bank has again partnered the Africa International Film Festival (AFRIFF) to project great African stories to the world. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 2018 edition of the event in Lagos, Dr. Hebert Wigwe, Group Managing Director/CEO of Access Bank Plc, expressed delight that the Bank has been able to contribute towards an initiative which works to change the way the world perceives the African continent through film. “Access Bank remains dedicated and committed to the creative revolution of the African continent and we want the rest of the world to know us, understand us, and see us for who we genuinely are. We are a people of great talent, rich culture, strength, hope, grace, beauty and much more. “We are championing creative works that are ‘Born in Africa’, and our quest to be part of revolutionizing the current narrative runs deep. There is no better or faster way to do this than through film which travels around the world in seconds. Technology has also made it possible and convenient for everyone to consume film on mobile devices. We are grateful to be a part of AFRIFF and similar projects, which will surely change both how Africans are seen globally and how the international market interacts with Africa as it concerns business”. Access Bank also supports the industry through Accelerate TV, a multimedia outlet devoted to entertaining, educating and empowering the masses. In the same vein, the Bank is currently working on projects that will enhance the perception of Africa by drawing the attention of the global community to the continent’s culture, arts and lifestyle. This is in line with the Bank’s efforts to position the African continent as a prime destination for viable investment.
