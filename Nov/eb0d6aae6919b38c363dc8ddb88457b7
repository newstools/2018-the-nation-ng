HNK Gorica of Croatia full-back Musa Muhammed has been handed a route back into international football with Nigeria as Coach Gernot Rohr has included him in his list of players for the upcoming games against South Africa and Uganda. ” It was an error from the people who typed the list. Musa Muhammed is on standby as well. I included him on the list. He is on the list”, Rohr exclusively told Owngoalnigeria.com in a chat from his base in France. The former captain of the Nigeria U17 and 20 teams last played for the B team of Nigeria in the 2-3 loss to Spanish side Atletico Madrid before Nigeria’s participation at the World Cup in Russia. Prior to that time, he has made three senior appearances for the main team of Nigeria but his unstable club career cost him his spot in the team, but since moving to Croatia he has found his rhythm. So far he has played in nine league games in Croatia for high flying Gorica and although he started out as a left fullback, he has since moved to the position of right full-back where he has posted commanding performances the past few weeks.
