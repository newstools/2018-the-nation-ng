Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr is taking the Africa Cup of Nations qualifier away to South Africa, like a Cup final and has vowed to beat the hosts in Johannesburg or at least get a draw that would be enough to pick a ticket for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations. The Franco-German tactician is eyeing a repeat performance of Eagles’ qualification for the 2018 World Cup held in Russia when Nigeria got the qualification ticket before playing the last qualification match. Rohr disclosed to NationSport from his base in Germany, “we want to qualify from this group if possible in the next game away to South Africa in Johannesburg which means we will do the same thing that we did for the qualification for the 2018 World Cup held in Russia that is to be qualified for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations before our last match is played against Seychelles in Nigeria. “If we have a point in South Africa we have qualified even if Libya wins in Seychelles and also win at home against South Africa, they will get 10 points. But with our 10 points, we will still qualify for 2019 AFCON. But our ambition and resolve is to beat South Africa but a draw would suffice”, Rohr assured.
