A Federal High Court in Osogbo, Osun State, yesterday refused to grant bail to a former Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) lecturer, Prof. Richard Akindele, charged with demanding sex to pass his student, Monica Osagie. Justice Maureen Onyetenu ordered Akindele to be remanded in Ilesa Prison until December 17. She ordered the prosecution counsel from the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) to produce video evidence of the lecturer and his student allegedly having fun. ICPC Senior Legal Officer Mr Kehinde Adetoye had prayed the court to deny the defendant bail on the grounds that he would not appear for his trial when released. He argued that the defendant had refused to turn up at the ICPC office in Abuja after a written agreement to honour any invitation extended to him, particularly on his return from abroad on a medical trip. Defence counsel Mr. Francis Omotosho prayed the court to grant his client bail pending the final determination of the case. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that the lecturer was first arraigned before Justice Maureen Onyetenu on November 19 by the ICPC on four counts of alteration of age and demanding sex to pass his student.
