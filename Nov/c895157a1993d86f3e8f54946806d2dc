The man who attacked Borussia Dortmund’s bus with a bomb has been found guilty of 28 counts of attempted murder and sentenced to 14 years in prison. A court in Dortmund convicted the man, a dual German-Russian national known as Sergej W, on Tuesday for the attack carried out on April 11, 2017 when the German side was in the road to a Champions League clash against Monaco. The explosion occurred shortly after the players commence on their journey from their hotel and left centre-back Marc Bartra needing surgery on a fractured wrist and shrapnel in his arm. A police officer was also injured in the attack, but no other Dortmund players or members of staff were hurt, though Bartra described the incident as: “the longest 15 minutes of my life”. The culprit admitted to making and setting off three bombs in the attack, but he has denied that he tried to kill anyone in the process. The bombing was part of a money-making scheme. On the day of the attack, the 29-year-old bought 15,000 shares worth €44,000 with the expectation that the club’s stock price would plummet and allow him to sell them on for a large profit. Instead, the share price rose in the wake of the attack.
