A Federal High Court in Osogbo, Osun State, yesterday ordered that the “sex-for-mark” sacked senior lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, (OAU) Ile-Ife, Prof. Richard Akindele, should be remanded in prison custody. Justice Maurine Onyetenu ordered that Akindele be remanded at Ilesa prison for demanding sex from his post graduate student, Monica Osagie, before she could pass his course. The Professor of Management and Accounting was arraigned on a four- count charge by the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Commission (ICPC). The anti-graft agency alleged that the accused unlawfully demanded sex from his student and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section A (1)(2) of the Corrupt Practices and other related Offences Law. The accused pleaded not guilty. Defence counsel Mr. F. Omotosho, who urged the court to grant his client bail, said: “He is a known professor and cannot jump bail.” The prosecutor, who is a senior legal officer with the ICPC, Mr. Kehinde Adetoye, opposed the oral bail application, saying the accused had refused to appear at the commission since he was granted administrative bail. He said: “We have been making efforts since November 5 to effect the service of the process. They have refused to come back and they were not reachable on the phone. We are surprised to see them here today. We just served them the process.” Justice Onyetenu directed counsel to the accused to file a formal application for the bail of his client. She ordered that the accused be remanded in prison custody at Ilesa and adjourned the matter till November 27 for definite hearing.
