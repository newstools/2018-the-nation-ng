The Minister of Budget and National Planning, Udoma Udo Udoma has called for new investments in nutrition and food security in the country. He spoke why flagging off the 2018 Nutrition Week aimed at increasing awareness on the dangers posed by malnutrition and serve as a platform for mobilizing stakeholders to invest in nutrition. Udoma who was represented at the event by the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry, Olajide Odewale, said the state of Nigeria’s food and nutrition is of utmost interest to the Government at all levels because if the situation is not attended to, malnutrition which is sometimes referred to as “the Silent Killer”, could lead to the death of young children. Experts, he pointed out, say an estimated 2.5 million children under the age of five years might be in danger of being afflicted by severe acute malnutrition in Nigeria, a development he noted, is quite worrisome and calls for emergency measures to arrest the trend. He said this year’s theme: “Nutrition: An Emergency”, was chosen to draw attention to the urgent measures that need to be taken by all relevant stakeholders in combating malnutrition. “It is important to combat Malnutrition, because as I indicated earlier, it can cause death in young children, particularly those under five years of age,” he added.
