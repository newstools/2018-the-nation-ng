A 36-year-old cerebral palsy patient,  Benson Emmanuel, will on Saturday unveil a music album titled: ‘Dominion’, at Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) Peace Pavilion in  Ojokoro, Lagos. Emmanuel, a gospel musician, said the launch of the five-track album, which would be his fourth, is a call to Christians to wake-up to their responsibilities. He said his motivation to singing began when God healed him from being deaf and dumb after 17 years. “It was after this healing that I was inspired by God to come up with a music album yearly and I choose to launch an album during every convention of the RCCG. “Even though my medical report some years ago said there was no remedy to my challenge, but God changed my story around from being deaf and dumb to be able to listen and talk. Even though I still have some challenge, I will still use this opportunity to make a great impact in my generation. “God has used me to touch many lives through all the albums that I have launched and I have sold over 30, 000 copies. He recalled that he had faced much rejection over the years, especially at the time he wanted to launch his first album, due to his challenge. “I went to many studios but nobody wanted to produce my song because of the way I talk, but in Gods mercy, I produced my first album, the second, third and now the fourth to be launched,” he said. Emmanuel added that with all the money he made from his first album, he was able to open a studio where he recorded this other albums. He urged upcoming artists to be productive and believe in themselves. He urged the government to help those physically challenged
