 Jamaican sprinter and eight time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt may come face to face with Nigeria international Ogenyi Onazi if he succeeds in getting a deal with Turkish side Sivasspor. The Turkish first division side according to reports is ready to offer the Jamaican a second chance to have a go at professional football. Bolt who retired from the tracks in 2017 made is keen on switching sports and making a career in football. The 6ft 5in 32-year-old, who prefers to play as a striker, had a trial with Central Coast Mariners in Australia earlier this year and scored two goals in a 4-0 friendly win over Macarthur South West United during October. Bolt’s trial Down Under failed to materialize into his first professional football contract, but according to TRT World, Sivasspor may be set to offer the speedster a deal for the second half of the European season. Sivasspor are currently 11th in Turkey’s top division, having finished seventh last season. Bolt would not be the first big name on the club’s books, with former Brazil star Robinho already among the playing staff. Other internationals at Sivasspor include Carl Medjani, Arouna Kone, Gabriel Torje and Douglas. Whether Bolt would be interested in joining Sivasspor is not yet clear. Bolt recently revealed that he had ‘received offers from many clubs’, but hinted that his hopes of landing his dream deal may be fading. He added: ‘I will make a decision at the end of November. Either I will continue or I will end my dreams. This is not about money. This is my dream.’ Should the deal see the light of the day, Bolt may in the course of the season file out against Onazi who was left out in the AFCON qualifier at the FNB Stadium where Super Eagles pulled a draw against Bafana Bafana but still picked a ticket to the 2019 event in Cameroon with a game left against Seychelles in March. Onazi plays for Trabzonspor who currently occupy the 10th position on the log just a point above Sivasspor
