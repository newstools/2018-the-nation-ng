Australia-based highlife singer Elder Nwabueze Ukonne who is also known as Daddy Danny King is presently in Nigeria to promote his latest album titled ‘ASA NWA BABY’. The singer, known for playing the traditional highlife tune to fans abroad, said that he is quite different. “Music is inborn and that is why I am a bit different from other Nigerian musicians,” Danny King said. “I started my musical career long time ago. And I’m known for best practices in the musical industry in Nigeria. I have been fighting this course for quite a long time but have not been able to sail to the top.” On his visit to Nigeria, he said, “I came into the country some months ago to drop my latest Album ‘ASA NWA BABY’, which is right now on air in different radio stations. Well, in Austria where I am based my music makes good waves but not as much because this is not a country that is too good with blacks.” He also pleaded that Nigerians should support their own and not allow talented artistes be wasted. “So I am using this medium to appeal to all music lovers to support. Please do not allow this great God given talent to die.” The musician who recently played at the National stadium to showcase his skills is said to have taken after his late mother, Mrs. Mary Chijioke Ukonne, who was also a singer and an entertainer.
