A 20-year-old man, Basit Yusuf, was on Wednesday arraigned at a Magistrates’ Court in Ado-Ekiti for allegedly killing Saliu Jamiu. Yusuf, whose address was not provided, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and murder. The police prosecutor, Insp. Monica Ikebuilo, told the court that the accused committed the offence in Ado-Ekiti on Nov. 7. She alleged that the accused had earlier threatened to kill Jamiu if he failed to procure a motorcycle for him. Ikebuilo said that some days after the threat, the body of the deceased was found in a canal in the Odo-Ado neighbourhood of Ado-Ekiti. “The accused was later then apprehended by the police when he tried to escape,’’ she said. She said that the offences contravened Section 324 and 319 (1) of the Criminal Law of Ekiti State, 2012. The prosecutor then urged the Court to remand the accused in prison custody, pending legal advice from the office of Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). The plea of the accused was not taken. In her ruling, the Magistrate, Mrs Omolola Akosile, ordered that the accused should be remanded in prison and adjourned the case until Dec.13 for mention. NAN
