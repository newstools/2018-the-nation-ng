Abubakar said that two houses were burnt during the incident. He said the situation had been brought under control and that investigation was going on to get to the root of the crisis.

According to Abubakar, the crisis started following a misunderstanding among some youths at a birthday party in Kusu area of Sakani which later spread to other parts of Yelwa Ward. A resident of the area, who preferred anonymity, told NAN that some youths in Lushi started throwing stones at each other and later embarked on burning houses which included that of a retired superintendent of police. The eye witness said that the incident might have started when two male youths fought over a young lady at the venue of the birthday party. According to him, a federal civil servant who worked at the Federal Secretariat in Bauchi, was suspected to be among those killed during the fight. He said the victim had earlier relocated his family to a safe area following tension in the area, but was killed on his return by the irate youths who also burnt the deceasedâ€™s house. NAN
