 Super Eagles and Trabzonspor midfielder Ogenyi Onazi was the guest of 2018 Federation cup runners up Kano Pillars Wednesday in Abuja. Onazi who missed Super Eagles two legged African Nations Cup qualifier against Bafana Bafana of South Africa as well as the friendly match against Cranes of Uganda, donated N500, 000 to the team during training to the delight of club officials. Pillars took to the social media to inform its numerous fans of Onazi’s visit and the donation he made. “@NGSuperEagles player @OnaziOgenyi donated ₦500k to Kano Pillars FC today during training session in Abuja” the club informed. Onazi interestingly was subject of a recent media chat with Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr, with the German tactician denying insinuations in some quarters that the former Lazio ace is no longer part of his plans following a rift. “It is not true that I have issues with Ogenyi” he submitted adding however that there will be no automatic shirt for any player ahead of AFCON 2019 in Cameroon. “Every player has to be at his best” he added Nigeria has already picked a ticket for the continental fiesta even with a match against Seychelles in match next year to spare. The Eagles missed the last two editions of the Nations cup in Equatorial Guinea and Gabon respectively and will be hoping to return with a bang in Cameroon, the first time 24 teams will be featuring in the event.
