Thembi Kgatlana scored a superb goal as South Africa got their African Women’s Cup of Nations campaign off to a dream start with a 1-0 victory over defending champions in Cape Coast‚ Ghana yesterday. The decisive moment in the match came five minutes from the end when Kgatlana‚ sent off the bench as an impact player by coach Desiree Ellis‚ drilled a volley into the back of the net after being set up by Jermaine Seoposenwe. It is her 11th goal in 41 appearances for Banyana. This will be a massive boost for Banyana Banyana in their bid to finish in the top three at the continental finals and seal a place at next year’s Fifa Women’s World Cup in France. Nigeria’s next game comes up on Wednesday against Zambia and then South Africa takes on Equatorial Guinea same day.
