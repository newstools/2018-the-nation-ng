The event is one of the Lagos State government approved annual cultural events. Speaking at a press conference to update the public about the event scheduled to take place on Saturdaay December 8, at the Ikorodu Town hall in Ikorodu, the chairman of the publicity       subcommittee for the festival, Comrade Olalekan Murisiku, stated that the event, which was first held last year, has been rebranded and repackaged to further project the uniqueness of the Asa masquerade to the world. He described the event as part of the commitment of the State Government to use entertainment as a springboard to drive development and market the state’s potentials to domestic and foreign investors who will contribute meaningfully towards making Lagos a smart city. He said the Majority Leader of the Lagos state House of Assembly, Hon. S.O.B Agunbiade, who initiated the festival, is still very much committed to making it a world class annual event.

The Ikorodu Rennaisance Project (IREP) as well as Hon. S.O.B Agunbiade, who initiated the festival, are still unrelenting in their determination to sell Asa to the world as a tourists attraction.”
