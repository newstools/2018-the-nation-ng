•’Exercise to keep fit’ The Rector of the Lagos State Polytechnic, Mr. Samuel Sogunro, yesterday advised workers of the institution to always exercise in order to keep fit and remain healthy. The rector, who spoke during a walk tagged “Walk for Life”, also urged the workers to inculcate the habit of exercising and living a healthy life. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the exercise took place on the school premises before the beginning of work. Sogunro said many workers did not create time to exercise because of their busy schedule, thereby affecting their health. He said no progress could be achieved where “a worker usually goes on sick leave.” “There is need for employers and employees in institutions of higher learning and all stakeholders to exercise and check their health status regularly. “Walking is a great way to improve or maintain your overall health. Just 30 minutes’ walk every day can increase cardiovascular fitness, strengthen bones, reduce excess body fat and boost muscle power and endurance. “Unlike other forms of exercise, walking is free and doesn’t require any special equipment or training. “Physical activity does not have to be vigorous or done for a long period in order to improve your health,” the rector said.
