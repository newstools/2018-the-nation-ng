The Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) has released the ownership structure of all banks operating in Nigeria. The report, contained in the corporation’s annual report, showed that foreign investors and government are divesting from Nigerian lenders, as private sector operators gain control of the sector. “In comparison to the previous year, there was a slight change in the ownership structure of banks. The private sector continues to dominate the ownership of Nigerian banks while government continues to divest from banks in line with requirements of Code of Corporate Governance for banks and discount houses. “Government shareholding was below 10 per cent in all the banks except Jaiz Bank plc,” the corporation said in its 2017 annual report obtained at the weekend. The report shows that 15 banks out of the 26 lenders had partial or full foreign ownership in 2017, with five banks having substantial foreign ownership above 50 per cent.
