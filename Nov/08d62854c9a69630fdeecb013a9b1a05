Sustainable Cycling Foundation (SCF) and Cycology Riding Club will stage the Lagos City Criterium on Sunday. The event will take place at the Dolphin Estate loop, Ikoyi. The Lagos City Criterium is a bicycle racing competition consisting of several laps around a closed circuit. Last year’s edition had an ex-Tour De France cyclist, Andrea Tonti, as a guest appearance. According to Temitope George, spokesperson of the Cycology Club, this year’s edition will be bigger, as professional cyclists and enthusiasts within and outside Nigeria will make inroad to Lagos to witness teams compete for N1million naira prize money. “Participating teams will be competing under six categories – Pro male /female, masters’ male/female, and junior male/female categories,” she said. The competition is backed by the Lagos State government through the Lagos State Sports Commission. According to SCF, the aim of the criterium is to promote cycling as a sport and means of recreation amongst Nigerians. SCF chairman, Faiz Imam, said “one of the goals is to build cycling to the same level as football in Nigeria where we see a representation of Nigeria at international events like the Tour De France.” For Cycology Riding Club, the aim is to promote grassroots cycling whilst maintaining a healthy lifestyle. “The criterium remains one of the most important platforms through which Cycology promotes cycling as a tool for healthy living and social development,” Cycology Vice-Captain Tunde Laoye said.
