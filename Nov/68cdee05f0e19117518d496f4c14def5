A National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member serving at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Mr. Johnson Eseoghene, has sunk a borehole in Zhidu Village in Lugbe area of Abuja, ending the villagers’potable water challenge. A crowd of residents gathered at the ceremony where the project was inaugurated, praising the Corps member for the gesture. CAMPUSLIFE gathered that the community, for many years, had been battling lack of basic amenities, including healthcare, water and road, which increased the risk of diseases outbreak in the village due to poor sanitation. Johnson, who served in the community, rose to the challenge, initiating the water project to improve hygiene . Speaking on the reason he embarked on the project, Johnson, who is the president of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Community Development Service (CDS) group, said he was disturbed by the absence of basic amenities in the community, which he said increased the villagers’ vulnerability to preventable disease. He noted there was nothing indicating government’s presence in Zhidu community when he was deployed to serve in the community, saying the residents were exposed to unclean water for domestic use. The Corps member said the project was carried out as his personal CDS. The public borehole was funded by Hope Spring Water. He said: “The motivation that pushed me to carry out is this borehole project in Zhidu community is the lack of safe water in the village. Women and children, especially young girls, trek long distances to get water for their families. Children have died in the community from water-related diseases. I believe that providing the borehole will go a long way to save many lives and bring more development to Zhidu community.” NYSC officials and members of the community praised Johnson for the initiative.
