The Ondo State government has warned residents against yellow fever outbreak in several parts of the country. A statement by the Commissioner for Health, Dr. Wahab Adegbenro, said the residents should be proactive as the outbreak had spread to neighbouring states. This, the commissioner said, calls for serious concern. Adegbenro described yellow fever as a serious viral infection that can affect all ages and is usually transmitted by mosquitoes. He listed some of its symptoms to include fever, body ache, vomiting, yellowness of the eyes and bleeding, in serious cases. The commissioner advised the residents to maintain proper hygiene in their environment and sleep under mosquito nets. He said everyone should be on guard, report to the nearest hospital when they notice any of the aforementioned symptoms and avoid self-medication. Adegbenro also urged health workers to be at alert, investigate all feverish cases and alert appropriate authorities when there is any suspected case.
