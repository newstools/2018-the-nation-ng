health practitioners have been tasked to scale up the quality in health service delivery thereby meeting up with global standards. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the 41st Annual General Meeting and Scientific Conference, tagged ‘Eko 2019’, which was held in Ikeja, Lagos, the Minister of State for Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire, pointed out that for this to take place, there is need for a complete overhaul in the health sector. His words: “The change in the health sector should not be mere rhetorical calls but rather change of attitude as regards transparency, accountability, diligence and discipline in resource management and service delivery.” According to Ehanire, it is disheartening to know that people’s faith in the health care is poor, hence the need for a paradigm shift in the healthcare delivery in Nigeria.
