Health insurance provider Hygeia HMO and the Audrey Pack Company Limited are partnering on the reduction of maternal and child mortality. They have signed a memorandum of understanding (Mou) in Lagos. The partnership is aimed at reducing the number of women who die during child birth. Starting at only N65,000, Hygeia’s plan provides cover for antenatal care during pregnancy as well as cost of delivery. A mum-to-be pack for expectant mothers and a newborn pack after delivery that contains essentials for each stage of the life giving journey are included. Announcing the deal, Obinna Ukachukwu, Hygeia HMO’s Executive Head for Business Development & Strategy, said the plan was essential as a private-sector-led initiative to improve the quality of healthcare women get throughout their maternity. “Hygeia HMO has a long-term goal to ensure that the vast majority of Nigerians get covered by health insurance and this is an effective way to pool the power of aggregated risks and use it to improve Nigeria’s efforts towards the crucial SDG 3.1 goal to reduce maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. HyMat + The Audrey Pack gets us closer to bridging that gap.” Audrey Pack also brings with it access to a community of women who volunteer their expertise to help expectant mothers. The deal  with Hygeia includes a free subscription to MTNAudreyCare service where enrolees receive SMS updates on nutrition, fitness and other developmental content. Lilian Odim, the founder/chief executive, The Audrey Pack Company, said: “In line with the SDG 3 goal, I believe that the health and well-being of mothers is an indication of the health and state of a nation. The decline in maternal and child mortality lies in the collaborative efforts between various industries, including the public sector. This is why I am certain that the Hygeia HMO- Audrey Pack partnership will take us closer to this goal.”
