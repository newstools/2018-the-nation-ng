THE People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has disowned what it described as a phony presidential campaign timetable presently circulating in some traditional and social media platforms. PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement yesterday, said the party has not released any timetable or timeline for its presidential campaign. Calling on its members and supporters to disregard the fake timetable, the party said the presidential campaign council would soon come up with the authentic timetable. The statement said: “The fabricators of the post, even went further to allocate venues and dates for zonal rallies, which they claimed to have emanated from the PDP Presidential Campaign Council. “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP clarifies that it has not yet released any timetable or timelines for our presidential campaigns. Similarly, our party has not yet allotted any dates or venues for our campaigns.”
