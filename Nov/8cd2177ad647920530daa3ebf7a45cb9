Ahead of next year’s general elections, a Second Republic senator and National Leader of Pan-Yoruba group, Afenifere, Chief Ayo Fasanmi, has promised to convene a meeting of Yoruba leaders. The meeting, he said, will discuss the need for the Southwest to forge a common front and plan how to put the interest of the race in proper perspective. Notable leaders of the Yoruba, including all Southwest governors, traditional rulers and politicians, are expected to attend the meeting. The convocation of the meeting was made known when leaders of Afenifere in Ekiti State visited Fasanmi at his home in Osogbo, the Osun State capital, where they reviewed happenings in Nigeria and national issues that affect the Southwest. The visiting Afenifere chieftains also discussed the need for Yoruba leaders to put their house in order and avoid jeopardising the interest of the race in the national polity. Following the visit, a communique was issued. It was signed by the Chairman of the Afenifere in Ekiti State, Elder Yemi Alade, the Women Leader, Mrs. Monisola Oloro (née Fayemi), and its Publicity Secretary, Chief Biodun Akin-Fasae. The communique hailed Southwest governors for their “unceasing commitment” to the welfare of the people. It praised President Muhammadu Buhari and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo for “bringing the nation back on its feet and back from the brink of bankruptcy economically and morally”. Afenifere acknowledged their efforts at laying a solid foundation for the development of the nation in all sectors of the economy. The group commiserated with foremost Afenifere leader, Senator Biyi Durojaye, who recently lost two daughters.
