The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has lamented the incessant but avoidable killings of Nigerian soldiers by Boko Haram insurgents in the Northeast. In a statement issued yesterday by the spokesman for the PDP, the party demanded explanations from President Muhammadu Buhari on the killing on Sunday of over 70 Nigerian soldiers. The soldiers, attached to the 157 Task Force Battalion in Melete, Borno State, were attacked and killed by invading insurgents. The PDP lamented that the insurgents has reportedly sent a threat letter the previous Friday, stating their intention to take over military locations in the area. The main opposition party said the clarification from the Buhari Presidency was necessary in view of the consistent claims by the government that the insurgents have been defeated. The PDP expressed worries about reports of alleged compromises, neglect and inattention to military formations in the Northeast, leading to the vulnerability of the soldiers engaged in the counter insurgency war. The statement said: “This is in addition to apprehensions by Nigerians that the Buhari Presidency has been distracting our military by dragging our Service Chiefs to participate in his re-election campaign activities, instead of concentrating on their statutory duties. “The PDP however notes that it still has implicit faith in the Nigerian military and urged the Buhari Presidency to desist from acts that tend to whittle the proficiency and compromise the safety of our men and women who are daily risking their lives in defence of our nation. “Our party, therefore, charges President Buhari to be alive to his responsibility as the Commander-in-Chief by immediately reviewing his parade to ensure greater professionalism and welfare of our officers and men. “Finally, the PDP calls on Nigerians not to despair in the face of this ugly development but continue to join forces with our security agencies in the effort to cleanse our land of bandits, insurgents and marauders.”
