THE People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the National Assembly to begin investigation into alleged compromises that led to the killing of over 100 Nigerian soldiers by Boko Haram insurgents. The PDP also accused the Presidency of condoning extra-judicial killing and demanded an immediate forensic inquiry into the reported killing of a principal witness in the Offa robbery incident, Michael Adikwu, in the custody of the Kwara State Police Command. The main opposition party said investigation into the killing of soldiers in Metele, Borno State, has become imperative given reports of compromises and alleged failure of the authorities to promptly act on a reported threat by insurgents to attack the base and other military locations in the area, a few days before the attack. A statement yesterday by PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan said the probe has become expedient going by a disturbing video circulating in the public domain, showing soldiers, weeks before the attack, giving accounts of their neglect by the authorities, resulting in their vulnerability to insurgents. The statement said: “The PDP, therefore, urges the National Assembly to unravel the compromises leading to the killing of our soldiers and those behind them.” Similarly, the party also insisted that an inquest into the extra-judicial killing of the principal suspect in the Offa robbery has become essential following conflicting reports by the police over the cause and circumstances surrounding the death in police custody. The PDP noted that the police had initially claimed that the witness was killed in the course of arrest, but later claimed that he died in the course of investigation, only to again declare that he was discovered dead just as he was about to be taken to court.
