•’Cole will protect Rivers people’ Convener, Tonye Cole Volunteer Group, Mrs. Ibifuro Tatua has said she is confident that the All Progressives Congress (APC) will have sweeping victory in 2019 elections. Tatua spoke yesterday at a meeting with South south leaders in the public, private and non-profit sectors. She spoke on “Leadership, Service in the Country and 2019 Elections”. She also criticised Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike for spreading defamatory statements about the APC. She accused Wike of working to prejudice the minds of Nigerians by deliberate lies and perversion of the truth. She siad: “We are feeling the pulse of Rivers people. APC will win in 2019. Lies, threats and other attempts to bully the electorate will not play a factor in the 2019 Rivers State governorship election.” “Governor Wike left many dumbfounded with his misleading, careless and inappropriate comments as he accused the Federal Government of planning to plant 800 guns in Rivers State, with the objective of destabilising it. “Wike’s scurrilous claims are 100 per cent false. The PDP governorship candidate faces rejection in 2019 from the people because of his poor performance, white elephant projects and tendency to speak first and think later.” According to her, the Rivers State APC governorship candidate, Mr. Tonye Cole, would safeguard the security and liberty of Rivers people, reform education and improve the state’s economy, infrastructure and people’s well-being. “Nyesom Wike is an incompetent leader; the people have suffered. Tonye Cole will work for the progress of Rivers State; he will transform Rivers into a manufacturing state. His policies will benefit the poor, downtrodden and the elite,” she added.
