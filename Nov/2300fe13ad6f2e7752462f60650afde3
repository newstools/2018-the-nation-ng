Arewa Community in Lagos State has expressed it’s support for the All Progressive Congress (APC) in next year’s elections. It leader, Alhaji Dandama Yabo, disclosed this during a media chat at his office in Ketu, Lagos suburb. He said the community has been supporting APC leaders, including  Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Babatunde Raji Fashola and Akinwunmi Ambode. He noted that the group has embraced the APC governorship candidate, babajide Sanwo-Olu. Yabo said: “We do not have any other party apart from the APC. We did massive campaigns and rallies in different places during the time of Asiwaju and we did it for free. When  Fashola came, we did the same and we ensured that he was voted as governor. Also, when Ambode came, the whole Arewa community gathered together and we gave our full support. “Now that it is Sanwo-Olu, we will not relent. We will do as we have always done and our support is guaranteed.” Yabo said he has already begun consultations with various Arewa groups in Lagos State to ensure massive support for Sanwo-Olu. He added: “We Arewa of Lagos state will support APC. APC is taking governorship and presidency in 2019.
