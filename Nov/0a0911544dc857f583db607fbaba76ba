A former Anambra State governor and the vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mr. Peter Obi, has urged Nigerians to continue to pray for the repose of the soul of former Biafra warlord, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu, who died on November 26, 2011, exactly eight years today. He spoke yesterday at domestic wing of the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Ikeja, the Lagos State capital, in response to a question on how he would like Ojukwu to be remembered. Obi advised Nigerians, no matter their state of origin, not to perceive Ojukwu as their own or an ethnic figure. The former governor said those close to the late warlord marvelled at his sense of amity and desire for national unity built on equity, trust and belief that the country should be administered in a manner that it would accommodate all the constituent ethnic groups. Recalling that many qualities and legacies of Ojukwu remain veritable lessons for nation-building, Obi said: “The way he was accepted is a lesson all Nigerians should emulate – that we must accept one another in the spirit of love, unity and progress of the country.”
