The Lagos State Government will on Sunday unveil the new statue of the late Chief Gani Fawehinmi, at Freedom Park, Ojota. The park is  named after the late Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) and human rights’ crusader. Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, members of the Gani Fawehinmi family, leading voices in human rights and other dignitaries are billed to unveil the edifying statue in commemoration of the late activist’s 80th posthumous birthday. A statement yesterday by Commissioner for Tourism, Arts & Culture, Steve Ayorinde, said the remodelling of the magnificent Gani Fawehinmi statue is part of the state’s strategy to enhance the aesthetic of open public spaces and parks and to immortalise icons that contributed to the development of the state. According to him, the new statue was bourne out of a desire by the government to project and entrench the enduring legacy of the  foremost human right lawyer, activist, philanthropist and one of the icons of pro-democracy movement in Nigeria. He said: “Lagos State is proud that the late Chief  Fawehinmi’s courageous voice was loud enough for the world to take notice of socio-political developments in Nigeria. His fearless activism and constant interventions on behalf of the voiceless were legendary and helped ignite global interest on the plight of the masses and on Lagos as a liberal state that created an enabling environment for voices against oppression to be heard,” Ayorinde said. The 34-feet high statue will serve as one of the many iconic edifices that highlight the Akinwunmi Ambode-led administration’s quest to transform the landscape of the state with artistic aesthetics, while also signposting the belief in giving honour to whom honour is due, the commissioner explained.
