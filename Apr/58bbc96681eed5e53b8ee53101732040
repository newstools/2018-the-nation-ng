The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) has hosted the Director-General of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who is on his first official visit to Nigeria. During the visit, NCDC’s Chief Executive Officer Dr. Chikwe Ihekweazu highlighted the contributions of WHO to the organisation, thanking the DG for its support to the agency’s activities which include outbreak preparedness and response. He emphasised the strong partnership between the two bodies, saying it is key to strengthening national health security. Some of the activities the agency carried out in collaboration with WHO include the Joint External Evaluation (JEE) of the country’s International Health Regulations (IHR) capacity, response to outbreaks of Monkeypox, yellow fever, Cerebrospinal Meningitis and Lassa fever. In addition, the support from WHO has been key to the development of Nigeria’s National Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) action plan, and processes for operational research. In her feedback, the Regional Director of WHO African Region, Dr. Moeti Rebecca Matsishido applauded the work of the agency, highlighting that NCDC serves as a model agency for other African countries, which should be adopted in other regions in the world. The DG reiterated the commitment of the organisation to support the work of NCDC, recognising the importance of effective primary healthcare systems in supporting health security.   He said: “Universal Health Coverage and health security are two sides of the same coin.” The DG’s delegation included the six Regional Directors from across the world, three Deputy-Director Generals and WHO Nigeria Country Representative. The visit ended with a tour of the new NCDC’s Incident Coordination Centre.
