Havard-trained cardiovascular surgeon, Dr. Azeez Adeduntan, has declared his interest in the governorship seat of Oyo State. Adeduntan, who is currently the Commissioner for Health in the state, made his intention to succeed Governor Abiola Ajimobi known yesterday when he led thousands of his supporters to the All Progressives Congress (APC) State Secretariat, Oke Ado, Ibadan, where he was received by the party executives and leaders. He was a former governorship candidate of the Labour Party in the state during the 2011 general election. “When you look at those people aspiring for the position, there are contenders and pretenders. I am a contender and by the grace of God I am the next governor of Oyo State. I have done my best to uplift Oyo State in the last 19 months as a commissioner. I thank my brother, Ajimobi, for giving me the opportunity to serve the state,” he said. Highlighting his vision, Adeduntan noted that he was poised at transforming the state into a medicine hub that would rival the likes of University College Hospital (UCH) and others in the country. According to him, “leaders can emerge from any part of the state. I am not contesting as a candidate of Ibadan but Oyo State. We won’t allow the state to retrogress.” Welcoming the guests to the party office in the presence of other party leaders, the state party chairman, Chief Akin Oke, hailed the medical specialist for his laudable professional efforts which have brought so much fame to the state from across the globe. The party leader assured that all the aspirants will be given level playing field for the best to emerge.
