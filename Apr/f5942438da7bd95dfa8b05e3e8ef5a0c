Armed policemen on Monday stormed the Abuja home of embattled Senator Dino Melaye to arrest him. The Kogi West senator also had a brush with the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) operatives at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport where he was stopped from leaving the country. Our reporter, who visited Melaye’s 11 Sangha Street, Maitama, Abuja, residence, witnessed a horde of armed police personnel milling around his house. Apart from the presence of the police in their numbers, an unmarked police pick up van was also used to block the street near Melaye’s residence. All vehicular movement in and around the house was blocked by police forcing motorists to beat a retreat. The policemen were led by an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) who refused to disclose his name. Asked why the policemen besieged Melaye’s house, the ACP declined comment and directed journalists to refer their enquiry to the Force Public Relations Officer, Jimoh Moshood.
