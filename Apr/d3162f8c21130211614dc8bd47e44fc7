Nasarawa State Police Commissioner Ahmed Bello lamented yesterday that suspected herdsmen killed three of his men on duty on Monday in two separate attacks in Awe and Keana local government areas.. Bello told reporters that five persons had been arrested in connection with the killings. Those arrested he listed as: Bawa Alhaji, Aliyu Waziri, Muhammed Auta Riga, Sale Muhammad and Alhaji Adamu Auta. He said they were all arrested in Riga Auta along Radio House in Keana local government. He said items recovered from them include one AK 47 rifle with 30 rounds of 7.62mm live ammunition,.  Investigation into the killings are ongoing, he added. Ahmed said: “It is quite unfortunate that these attacks were not only unleashed on innocent citizens, but also on security personnel who are trying to restore peace and order in the affected communities.” “On April 16, 2018 there were attacks on our men while responding to distress calls in Awe and Keana local government areas, which led to the loss of three police personnel on peacekeeping mission.”. Ahmed said so far, 16 suspected Fulani herders had been arrested by Nasarawa state police command in connection with the ongoing killings and for committing various offences in Obi, Awe and Keana local government areas of the state. The police boss announced the arrest of four Fulani mercenaries who he said migrated from Shendam in Plateau state to Azara  in Awe local government to unleash terror. Those apprehended are: Mohammed Sani- Adamu, Shuaibu Alhaji, Saidu Mahammadu and Adamu Jatau.
