Tobi made claim to a particular lady he should have married but refused to tie the knot with. He also said she was good-natured and homely. “Her name is Omotunde,” Tobi said. “I should have gotten married to her but I didn’t see the process through. Everybody knows about this in the family, even her sister as well.” Tobi quickly made a shoutout to Omotunde, saying he wished things went the way it should have. Anto, however was quick to warn him that people outside are crazy. “They sent me the handle of the person Lolu was involved with. They would have goggled this lady right now, even if it were as little as a nickname,” She said. Tobi had earlier on told Alex that he hated being pressured into a relationship.
