The National Chairman of Labour Party (LP), Dr. Mike Omotoso, has said the party will welcome Dr. Olusegun Mimiko back to its fold any time he returns. There are unconfirmed reports that Mimiko, a chieftain of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), is contemplating a return to LP. Mimiko won the Ondo State governorship election through the courts in 2009, displacing the late Dr. Olusegun Agagu, who won on PDPâ€™s platform. The former governor defected to PDP in 2014 before the end of his second tenure. PDP was defeated by All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2017 governorship election. In a statement in Abuja yesterday, Omotoso said LP would gain a mileage if Mimiko returned to its fold, adding that the ex- governor helped in building and nurturing the party.
