Transcorp Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Adim Jibunoh said the profit was largely as a result of increase in power generation by Transcorp Power Limited due to improved gas supply and increased generation capacity. According to him, capacity increased from 505 megawatts to 701 megawatts during the year as capacity increase was achieved through carefully planned maintenance programme for power generation assets and tactical engagement with stakeholders. He added that the group’s hospitality business remained resilient, posting stronger year-on-year performance as it continued to maintain market leadership with occupancy levels that were way ahead of competition. He pointed out that the group’s second hotel, Transcorp Hotel, Calabar continued its strong performance, achieving profitability for two consecutive years. “We are confident of improved fundamentals going forward, as we increase our available generation capacity to above 800 megawatts by year-end taking advantage of improving gas situation. We expect to benefit from the upside of the new improved infrastructure upon completion of our upgrade project in Transcorp Hilton Abuja. The upgrade project is currently on track,” Jibunoh said. Transcorp’s group strategic investments include power, hospitality, agribusiness and oil and gas sectors. The group’s notable businesses are Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja; Transcorp Hotels, Calabar; Transcorp Power Plc, Teragro Commodities Limitedand Transcorp Energy Limited.
