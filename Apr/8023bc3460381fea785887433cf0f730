The unexpected turnaround turned the fans at Stadio Olimpico into wild jubilation. Liverpool at Etihad Stadium completed their demolition of Manchester City, cruising to the semi-finals on 5-1 goal aggregate, after surviving a nightmarish first half, in which City scored their only goal in two minutes. The victory marked the first time since 2008 that Liverpool would qualify for the semi-final of the competition.
