To celebrate this year’s Workers’ Day, comedian Dr Smile will be organising a comedy show, ‘Dr Smile Unusual’, on May 1, at The Marquee, Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta, Ogun State. The season four of the comedy show, tagged ‘The Rebirth’, starts by 12pm and will be hosted by Tee A and Lepacious Bose. Comedians that will feature include Seyi Law, Gbenga Adeyinka, Honey Tongue, Teju Babyface, Woli Agba and Saco. Others are Mc Rapindaddy, Lafup, Woi Arole, Bash, Still Ringing, Dr Frick, Mc Baffy, Mc Bishop, Cris Lecturer and Mc Password. Also, musicians billed to perform include Jaywon, Adex, Artquake, Big Bolaji, Laykay Sax and Klever Jay. “This year will be very unusual cos the bill is heavy and I will be doing one hour performance on that day,” said Dr Smile, who sees Tee A, Owen Gee, Mc Abbey, Lepacious Bose and Gordons as his mentors. Speaking about how he got into comedy, Dr Smile, whose real name is Ogunleye Olamilekan, said: “It was my sister’s birthday party on the 23rd of April, 2004. The MC she invited didn’t show up. So, due to the fact that I talk a lot amidst friend they decided to push me to anchor the event which I did and it came out very well. After the event, I got another gig from her friend and others they say is history.”
