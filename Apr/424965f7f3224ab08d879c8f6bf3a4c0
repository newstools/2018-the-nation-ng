The National Assembly on Tuesday failed to pass the 2018 budget as promised. The leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives had promised that the 2018 budget would be passed by the two chambers on April 24. The promise was not to be following what a source called the refusal of heads of ministries, departments and agencies to appear for their budget defence. The source also said that the late appearance of some heads of MDAs to defend their budget proposals made subcommittees of both chambers to also submit their budget reports late to the Appropriation Committees. Findings showed that reports of subcommittees were still being collated by the Appropriation Committees for onward submission to the Senate and House in plenary for passage into law. The source who said that a lot of work still needed to be done on the submissions by subcommittees noted that “I am sure that the Appropriation Committees of the two chambers are working round the clock to effect their submissions.” With the failure to pass the budget on Tuesday, it is not clear the new date that would be chosen to clear the fiscal document. If the information that the two chambers of the National Assembly were not taking kindly to alleged onslaught on the parliament and its members by the Presidency is any thing to go by the passage of 2018 budget may further be delayed.
