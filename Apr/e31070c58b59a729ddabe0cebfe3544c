The Chief Judge (CJ) of Lagos State, Justice Opeyemi Oke, has urged journalists in the state to be professional and uphold the ethics of journalism while carrying out their duties. Oke made the call while addressing members of the National Association of Judiciary Correspondents (NAJUC), Lagos Chapter, on Friday in Lagos. She said journalists covering courts across the state must be highly professional and always have investigative minds in order to write good stories. The CJ emphasised that truth and fact must be the watch words for every journalist, noting that media practitioners who habitually turned in fake stories, were always labeled enemies of progress. “l encourage you all to practise investigative journalism; get facts in order not to send out false information to the public,’’ she advised. The chief judge promised to look into the challenges journalists faced in covering court proceedings in the state with a view to addressing them. “The courtroom is an open place that is accessible to the public. It is a place where you get information concerning the judicial process as well as watch proceedings,’’ Oke said. NAN
