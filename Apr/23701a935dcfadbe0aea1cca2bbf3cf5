The Sports Ministry Director, Federation of Elite Athletes Department (FEAD), Mrs Tayo Oreweme has come out stoutly to defend the performance of Team Nigeria in the just concluded 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games held in Australia, concluding that Nigeria’s contingent performed well in the sports fiesta. Several enthusiasts, including the Senate Committee on Sports and National body of Sports Writers Association of Nigeria, had faulted Nigeria’s performance at the Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, while accepting the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014 led by the then Director General of the defunct National Sports Commission Otunba Gbenga Elegbeleye, as the best ever, with 11gold, 11silver and 14 bronze medals won for Nigeria. But Oreweme disagreed, “For what the Lord has done, I am very grateful for that. We went to Glasgow, in Scotland with 126 athletes and we came back with 11 gold and this year in Australia, we went with 90 athletes and came back with 9 gold, by the time you calculate it, you will understand that 11 to 9, we have done better”, she defended. She, however, called on corporate bodies in Nigeria to wake up from their slumber and be alive to their Social Corporate Responsibilities. “I can’t count the number of sponsors that sponsored Australia, England, India and other participated countries.  If you look at their backdrop, I cannot count it, everything was done by sponsors. “The era of saying sports is not attractive, is a big joke, we should all know that youths have 60 percent of our population, this is something no one should be joking about, we should be involved in it, committed to it and sincerely give to it”, Oreweme disclosed to NationSport.
