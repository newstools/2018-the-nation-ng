The National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC ) has concluded plans to welcome at least 2,500 corps members to Lagos State for the 2018 Batch A orientation. The state Coordinator of NYSC, Mr Muhammed Momoh, made this known in an interview with the newsmen on Tuesday in Lagos. “The camp opens on April 19 and ends on May 12; the camp ground is ready; we have perfected arrangements with security agencies and community leaders to maintain security. “We expect to orientate 2,500 corps members within the period, and we will ensure that their welfare and security are not compromised,” he said. Momoh appealed the incoming corps members to be law-abiding and security-conscious. The newsmen reports that NYSC on Thursday presented Honours’ Award and cash prizes to 14 outstanding corps members who served in Lagos in the  2016 Batches ‘A’ and ‘B ‘ and 2017 Batch ‘A’, Stream I. The honour was bestowed on the corps members at their passing out ceremony at the NYSC Orientation Camp, Iyana-Ipaja. Momoh said at the occasion that 4,876 corps members successfully completed their service, adding that 23 would repeat their service for absconding from duty, and 17 would have their service extended.
