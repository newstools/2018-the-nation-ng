The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has said its ongoing onslaught against growing spate of traffic violations in the territory has yielded results with about 17,112 vehicles and 1,675  motor cycles  impounded for various traffic offences. Secretary of FCT Transportation Secretariat, Kayode Opeifa, who disclosed this yesterday in Abuja, said the Secretariat through its newly launched ” Operation Giraffe” has intensified surveillance on all the roads within the territory to restore sanity by enforcing compliance with all extant traffic rules. Opeifa said despite the efforts being made to sanitise the transportation system in the territory, recklessness and violations or regulation have remained the order of the day among motorists. He also stated that of all the vehicles operating in Abuja, only 220,000  were registered. He noted that office had given a directive to taxi drivers in the territory to upgrade their system and ensue compliance to the standards.  He explained that some of the innovation being introduced in the taxi system,  is to capture the biodata of the operators and the owners to ensure more security in the system. According to him, to manage the system more efficiently, a software has been developed to help traffic managers track all traffic offenders who damn the consequences and defiantly operate on the roads. ” We have developed a software that will help traffic managers within 30 seconds to know vehicles that are properly registered. Our new initiatives, operation giraffe is focusing more on vehicles that do not have Abuja registered number plate, because many of them were fake. ” We have also increased the number of traffic officers from 20 to 350, the FRSC has also deployed about 200 personnels to help in a daily traffic management,” he said.
