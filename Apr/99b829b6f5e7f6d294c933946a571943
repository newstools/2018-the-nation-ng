The Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Rt. Hon. Suraju Ishola Adekunbi, has said the socio-economic success of any nation is hinged on its ability to develop and explore the untapped potential of its youths. Adekunbi said this while participating in the March edition of the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) Abeokuta Children Zodiac party. He charged parents to lay good foundations for their wards, with good moral upbringing and parental care. According to him, there is need for parents and guardians to partner with government in giving quality education to their wards so as to prepare them for sound socio-political cum economic attainments in future with the ability to compete favourably with their peers across the globe. The Speaker said the monthly celebration was an avenue for kids to socialise, adding that the Senator Ibikunle Amosunâ€™s administration remained committed to ensuring the success of its free but qualitative education programme. The Speaker added that all hands are on deck by the governor and other stakeholders to ensure that the laudable programmes of the current administration will be continued beyond 2019. He added that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will ensure that the people of Ogun State are left in the hands of another team of capable administrators after the tenure of Senator Amosun in 2019. In their separate remarks, the General Manager, NTA Abeokuta, Mrs. Funmi Wakama, and the State Commandant, Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) , Mr. Philips Ayodele, advised the children to be studious, while making hard work, dedication and commitment their watchwords with a view to achieving excellence in their chosen careers.
