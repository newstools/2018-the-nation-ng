Coach Patience Igbiti has revealed the driving force behind Nigeria’s huge success in Special Sports at the ongoing Commonwealth Games and other international competitions. The country’s athletes swept the available four gold medals in Gold Coast and two silver medals with Lucy Ejike breaking her own world record in the process. Igbiti, a former Paralympian herself has been in charge of the national team alongside her compatriot Are Feyisetan. “In Nigeria, we ex-Paralympians adopted Para Lifting as our means of livelihood because we have no other thing to do. That’s our motivation” the jovial coach told NationSport in an exclusive interview at the Athletes’ Village in Gold Coast, Australia. On how his team rose to the occasion again at this Commonwealth, she said the lifters trained for only three months and yet made maximum impact. ‘We had only four gold medals available in the sport at the Commonwealth Games. We had only the three months to train and we made the best of the limited time at our disposal. “What helped us was that we’re working with the new world record during our training sessions. That’s the reason it was easy for one our lifters, Lucy Ejike to break her own record.” Igbiti gave kudos to former Paralympians like coach Are and herself for inspiring the country’s lifters to continue to put in their best even when the desired support does not come. ‘Success in Para Powerlifting in Nigeria can be attributed to the fact that ex-Paralympians are put in charge of the national team. Coach Are and I were great lifters in our active days having won laurels for Nigeria in different international competitions.
