The Red Card Movement launched last week in Abuja has reiterated the need to promote transparency and accountability in government. The group also kicked off its phase one programmes meant to  educate and sensitize citizens on their voting power adding that it will mobilize up to 30 million Nigerians to register to vote, about two million citizens with uncollected Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to collect them and for all citizens with PVCs to come out to vote and protect their votes. The group said it would publish data from both local and foreign organisations that reflect evidential failure of governance and corrupt leadership in the last two decades, third party evidence on the streets from citizens that show governance failure from huge infrastructural gap. Speaking at the event, the convener of the group and former Word Bank Vice President, Oby Ezekwesili stated the aim of the movement was to “remove our nation from the hands of bad governance and corrupt leadership.” She reiterated that the idea was to remove the decadent class and to place a quality set of leadership at all levels nationwide – people who have character, are competent and capable. “The key idea is that we wish to elevate the citizens’ awareness of their position and role in our politics and governance.” According to a co-convener and co-chair of Secretariat of the Movement, Tony Akabuno, the purpose of democracy is defeated if only a few people who are eligible to vote actually exercise their right to do so.  We understand that that there are many reasons for low citizens’ participation in elections and we are ready to encourage every eligible Nigerian citizen to register to vote,” she added. A key goal of The Red Card Movement is to increase the level of women and youth participation in the electoral process from 15 million to 62 million as well as target national legislative elections that are devoid of inducement and coercion.
