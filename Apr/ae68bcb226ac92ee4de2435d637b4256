The Appropriation Bill has been at committee level in the two chambers since its presentation following allegation that some Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) refused to defend their budgetary requests Saraki asked the Appropriation Committee to tidy up reports from sub-committees latest by Friday this week for submission to the Senate next week. He said: “The Chairman Appropriation should ensure that by Friday this week, collations of reports from various committees should end. “There should be no more extension for that purpose because the appropriation committee itself must submit its report to the Senate unfailingly next week.”
