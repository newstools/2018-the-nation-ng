Three suspected cultists have been arrested at Urhonigbe village in Orhionmwon local government area while robbing to raise money to secure bail for their leader identified as Emmanuel Osazuwa.  Emmanuel was arrested after he fought with some of the cult members over a Nokia phone.  It was at the station that the police identified him as a leader of the Eiye cult group.  After making several futile attempts to secure his release, his younger brother, Odion and two of his cult members, Stephen Ikpomwosa and Collins Osatohanmwen opted to rob with a view to using the proceed to release him.  They used the guns belonging to the confraternity to rob some girls of three phones and the sum of N350 before they were arrested.  Speaking at the police headquarters during a parade of criminals and kidnappers, Emmanuel said he didn’t asked his cult members to go and rob to bail him.  His words, “I was arrested for two fighting. We fought because of phones and police got us arrested. I didn’t send anybody to go and rob for me. I have never robbed in my life.  Stephen said they felt bad when their leader was arrested and kept in detention.  “When he was arrested, we were looking for money to bail him. We tried to raise money from among the members but we couldn’t raise much. We decided to use the gun belonging to the confraternity. We went to where some girls are and collected their phones and N350. I have not robbed before. I am just a hustler.  On the part of Collins, He said, “I have never robbed in my life. It was not our leader that sent us to go and rob. It was because he was arrested that we decided to rob and secure his bail. I feel so bad now.”  Police Commissioner, Babtunde Kokumo, said the suspects would soon be charged to court after investigation has been concluded.
