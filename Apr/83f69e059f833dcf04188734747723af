•No reversal no resumption, says NANS Ondo State government yesterday defended the fee increment at Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA). It said it inherited crisis in the institution, stressing the need for increment in tuition fee. Speaking through Information and Orientation Commissioner Yemi Olowolabi, the government denied that the increment was up 500 per cent. Olowolabi, who noted that the N30,000 fee paid by students was unrealistic, said the increment reflected the reality in the country. He said: “The governing council looked at the fee paid by students in the state-owned University of Science and Technology, which is between N120,000 and N150,000; University of Medical Sciences, Ondo (N350, 000 and N450,000); while students of Adekunle Ajasin University pay N30,000.” The commissioner said it was after the comparison that the government decided to carry out the increment. “For seven months before we came on board, salaries were not paid, accreditations were lost and no subvention paid to the institution. We met a crisis situation on ground. “It was after these that the governing council decided that what the students were paying as fees were unrealistic.” The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has ordered students not to pay the new fees. A statement by NANS’ JCC Chairman, Ondo branch, Adewumi Adebowale, described the increment as very high. He urged students not to resume academic activities scheduled for today, saying they should not pay the new fees. Authorities of AAUA had announced new school fees for categories of students. A statement by spokesman Sola Imoru said Faculties of Arts and Education fresh students are to pay N150,000, returning students, N120,000. In Faculties of Science, Agriculture, Social and Management Sciences, fresh students will pay N180,000, while returning students are to pay N150,000. Fresh students of Faculty of Law are to pay N200,000, while returning students will pay N150,000. Reactions have trailed the increment in the fees, which was just N30,000 before the latest decision. Students, parents and other stakeholders are not comfortable with the fees, describing it as outrageous. The management has announced resumption of students for 2017/2018 academic session. A statement by the Registrar, M.S Ayerun, said academic activities would begin for returning students from April 8 to 14, while fresh students are to resume on April 15.
