The Chairman, Senate Committee on Petroleum Resources (Upstream), Senator Tayo Alasoadura, has said unless security around the Senate is tightened, its invasion by hoodlums will persist. Alasoadura, who represents Ondo Central, addressed reporters after presenting a bus to the Students’ Union Government (SUG) of the Federal University of Technology, Akure (FUTA). Speaking yesterday, he said last week’s invasion of the Senate was disturbing, stressing that porous security aided the hoodlums in removing the mace. Alasoadura said such an incident would never happen in advanced nations. The lawmaker said: “We even learnt that the suspected hoodlums allegedly paid their way into the Senate. This shows the level of corruption in the country.” He noted that his colleagues have raised the alarm over weak security at the Senate. Alasoadura called for strict monitoring, to prevent a recurrence. He said the bus donation was to restore hope in leadership and a challenge to future leaders. The senator said: “I have always believed that in building a great nation, the youth must be equipped and positioned for leadership responsibilities.” He said the bus would aid their mobility and participation on campus, and others. Alasoadura said he raised motions and sponsored bills, such as Petroleum Industry Governance Bill and Adeyemi University of Education Bill, among others, which are importante to the country and Ondo Central. Vice Chancellor Adeola Fuwape hailed the lawmaker for the gesture, assuring him that the 25,000 students would support his present and future endeavours. The SUG President, Olaseinde Olayinka, appreciated the bus donation, saying it came at the appropriate time. He promised that his colleagues will back Alasoadura’s second term bid.
