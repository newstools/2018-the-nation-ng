A non-governmental organisation, Vision Spring Initiatives (VSI), has urged the government to improve access to safe sexual and reproductive health rights by removing legal restrictions. VSI Programme Assistant, Inisi Johnson, spoke in Lagos, during the launch of the campaign, ‘My Body, My Right’, as part of activities to commemorate the International Women’s Day. Johnson said the government must ensure that sexual and reproductive health services are safe and accessible to women. She urged the government to remove barriers and discrimination against adolescents in terms of access to sexual reproductive health, adding that various abuses faced by adolescent girls in the home and society should be addressed. “The government should ensure a broad range of providers are able to provide sexual and reproductive health rights information and services in a non-judgmental environment and at all levels for poor women and girls. Sexual and reproductive health right facilities should also be made available to girls in rural communities.” Executive Director, Community Human Right Foundation, Lateef Akinborade, added that those who were raped must come out to talk about it, noting that their interest would be protected. VSI Project Director, Ngozi Nwosu-Juba, urged parents and guardians to be vigilant on their young ones, noting that there was the need for sexuality education to be included in the school curriculum. According to her, sexuality education cannot kill; it only enables the child to know who he or she is. She added: “When someone is accused of rape, it should not be seen as a domestic issue. It should not go to the police station and be settled there. Offenders of rape should face the consequences of the offence.”
