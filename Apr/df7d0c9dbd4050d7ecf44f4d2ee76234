Former national team keeper, Austin Ejide made it clean sheet number 12 on Thursday as his club Hapoel Hadera drew 0-0 with Maccabi Ahi Nazareth. It was his 23rd appearance this season. Hapoel Hadera are second in the Israeli second division and occupy a promotion spot with four matches remaining in the season. Ejide is optimistic the team will gain promotion at the end of the season. “The (Maccabi Nazareth) draw wasn’t what we expected. They really made it difficult but we have to move on from there and focus on the remaining games. We will keep pushing till the end”, he told www.naijasportsgrill.com.ng. He added: “My mission here (Hadera) is to help the club return to the top flight and I will do my best. I am glad I kept a clean sheet. I hope to do more if that will take the club to the top. The fans are wonderful and deserve more”.
