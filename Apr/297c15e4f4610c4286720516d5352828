Years after its maiden edition was held, Total Television Studios, in partnership with Organseed International, has returned with the second edition of the Face of Nollywood (FON) Awards. Designed with the aim of discovering the most popular Nollywood personality, organisers of the awards which come up June 30 at Transcorp Hilton, Abuja, say the reward system stands out because movie lovers will get to pick the winners themselves. Already 162 popular acts, made up of veterans and newbies have been lined up for as contestants for the award. Among them are Richard Mofe Damijo (RMD), Patience Ozorkwo, Daniel K Daniel, Kate Henshaw, Genevieve Nnaji, Adeola Odunlade, Pete Edochie, Funke  Akindele, Halima Abubakar, and a host of others. Speaking at the unveil, which took place at Tivoli Gardens, Ikoyi, Lagos last Thursday, CEO of Total Television Studios, Ifeanyi Ikpoenyi said that the idea behind choosing a face, rather than several faces in several categories as is the case with other awards is what sets Face of Nollywood awards miles ahead of its closest competitor. “The idea is to discover someone who has a recognizable huge fan base, uncommon acting talent and a star personality that millions of Nigerians home and abroad as well as Africans can clearly identify with, display open admiration for and look up to for inspiration and hope. Such a personality does exist and may shock us all who he or she turns out to be.” According to the organisers, the voters will ultimately decide the choice for the current year. Candidates for the awards are selected randomly by a panel of award jurists. The overall winner will go home with N1 million, a plaque and a certificate of award while the first and second runners up will go home with N300, 000 and N250, 000 respectively. Organisers also revealed that the voting process will be handled online by Vas2nets while Ntel, TeGroup, Achievas, as well as Unda Group were listed among the sponsors.
