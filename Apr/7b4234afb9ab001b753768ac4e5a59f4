The Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) has said it is ready to chart a new course for the country. Niger State Chairman of the party, Abubakar Gwada, said this after its caucus and elders’ meeting in Minna, the Niger State capital. Gwada, in a statement, said the party had commenced mass mobilisation of Nigerians across the zones ahead of 2019 general elections. He said the party discussed extensively on the need to chart a new cause in order to face, head-on, the daunting challenges regarding the 2019 general elections. He said the party recently inaugurated its National Advisory Council (NAC) in Abuja as part of moves to wrestle power from the ruling All Progressives Congress in 2019 in the state. According to Gwada, who is also the party’s NAC Secretary, PDM has a new deal with Nigeria and Nigerians, and have learned humility by accommodating members from all ethnic and religious divides. He said membership registration for the Niger State chapter of the party has started in all the three geopolitical zones.
