Senate Deputy Minority Whip, Senator Biodun Olujimi, has expressed concern that the massive defections from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) might affect its chances in the July 14 governorship poll. Olujimi said it was sad that three former deputy governors, Chief Abiodun Aluko, Chief Adebisi Omoyeni and Dr. Sikiru Lawal, had left the party in the last one year over alleged dictatorship and imposition by Governor Ayo Fayose. The lawmaker representing Ekiti South in the National Assembly said her ambition on the PDP platform was intact, urging the party’s delegates to entrust her with the governorship ticket. She spoke at a news conference in Ikere-Ekiti after giving account of her stewardship and inaugurated projects in many towns and communities in her senatorial district. The federal legislator said she was still very much in the race for the PDP governorship ticket, saying she would fight on to the end to realise her ambition of becoming the first female governor in the Fountain of Knowledge. “It is worrisome that we are losing our prominent members. But I am a fighter, I will fight on until the right things are done in the PDP. Our national leaders promised to be up and doing otherwise they will take the blame for standing with their hands akimbo while this crisis lasted; this is not good.”
