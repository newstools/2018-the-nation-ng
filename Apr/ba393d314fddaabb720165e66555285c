Accident Investigation Bureau ( AIB ) on Wednesday attributed poor co- ordination between the two pilots that operated the ill – fated Associated Aviation October 3, 2013 as the cause of the crash saying the crew failed to implement principles of crew resource management. The AIB, while releasing the final accident report said the pilots should have aborted take – off the aircraft following indications from the aircraft that some components were not properly activated. Besides, the failings of the crew, it also fingered poor regulatory oversight duties by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA ) as another causal factor for the crash. Speaking yesterday at a briefing in Lagos , AIB , Commissioner and Chief Executive Officer, Akin Olateru apologized for the delay in the release of the accidents reports saying probe of  air accidents is not to indict any agency but to avoid reoccurrence. Olateru also fingered poor company as part of the cause of the crash. The Associated Aviation Embraer 120 aircraft with 20 passengers on board was conveying the remains of former Ondo State Governor, Chief Olusegun Agagu for burial in Akure. Besides, the Associated Aviation crash report, the AIB also released five final reports involving Bristow Helicopters , NCAT  trainer aircraft , Westlink Aviation and NAHCO loader and AeroContractors Aircraft . Olateru said since January 2017  the AIB, has released 16 accident reports.
