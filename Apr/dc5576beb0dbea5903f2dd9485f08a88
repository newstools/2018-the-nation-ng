The Regional Leaders Council (RLC) of Lagos State, last week said Governor Akinwunmi Ambode scored 100 percent in socio- economic sectors of the state. The group said this while conferring its prestigious Award and Certificate of “Praiseworthy Grassroots Governance Award” to the governor. They said it was in appreciation of the “quality leadership, delivery of dividend of democracy to the grassroots and the entire people of Lagos State.” The council consist of leaders and heads of Sarkin Hausa/Arewa Community, Sakin Fulani Community, Nupe North Central Community, Igbo Leader (Eze Ndigbo), and Mayor of South-south region in Lagos. The Award was received by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Civic Engagement, Benjamin Olabinjo at Alausa, Ikeja. RLC Leader and Eze Ndigbo of Ikeja, Uche Dimgba, said the Award represents the voice of all the regional groups in Lagos in their desire to work in unison to ensure that Ambode is returned for a second term. Dimgba noted that the award “is in line with rewarding good for good and sing praise of someone who is doing great work for his people.” Olabinjo enjoined the leaders to continue to ensure the peaceful co-habitation of the people in their respective communities, as the governor is working to make Lagosians happy by the provision of infrastructure that would make life comfortable for all and sundry in the State. He urged the leaders to mobilise their people to register with INEC and obtain their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) which is very important for participation in the coming elections.
