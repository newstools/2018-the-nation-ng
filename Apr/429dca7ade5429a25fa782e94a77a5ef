Bayelsa State government yesterday appealed to governing boards and councils of state-owned tertiary institutions to address concerns raised by labour unions in the implementation of the public sector reforms. Commissioner for Information and Orientation Daniel Iworiso-Markson, in a statement, said most requests directed at the government were within the jurisdiction of the governing boards. He said it was imperative that governing boards ensure a holistic implementation of the reforms in their schools. Iworiso-Markson recalled that the Miyebo-led Committee met with the boards and councils where agreements were reached on issues, including a decision on workforce. He said the outcome compelled the government to commit N630 million as subvention to the six institutions. “In  those meetings, a decision was reached with a policy of placing the institutions on subvention as is the norm, especially as it relates to government funding of institutions. “The government spends  N630 million on them, as follows: NDU N350 million; Isaac Jasper Boro College of Education N100 million; College of Health Technology, Otougidi N40 million; The Polytechnic, Aleibiri N50 million; University of Africa N75 million; and International Tourism Institute N15 million.” Iworiso-Markson advised union leaders to be wary of disgruntled politicians on a mission to destabilise the polity. He called their attention  to mischief-makers, who plan to incite the public against government through labour leaders. The commissioner enjoined union members to adhere to rules guiding operations of the public service by “exploring proper channels to seek redress rather than resort to media interviews  with the intent to blackmail and incite the public against government.’’
