All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Ekiti State Mr. Isola Fapohunda has said his motive is not primitive accumulation. He said he joined the race to make an impact through diligent service. Fapohunda said those seeking to enrich themselves have no business in politics. He said Ekiti would need a governor who will humble himself as a “servant of the people and not a Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Governor,” who looks down on the people. Fapohunda, a lawyer, said leadership goes beyond the construction of buildings and structures, stressing that investing in the people and boosting their standard of living should be the priorities. Speaking at an interactive session with reporters in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, Fapohunda promised to run a people-oriented government. He said: “It is not going to be a government in which one man will be dictating to the people. We need to upgrade Ekiti to a state that will be envy of others. “My dream is to take Ekiti to where it should be, I don’t need we need a CEO governor. We need somebody who understands their feeling and ready to meet their needs.” He urged the leadership of the APC to organise a credible and transparent primary to enhance the party’s chances of winning the July 14 election.
