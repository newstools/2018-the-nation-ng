French President Emmanuel Macron has used his speech to the joint houses of the United States Congress to denounce nationalism and isolationism. Mr. Macron said such policies were a threat to global prosperity, the BBC reports. The speech was widely interpreted as a thinly veiled attack on U.S President, Donald Trump’s America First agenda. Mr. Macron also raised differences on global trade, Iran and the environment, seemingly in contrast to the warm bonhomie of his visit so far. The French president was given a three-minute standing ovation as he took his place in the chamber for his speech. He hailed the “unbreakable bonds” of the U.S and France, forged in “liberty, tolerance and equal rights.” He has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, and is in Washington as the first foreign leader to be afforded a U.S state visit by the Trump White House.
