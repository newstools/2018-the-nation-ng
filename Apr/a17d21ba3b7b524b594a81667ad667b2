Abia State Patent and Proprietary Medicine Dealers Association (APPAMDA) has urged the government to assist it in building the Wholesale Drug Control Centre (WDCC). The Federal Government gave drug dealers till next January to complete the WDCC and move into the facility or face sanction. Its Chairman Chukwuemeka Osuagwu told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Aba the association was unable to pay for the land. He noted that they need to pay the owner before construction can start. Osuagwu feared that with eight months left, they may be unable to meet the deadline. “The developers sent by the Federal Government have written to us that they are ready to come and collect the survey plan and start work. “We replied that they should be patient with us; this is to allow us time to reach an understanding with the owner of the land before we start work. “We don’t want people to see us as being lawless. So the right thing must be done,” he said. The chairman said the association had a pending leadership matter in court that had affected the response of members towards contributing to the project. He said since the matter had been decided by a state High Court in favour of his team, the process of collecting money would improve.
