Despite his successful knee surgery on Tuesday, Argentina Football Association doctor, Homero D’agostino is worried over the full fitness of Sergio Aguero for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. According to D’agostino, the recovery for the surgery doesn’t take less than five weeks. The doctor told Radio 10, “That a player gets Arthroscopic surgery 60 days before the World Cup is worrying. The recovery demands no less than five weeks.” A hopeful father of the Manchester City’s striker told Radio La Red, “I spoke to him and he’s doing well. It was an emergency surgery. He’ll be out for a month. He got operated on to get to the World Cup without problems. He told me that in 20 days he’d be back in training. I don’t know if he’ll play a match with City.”
