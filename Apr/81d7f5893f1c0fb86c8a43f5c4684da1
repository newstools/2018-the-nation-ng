Nigeria international Alex Iwobi was a non-playing substitute as Arsenal were held to a 1-1 draw by Atlético Madrid in the first leg of their UEFA Europa League semifinal game at the Emirates Stadium. The Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has come under fire from the fans for his failure to introduce any substitutes for the entirety of the game, especially as they had a man advantage following the dismissal of Sime Vrsaljko as early as the tenth minute. Apart from Iwobi, the other outfield players named on the bench include Rob Holding, Calum Chambers, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Sead Kolasinac and Edward Nketiah. Here are some of the Tweets from disappointed Arsenal fans: @theEpicGooner : ”We played a semi final in Europe and Arsenal Football Club didn’t have a player who can come on as a substitute. Shambolic.” @esamedin_akod : ”Thank God he is leaving, can he explain why he didn’t use his substitute?”. @51mon_muh1nda : ”Welbeck n Wilshere were clearly worn out. What do we have substitutes for? I just don’t understand… Sack Wenger already”. @igweindahouz : ” it is obvious that Arsene Wenger has no ambition and it is why we are where we are in the scheme of things in Europe! A player down and you couldn’t take advantage of the number! 90 minutes and you couldn’t substitute tired legs like Welbeck and Lacazette!”. @MarkSteveKE : ”No substitutes @Arsenal and you expect to win…”. @charlesy55 : ”0 substitutes used. Against 10 players.” @Ramoo_Sg :WingerOut Now Please and please no substitute why”. ?@Afcfancs22 : ”Why didn’t #Arsenal substitute anyone? I think Nketiah would have been effective. Why??”. Despite his well-documented injury problems, the former Inter Milan starlet is having a banner season, with five goals in 22 appearances in the Serie A, his best ever goals tally since he turned professional.
