Retired Nigeria international Michael Emenalo is being linked with the job of AC Milan Director for Football. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, Emenalo, Walter Sabatini, Cristiano Giuntoli, Ariedo Braida and Andrea Berta are in the running to take over from Massimiliano Mirabelli. Speculation is rife that Massimiliano Mirabelli will be dismissed after Milan failed to qualify for next season’s UEFA Champions League, with 13 points separating the Rossoneri from fourth-placed Lazio and only four games to the end of the season. It appears Walter Sabatini is in pole position for this job as the leadership of Milan has already held talks with the former director of football at Lazio, Palermo, Roma, Inter Milan and Jiangsu Suning. Emenalo resigned from his position as Chelsea’s technical director in November 2017, before he took over a similar role at Monaco three weeks later. The respected talent sporting expert made three appearances for the Super Eagles at the 1994 World Cup, against Argentina, Greece and Italy.
