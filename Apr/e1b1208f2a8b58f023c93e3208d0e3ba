The Lagos State Commissioner for Environment, Babatunde Durosimi -Et:ti, has said that science and technology play a critical role in any nation’s development and her economic prosperity. To ignore Science, he said, is to ignore development. He spoke at the 52nd Annual Conference of the Science Association of Nigeria (SAN), at Adeyemi Bero Hall in Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos. “In the 21st century, developments in science and technology are fundamentally altering the way people live, connect, communicate, and transact business with profound effects on economic development. Technological and scientific revolutions underpin economic advances, improvements in health systems, education and infrastructure,” the commissioner said. He noted that access to, and application of science and technology are differentiators between nations that are able to tackle poverty effectively by growing and developing their economies, and those that are not able to. “The extent to which developing economies emerge as economic powerhouses depends on their ability to grasp and apply insights from scientific innovations. As an engine of growth, the potential of science is endless, and still untapped in Africa. This is why we strongly believe that this conference will create an interface between policymakers and science practitioners which would help in bringing the gap and assist in tapping into the wealth of scientific knowledge available in the nation and across the globe.”
