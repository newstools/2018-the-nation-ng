Residents of four Lagos communities stormed the Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday to challenge excessive billing. They prayed the court to declare the alleged estimated billing by the Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EEDC) as illegal. The claimants said EEDC’s failure to provide them with pre-paid meters has resulted in arbitrary and excessive billing, adding that those who refused to pay are disconnected and forced to pay reconnection fees. They alleged extortion and daylight robbery by EEDC. They also claimed that oral and written complaints made at the company’s head office were not acknowledged. The communities are praying for an order directing EEDC to distribute pre-paid meter to all of them, as well as an order of perpetual injunction restraining the firm from issuing bills to any consumer in the communities without prepaid meter. The protesters, numbering over 300, besieged the court’s premises at about 7:30 a.m. for the hearing of suit filed on their behalf by a rights activist, Mr. Segun Ogunsanya. The affected communities are Alaba-Oro, Mosafejo Amukoko, Abule Kere and Olaniyonu. The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) is joined as defendant in the suit.
