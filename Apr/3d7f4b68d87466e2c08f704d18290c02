The Real Madrid Foundation Soccer Clinic resumes today at the Campos Mini Stadium, Lagos. About 300 participants were given certificate last week Friday with Real Madrid Academy coaches – Daniel Rotella and Rodrigo Rubles – expected to work with new sets of kids this week. The youngsters made up of boys and girls were presented with the certificates after successfully attending the clinic. The local coaches who took part were not left out as they were also certified. One of the Project Managers for SPR Luxury Limited, Kayode Bawa-Allah stated that the kids showed exemplary character and earned their certificates for the good jobs they did. “I must commend the kids and coaches for the passion they showed towards learning new football skills and technique. “The coaches from Madrid were equally happy with the way the kids acquainted themselves with what they were taught. It is good to also see that the players turned out  on large numbers,” Bawa-Allah added. One of the coaches, Christian Ebikade stated that it is a dream to be part of the clinic where he has learnt a lot from the two coaches that came from Spain. An elated kid, Joseph Shaka commended SPR Luxury Limited for bringing the clinic to Nigeria and urged organizers to do more for the Nigerian kids.
