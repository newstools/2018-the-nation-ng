Nigeria weightlifter, Fatima Yusuf suffered a cruel fate at the ongoing Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia yesterday following her disqualification from the weightlifting event. Yusuf who was scheduled to start from the 74 kg had her wears torn at the foot of the stage just as she was about making her first attempt. While her coach was making frantic efforts to mend it, the mandatory six seconds elapsed and she was timed out by the announcer. In defiant mood, Yusuf still went ahead to lift after judge announced ‘no lift’. She then went angrily and came back to make attempts at 77kg. She failed to lift the bar twice.
