Some consultant psychiatrists have called on stakeholders in the health sector to improve the quality of safe deliveries, pregnancies and immunisation to prevent disorders like autism in children. They spoke yesterday in Lagos at a seminar organised by the Federal Neuro-Psychiatric Hospital, Oshodi Annex, in commemoration of the 11th World Autism Awareness Month marked annually in April. Its theme was: “Taking Care of the Individual and the Family.“ According to an online health information, MedlinePlus, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person’s life. “It affects how a person acts and interacts with others, communicates, and learns. It includes what used to be known as Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders. “It is called a “spectrum” disorder because people with ASD can have a range of symptoms. “People with ASD might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them. They may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviours.’’ In her remarks, a consultant psychiatrist, Dr Grace Ijarogbe, said that there was need to improve the quality of safe deliveries, pregnancies and immunisation to prevent disorders like autism in children. The Medical Director of the hospital, Dr Oluyemisi Ogun, said children with ASD should be included in the activities of the community.
