The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Friday directed its members in Kogi State to vote against the recall of Senator Dino Melaye during Saturday’s verification of petitioners’ signatures. The PDP said in a statement in Lokoja it was not in support of Melaye’s recall from the beginning. The party’s Director of Research and Documentation, Mr. Dickson Achadu, who signed the statement, described the attempt to recall Melaye as a product of internal crisis in the All Progressives Congress (APC). He, therefore, urged his party members to distance themselves from the exercise. However, the party said it was in support of the senator’s agitation for good welfare for workers and the downtrodden, adding that the state had been made a laughing stock. It urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to guard against being used in the plan to forcefully deny Kogi West quality representation at the Senate. The party urged its members to remain peaceful and law-abiding but refrain from submitting to intimidation and inducement by the sponsors of the recall. However, the state Police Command has assured the people of Kogi West senatorial district that the exercise would be peaceful and violence-free. The state Police Commissioner, Mr. Ali Janga, in a statement, urged them to cooperate with the security agencies to ensure that criminal elements do not hijack the process. Janga warned political thugs as well as those who do not have business at the polling units to stay away.
