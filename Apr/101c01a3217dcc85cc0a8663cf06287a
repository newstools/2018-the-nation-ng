IT is no news that Aisha Babangida has encountered myriad of numbing defeats especially on the love front, but she has refused to be defeated or allow the strife and storms of life define her otherwise enviable life. Married in her youth to Basheer Nalado Garba, a relative of the Sani Abachas, the marriage went sour after three years over accusations of intolerance and arrogance. In 2008, she found succour in the then Zamfara State governor, Alhaji Aliyu Shinkafi, who, at the time, already had two wives. Under the wings of Shinkafi, Aisha seemed to flourish and it seemed only death would do them part. However, constant confrontations from Shinkafi’s older wives and a failed re-election bid put the union asunder. Incidentally, her parents, Ibrahim and Maryam, were the epitome of an enduring marriage. They got married in 1969 and remained together till death took the former first lady in 2009. The former military president has refused to remarry despite multiple speculations to that effect. Today, Aisha is single but doesn’t wear her status on her sleeves. You would not miss her glow and grace as she steps out whenever occasion demands. Aisha was among the women at the wedding rites of Fatima Dangote in Kano. She concentrates her energy on her Better life for Rural Women, a women empowerment organisation she inherited from her late mom, as well as promoting girl-child education.
