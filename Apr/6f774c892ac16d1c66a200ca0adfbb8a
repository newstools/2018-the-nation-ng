The Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, Chief Gani Adams, has given reasons why he celebrates his birthday every year. Addressing reporters at his Omole Phase II, Lagos, home at the weekend, he said the annual event was to appreciate God’ s blessings in his life. He said: “Monday, April 30, is my birthday. I will turn 48. It is my usual tradition to celebrate it in a big way. “I often tell people that each year, I celebrate my birthday to receive more blessings from God. Over the years, God has been so good to me and my family. “I can’t thank God enough for the blessings I receive from him annually. I always have reasons to celebrate my birthday. This is why I invite people across the world to celebrate with me.” Adams said the birthday party had become his annual ritual, adding that it was good to appreciate God. He said he would use the event to host his admirers. Dignitaries expected at this year’s event include traditional rulers from the Southwest, governors, top businessmen and women, members of the National Coordinating Council of Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), members of Oodua Progressive Union (OPU) in 82 countries and politicians. Adams is the 15th Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland. He is the National Coordinator of OPC, Global Convener of OPU and Chief Promoter of Olokun Festival Foundation. This year’s edition of his birthday holds tomorrow at Martino’s Hotel, Jobi Fele Way, opposite Corporate Affairs Commission, Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos, from 12pm.
