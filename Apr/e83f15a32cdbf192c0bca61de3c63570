The Olufaki of Ifaki-Ekiti, Oba Gabriel Oluwole Agbaje, has called on the state government and security agencies to save his community from incessant bank robbery. Oba Agbaje made the call on Friday while speaking with The Nation on the attack on an old generation bank by daredevil armed robbers who held the town hostage for about thirty minutes. Social and commercial activities were at low ebb as residents gathered in groups discussing the robbery incident. The robbers arrived the bank premises at about 3.56 pm on Thursday amidst heavy shooting which sent panic round the town. The monarch noted that the latest attack was the fourth time men of the underworld would attack the bank, the only financial institution in the community. He said: “I was in the palace during the attack and we were hearing heavy gunfire and we saw smoke billowing into the sky. It happened at a time the Olufaki-in-Council were about to meet. “My subjects are not happy with what happened; in fact, in one of the attacks on the bank in the past, a priest was shot dead. “This is one attack, too many; we are calling for the assistance of our government to save us from robbers. We want them to assist us to strengthen security in Ifaki. “It is unfortunate that a policeman was killed, the attack happened in daylight when nobody expected it. Our traditional hunters and OPC men usually patrol in the night but this attack happened in the day.
