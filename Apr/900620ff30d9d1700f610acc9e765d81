Fast-rising comedian, Akinbode Gabriel, popularly known as Ogbenigabu has urged his fellow young comedians to stick to their originality and stop lobbying for shows. According to the comedian who carved a niche for himself by spinning comedy skits and songs on Instagram; “Every young comedian needs to work hard and be discipline as a professional for them to realise their potentials. This is an entertainment industry unlike other type of industry where comedy currently has no association that checks or regulates its activities. “I don’t see myself as upcoming comedian because we can’t have upcoming pilot or surgeon. So, I see myself as a comedian and not upcoming. Once you are destined to rise to the top it will surely end in praise. As a comedian you need to relate with certain people and get familiarize yourself with being funny and being offensive to people.” In 2012, Ogbenigabu got his first performance on campus show. And performed in various show including,  ‘Laff Out Loud with Seyi Law’, Laffmataz with Gbenga Adeyinka, Lafup Live, Koye Live, Jokes Apart, Like Seriously with Mc Laff amongst others. He is currently host a comedy hangout at Klub Bugaloe in Lugbe, Abuja every Wednesday. Ogbenigabu, a graduate of mathematics from Bowen University, Iwo said he learnt comedy from Peteru and his role models are Alibaba and Steve Harvey. Recently, he posted a video of himself with the comedic prophet, Wooli Arole on instagram in a #Ojoade remix of Science Students by Olamide. The video was received with lots of likes and views on Instagram both on his page and Arole’s page.
