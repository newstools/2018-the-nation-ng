The Forum of All Progressives Congress (APC) Non-NWC members yesterday made a U-turn on its support for tenure extension for members of the National Working Committee (NWC). It is now supporting President Muhammadu Buhari’s stand that tenure elongation is undemocratic. The group also dismissed reports that some governors were planning to use state chairmen to extend the NWC’s tenure. The Forum was one of the groups that first publicly canvassed tenure elongation for the NWC. Its spokesman, Jock Alamba, told a news conference in Abuja that after due consultation with stakeholders: “We the Forum of All Progressives Congress (APC) Non-NWC members wish to state clearly and unambiguously that we stand with our dear President Buhari  on his position that election to party offices, starting from ward, local government and state congresses to national convention be conducted unencumbered, with free and fair elections. “We share Mr President’s unalloyed commitment to the rule of law and fine tenets of internal democracy and the firm beacons he is laying to deepen our fledgling democracy. “He has, at different fora, as a converted democrat demonstrated his commitment to democracy as exemplified in the gubernatorial and senatorial elections which opposition political parties won in states like Anambra and Rivers under his watch which is a stark difference from mid-term and other election results under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 16 years of do or die politics. “President Buhari’s concern for due process is legendary and we could not underrate his concern that since the law is an ass, our most likely 2019 presidential and other electoral victories should not be toyed with or placed in jeopardy with legal niceties or put in harm’s way of fortune hunters.
