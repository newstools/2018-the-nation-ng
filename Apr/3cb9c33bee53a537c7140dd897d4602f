Organisers of the Lagos International Jazz Festival (LIJF) have announced that this year’s celebration will be held in memory of the late South African Jazz legend, Hugh Masekela who recently passed on. Scheduled to hold on Monday, April 30 which is globally recognized as International Jazz Day, the one day multistage event takes place at the arts and culture hotspot, Freedom Park in the heart of Lagos. Speaking on this year’s ceremony, LIJF founder and festival director, Ayoola Sadare said; “it’s with great pleasure that on our 10th anniversary we are able to honor the memory of the late legendary international icon, cultural statesman & father of South African Jazz Hugh Maleeka on the LIJF platform though post mortem. Bra Hugh was an inspiration to the Jazz community locally and globally, though he never performed on the LIJF stage we believe we owe him a duty to be celebrated for his long and positively impactful life through his music. Hugh Masekela’s spirit lives on through his music which will be with us for a long time.” The maiden edition of the Lagos International Jazz Festival (LIJF) took place in 2008 at Studio 868 in Victoria Island. It was headlined by South Africa’s Award winning Freshly Ground & UK’s Courtney Pine. The Annual Lagos International Jazz Festival organized by Inspiro productions is part of the Lagos Tourism Arts & Culture Calendar and is supported by the Lagos State Government & Lagos Tourism amongst others.
