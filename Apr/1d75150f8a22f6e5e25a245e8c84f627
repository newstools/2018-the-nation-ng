The Kaduna Polytechnic ( Kadpoly ) chapter of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic ( ASUP ) has said that there is no plot to unseat the Rector of the institution, Professor Idris Bugaje; saying the union only gave the management a 21 working days ultimatum to meet its demands. Reacting to an online publication which says the Union was planning to remove the Rector of the institution, the spokesperson of the union, Abbas Muhammad explained that the Union’s Congress of April 17, 2018 only gave the management a 21 working days ultimatum to meet it’s demands for improved welfare. “There was never a time when removal of the Rector was contemplated. The claim by the publication that the issue has divided the union is false and baseless. ASUP Kadpoly under the leadership of Dr. Aliyu Hassan Ibrahim is intact and on same page on the need to work with the management to turn around the fortunes of the Polytechnic and any theory of division is just an imagination of some few individuals who are not comfortable with the peace witnessed in the institution,” The union therefore called on the general public to disregard the false publication which be described as an attempt to cause industrial disharmony in the polytechnic and create a rift between the Union and the management. The chairman of the union, Dr. Aliyu H. Ibrahim also reiterated that there was never an attempt to remove Professor Bugaje, saying, “All we are demanding is purely improved welfare for our members,” he said.
