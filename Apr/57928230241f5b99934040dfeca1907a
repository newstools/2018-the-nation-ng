Robbers yesterday attacked a first generation bank at Ifaki-Ekiti in Ido/Osi Local Government of Ekiti State. One policeman was killed. Another was injured. He has been hospitalised. The incident occurred barely two weeks after a similar attack on five banks in Offa, Kwara State. Over 30 people died in the robbery. An eyewitness told The Nation that the incident happened about 4pm. The robbers, whose number could not be ascertained last night, destroyed the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) gallery. Activities were paralysed for about 30 minutes, as residents fled. Human and vehicular traffic on Ifaki-Ado Road, Ifaki-Ido Road and Ifaki-Oye-Omuo Road were affected. Police Commissioner Abdullahi Chafe, who confirmed the incident, refused to give details. He said: “I cannot give you details now because we are in a meeting. We will give details in due course.”
