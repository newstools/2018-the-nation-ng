Oyo State government has approved beaded crowns and coronets for 48 monarchs. The beneficiaries are the crowned 21 Ibadan obas, and traditional rulers and chiefs elsewhere. The new law provides an alternative legal validation and cover for the controversial elevation of the 21 Ibadan obas. A state High Court nullified their coronation, based on recommendation of a judicial panel last August. Information, Culture and Tourism Commissioner Toye Arulogun said the decision was taken after consultation with the Council of Obas and Chiefs. He said the approval was in line with powers conferred on the governor by Section 28(1) of the Chiefs Law Cap 28, Vol. 1 Laws of Oyo State of Nigeria. The commissioner stressing that the approval had been gazetted by Oyo State Notice No. 20-67 of Oyo State of Nigeria Gazette No. 3, Vol. 43, published on March 29 and endorsed by Secretary to the State Government Ishmael Olalekan Alli. Arulogun said 26 monarchs would wear beaded crown based on the approval, while 22 would wear coronets. He said over 100 applications were received for beaded crowns. The commissioner said the consultative meeting was attended by 23 monarchs and chiefs, led by the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi, adding that three of the rulers could not attend due to old age. He said the other three did not attend for different reasons. The spokesman said the meeting stepped down approval for six chiefs, promising further approvals later. Arulogun said beaded crowns were approved for the Alajaawa of Ajaawa in Ogo-Oluwa Local Government, the Aale of Okeâ€™Lerin in Ogbomoso North Local Government, the Onijabata of Jabata in Surulere Local Government, the Onigbeti of Igbeti in Olorunsogo Local Government, the Ajoriiwin of Irawo in Atisbo Local Government, the Asawo of Ayete in Ibarapa North Local Government, the Obalufon of Sepeteri in Saki East Local Government and the trio of the Oluigbo of Igbojaye, the Olokaka of Okaka and the Eleyinpo of Ipapo in Itesiwaju Local Government.
