Lafarge Africa Plc, has completed a two-day two Safety Awareness training programmes for over 70 employees of Brains & Hammers Limited and TEC Engineering Company (Nigeria) Limited, both in Kano. The health and safety training programmes are part of a broader commitment Lafarge Africa makes with its partners and customers to enable them improve the safety standards and practices on their sites. Speaking about the sessions, the Director for Health & Safety at Lafarge Africa Plc, Graeme Bride, said: “Lafarge is committed to positively impacting the construction industry in Nigeria and we are always willing to share our rich and global experience in health and safety with our customers and partners. Our goal is ultimately to conduct our business with zero harm to people and create a healthy and safe environment for our clients and employees.” One of the firms whose staffs were involved in the training exercise, Brains & Hammers Limited, is involved in the construction sector in Kano State and is currently building over fifteen 15,000 units of shops and offices across a land mass of about 1,370 meters by 1063 meters. On the other hand, TEC Engineering Company (Nigeria) Limited TEC- is currently building a five kilometer fly over in Kano, including culverts, roads and two kilometer bridges in Adamawa state. In acknowledging the impact of the training, participants from both firms expressed appreciation for the exercise, noting it to be a welcome development and an added value they’ve received from partnering with Lafarge. The training sessions were aimed at improving the safety standards and practices in these construction companies and on their project sites.
