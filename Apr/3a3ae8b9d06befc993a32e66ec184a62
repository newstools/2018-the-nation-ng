In order to further technological development in the education sector and among the next generation, Vodacom Business Nigeria has organised a robotics training session for thirty-six young students from the S.S. Peter & Paul Nursery and Primary School. Loving Gaze, an independent non-profit organisation that serves the underprivileged communities in Lagos State, runs the school.  The young students, aged between 8 and 10, through a practical course on robotics, were given the opportunity to learn about the integration of the Internet of things (IoT) in robotics and its growing relevance in various areas of modern life. The students were taught how to build, programme and control robots, drones and other artificial intelligence. This demonstrated the essential nature of technology in various aspects of everyday life, including securing lives and properties. As a practical demonstration of this, students were shown how drones could be used for a wide range of services in today’s world. This includes the delivery of medication and lifesaving supplies to remote locations in emergency situations, which is already happening in some locations around the world. They were also given a tour of the company’s facilities, exposing them to the importance of connectivity and telecommunications technology in today’s digital world.
