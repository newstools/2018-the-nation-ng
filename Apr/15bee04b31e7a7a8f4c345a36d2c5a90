Ahead of the coming governorship election in Ekiti State and the 2019 general election, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has revived the State Implementation Committee on Voters’ Education and Publicity (SICVEP). It said this is part of efforts at ensuring free, fair, credible, acceptable and conclusive elections. The committee is made up of representatives of the Federal Ministry of Information, state Ministry of Information, the Ekiti State Office of the National Orientation Agency, Ministry of Women Affairs, the state government owned Broadcasting Service of Ekiti State and the state Council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ). Speaking at the inaugural meeting of the revived committee in Ado Ekiti, the Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Abdul-Ganiyu Olayinka Raji, stressed the importance of passing accurate information on guidelines for the ongoing voters’ registration and other relevant voters’ education towards ensuring the success of the governorship election this year and the general election next year. The REC, who spoke through the Administrative Secretary of the Commission in the state, Dr. Omoleke Muslim, expressed satisfaction with the progress made in the voters’ registration exercise, noting that the number of the newly registered voters had exceeded the number recorded in the previous exercise by over 20 per cent. He listed the activities lined up for the committee in preparation for the elections to include organising implementation meetings with relevant stakeholders, voters’ education exercise at the grassroots level as well as production and distribution of information, education and communication materials.
