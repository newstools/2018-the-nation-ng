An Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) operative, Usman Zakari, told the Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday that the Commission does not have a torture chamber. He was testifying in a trial- within -trial to determine whether statements made by former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, Ms Jumoke Akinjide, and her co-accused were voluntary. Akinjide disowned five extrajudicial statements which she allegedly made at the EFCC. The other defendants including former Senator representing Oyo Central Senatorial District, Ayo Adeseun, and a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) leader in Oyo State, Chief Olarenwaju Otiti, also claimed they did not make their statements voluntarily. Akinjide’s lawyer, Mr. Olusegun Williams, had opposed moves by EFCC’s counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo to tender the statements in evidence on the basis that they were obtained under duress. EFCC accused the defendants of conspiring to directly take possession of N650million from former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke, which they reasonably ought to have known was part of proceeds of an unlawful act, and without going through a financial institution. Justice Muslim Hassan had ordered a trial –within- trial to determine if the statements were made voluntarily. Led in evidence by prosecuting counsel, Nnaemeka Omenwa, who stood in for Oyedepo on Monday, Zakari, who heads the Commission’s Special Task Force 4, said the defendants were not forced to make a statement. He said when Adeseun reported at the Commission on May 11, 2016, he agreed to make a statement only in his lawyer’s presence. “We had to wait for his lawyer to come before he made statements. The following day, the second defendant made a statement voluntarily in the presence of his lawyer,” he said.
