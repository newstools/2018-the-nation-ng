With the 2019 general elections drawing closer, Enough Is Enough Nigeria, a non-profit organisation is set to hold a fundraiser event on Sunday, April 15. Scheduled for Harbour Point, Victoria Island, Lagos from 6pm to 10pm, the event, tagged ‘Light A Candle’ is expected to drive discussion on voter education and awareness as well as reiterate EiE’s RSVP message; Register, Select Credible Candidates, Vote not fight, Protect your votes. The event will also present the organisation’s activities for the next four years. According to the organisers, the ‘Light A Candle’ fundraiser will raise money for electoral programmes by auctioning items and time with Nigeria’s best and brightest including, 2Baba, Banky W, Oby Ezekwesili, The Ighodalos, Tunde Bakare, Lanre Olusola, Ibukun Awosika, The Adeyemis, Aisha Oyebode, Tonye Cole and other celebrities. The theme, Light A Candle is derived from W.L Watkinson’s phrase: “Yet is it far better to light the candle than to curse the darkness” to remind Nigerians to take action and complain less. Executive Director of EiE Nigeria, Yemi Adamolekun, stated that “the phrase is at the heart of our work to educate citizens on their rights and responsibilities, so that we move from ranting to acting and occupy the “Office of the Citizen” the highest office in the land.” In the past 8 years, EiE Nigeria has led youth-focused campaigns, mobilising the electorates to ask the right questions and make informed decisions during and after the electoral process. Interested bidders can make their offers on EiE Nigeria’s live ‘Light A Candle’ website.
