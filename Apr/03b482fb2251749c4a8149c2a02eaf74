A former Comptroller General of the Nigeria Customs Service, Abdullahi Inde Dikko, has faulted his inclusion in the list of alleged looters released by the Federal Government. Dikko denied his alleged involvement in the looting of N40billion as claimed by Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed. In a statement released on his behalf by a group – Committee of Concerned Customs Officers (CCCO) – Dikko said he served without blemish and retired voluntarily in 2015. The group is led by Assistant Comptroller of Customs, Jonah Amache. He said with the automation of the Customs revenue collection process, it was impossible for anyone to divert the Service revenue under any guise. The statement reads: “With the reforms Dikko introduced, the process of revenue collection is now water-tight and absolutely shielded from manipulation and unauthorised access by anybody, no matter how highly placed. “All import and excise duties are paid to commercial banks and it is compulsory that the money be remitted to the Federation Account at 6 o’ clock everyday of business and every morning. “All the money collected resides at the Central Bank of Nigeria. The Comptroller-General is never a signatory to any account. The money allocated to Customs was not without control. “All projects strictly followed due process. The Comptroller-General had his expenditure and approval limits, and reported to the Board of Customs and Excise and also the Federal Executive Council. “As a non-partisan professional, even in retirement, Dikko remains unflinching in his loyalty to Nigeria and the institutions of government. “He has never betrayed his family, the Customs, as an institution, and the government and people of Nigeria for the privilege given him to contribute his quota towards the development of critical agency as the NCS.”
