It is no news that Lagos is constantly bedeviled with chronic gridlocks ( traffic ) in our major roads. This sorry traffic situation may further be aggravated if solutions are not urgently proffered, especially with our ever increasing population. Many states in Nigeria are also faced and fazed with the myriad traffic problems which seems to constantly flout various remedial measure adopted by different governments over the years – Lagos is no exception. Areas like Mushin, Iyana-Ipaja and other urban areas where motorcycles ply frequently, constantly encounter gridlocks as result of drivers (especially motorcyclists) taking one-way, thereby causing serious “go slow”. Transiting from one location to another is usually a heck of an experience, especially when passengers and drivers alike have to literally spend the whole day in traffic for what should have ordinarily been a journey of minutes or even a few hours. Noise and air pollutions make the already bad and pitiable journey more inconvenient. Well, we can all cry blue murder about the annoying situation of vehicular movements in our dear state, however, the writer have been benevolent to give a few suggestions that could prove very invaluable to solving the perennial road congestion problems. Illegal parking of vehicles (especially trucks and trailers) on our major road should be discouraged and perpetrators punished.
