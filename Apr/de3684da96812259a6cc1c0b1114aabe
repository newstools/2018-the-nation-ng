Ex-Big Brother Naija housemates, Bambam and Teddy A, have been treated to a one of a kind homecoming party at the Rumours nightclub in Ikeja. Courtesy of Legend Extra Stout, the night was all fun with Nigeriaâ€™s music industry fave couple, 2Baba and Annie Idibia partying with the ex housemates. They were extremely excited to meet the power couple and could not contain their excitement. Other ex-housemates like Vandora, DeeOne and Bitto were also in attendance to party with them. The lovebirds came well prepared to slay with Bambam wearing a black full fringed dress paired with pink heels and Teddy A looking all dapper in black jeans paired with an orange blazer. The ex-housemates sure had a time of their lives, from the DJ, to the interviews and photo sessions with fans, they seem to have garnered even more fans post eviction period. The show of love for this two is undeniably massive and it is safe to say they know how to enjoy a great party.
