The Police Special Fraud Unit (PSFU), Lagos, has charged the Managing Director of Legacy Foods Limited, Cyril Fasuyi, with an alleged $2,980,535.76 fraud. Fasuyi, 52, was accused of defrauding a firm, IPS Ingredis Integrated Systems Limited, of a goodsâ€™ supply contract. He was arraigned before Chief Magistrate O.O. Oshin on a four-count charge marked A/29/2018, bordering on conversion and issuance of a dud cheque. Prosecuting counsel, Wewe Adegbayi, alleged that the defendant committed the offences in Lagos, between April and July 2017. He said Fasuyi and his accomplices, who are at large, allegedly conspired and obtained goods worth $2,980.535.76 from IPS Ingredis, which was represented by Mr. Eluyera Gbadebo. The court heard that both parties agreed that Fasuyi would pay for the goods upon their delivery from Dubai, the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But when the defendant issued a Fidelity Bank cheque valued at N66,680,000 to the complainant as part payment for the goods, it was dishonoured by the bank due to insufficient funds in the account. The firm then petitioned the Commissioner of Police (CP) in charge of the PSFU in Ikoyi, Mr. Ibrahim Lamorde, who ordered an investigation and Fasuyi was arrested. The offences, according to the prosecutor, contravened sections 287, 314, 319, 322 and 411 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Fasuyi pleaded not guilty to the charges. Chief Magistrate Oshin granted him bail in the sum of N1million with two sureties in like sum.
