No fewer than 52 students took the oath of matriculation at the Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State campus of the International Institute of Journalism (IIJ) to start the 2017/2018 academic session. The Registrar, Mr Afolabi Olusola, who administered the oath on the freshers, advised them to shun vices that could terminate their academic pursuit in the school. Congratulating the students, he urged them to maintain law and order, and respect the rights of fellow students. Olusola assured the students that the institute had intensified its efforts to achieve full accreditation from the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE). The Ekiti State Commissioner for Information, Lanre Ogunsuyi, advised the students to be diligent and take their studies serious. An alumnus of the school, Ogunsuyi expressed worry over the proliferation of fake news in the social media, calling on media practitioners to initiate moves that would rid the profession of quacks. Chairman, Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) in Ekiti State, Comrade Rotimi Ojomoyela, who is the Visitor to the institute, assured the students and their parents that his leadership would rebrand the institute for better service delivery. The General Manager, Voice FM of Ado Ekiti, Mr Donald Falaye, called on the students to brace up for the challenge of modern journalism practice. He said: “You need to broaden your horizon for the sake of your future. You need to have knowledge of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and hone your skills in the field. You need to know how to tell your story and how to write better. These are the key tools to have to practice journalism in modern times.”
