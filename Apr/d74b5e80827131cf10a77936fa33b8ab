Celebration of Easter is meant to accentuate godliness, friendliness and merrymaking, hence residents should be moderate in celebration. Surulere Local Government Chairman Tajudeen Ajide said this while felicitating with the Christian faithful. Ajide sued for peaceful coexistence amongst all tribes and religions in the council. “We need to justify the sacrifice Jesus made which is highly essential and its tenets of godliness and friendliness should be exhibited by all during this period of Easter,” he said. He urged residents to expect more dividends of democracy, enjoining those without Permanent Voters Card (PVC) to get theirs so as to be able to perform their civic responsibility during elections.
