The proposed Zamfara state government owned university is expected to cost N10 billion. This was made known by Governor Abdulaziz Yari on Tuesday, when he received at his Talata-Mafara  residence,  a team of journalists who were on tour of the state. He said: “This administration started in a big way, seven years ago when we constructed several roads giving access to many social and economic opportunities to our people throughout the state and beyond. “We also hope to complete in a big way through the establishment of the state owned university which will help in advancing the education of our future generations,” he noted. The governor explained that provision of healthcare services, good education, good drinking water, electricity and agriculture was given high priority by the administration. He further said that “my administration intends to leave behind good legacies that subsequent governments can build upon.” Earlier, the team leader who is also the NUJ National President, Abdulwaheed Odusile told the governor that the union organised the tour  to promote good governance. He said, Zamfara was strategically chosen for the participating journalists to go and see what the Chairman, Nigeria Governors Forum had done in developing his state. The Democracy Dividend Media Tour involves  journalists drawn from various media houses. It is the brainchild  of the NUJ. Participants will visit all the states of Nigeria. NAN
