Eight year old Samuel Adeniyi stunned worshippers of the Place of Refuge Parish of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) when he recited Psalm 119 by heart, on Sunday April 8, 2018. Samuel, a primary five pupil of Success-Hill Model Academy Abuja, had earlier done the recitation during the April 2018 Holy Ghost Service of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. This got him a scholarship award from the wife of the General Overseer, Pastor (Mrs.) Folu Adeboye. It should be noted that Psalm 119 is the longest chapter of the bible, with 176 verses. Experts say it is a specially crafted poem with important themes focusing on the Truth and necessity of God’s Word and on His very character. Speaking to the Nation after the service, Samuel said it took him three weeks to learn the verses. “I am excited. It took me three weeks to prepare, and I am happy that I have achieved this.” His Father, Mr. Sofoluwe Adeniyi, an educationist and the proprietor of Samuel’s school expressed joy at his son’s intelligence. “Watching his academic growth over the years, I can tell you by God’s grace that Samuel can recite the   multiplication table up to twenty-five. He is a very sharp boy and I am happy about that. Speaking on how Samuel was discovered at the Redemption Camp, Mr. Adeniyi said “This is not the first time that he has done long bible recitations. He has done four previous presentations before. “I just prayed in January, asking God to give him the grace to recite Psalm 119 in full, and here we have it now.  He was just called upon, and he recited it. Mr Sofoluwe finally thanked the members of the Parish who gave a honorarium offering for him, and also expressed thanksgiving to the wife of the General Overseer for the scholarship.
