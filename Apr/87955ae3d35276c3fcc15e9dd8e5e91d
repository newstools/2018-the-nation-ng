The young men seize upon the unfortunate but good opportunity to ‘enjoy’ a little. They go on an expensive night out. The Landlord’s daughter (Segilola Ogidan) turns up the following morning and gives the boys 24-hour notice to pay up or face eviction. They embark on an overnight scheme to recover the rent, leading to a dangerous encounter with an eccentric drug baron (Frank Adekunle Macaulay), a desperate robbery attempt, a gambling adventure, and an ego war with the neighborhood bully, Orlando (Mawuli Gavor). All the while they were hounded by Ngozi (Bisola Aiyeola), the neighborhood gossip, who just wants a piece of the action. Hitting the Cinemas soon, Cheta Chukwu promises a story like you have never seen before, a feel good comedy and an extraordinary acting skill from the young actors with PayDay.
