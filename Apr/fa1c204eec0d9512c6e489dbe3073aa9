SUPPORTERS of President Muhammadu Buhari under the auspices of Buhari Media Support Group (BMSG) has asked the Senate leadership to caution senators against the use of foul language on Nigerian leaders on the floor of the senate and during plenary. The supporters took exception to what they described as conspiratorial stance by some senators against the Buhari administration, abusing their immunity to use incendiary remarks on the President during their sittings. In a statement signed by Chairman and Secretary, Austin Braimoh and Cassidy Madueke respectively, the group said it was particularly uncharitable for Senator Eyinaya Abaribe to use foul language against the President, having been quoted as saying that Nigerians have been indulging President Buhari who he described as “incompetent”.  BMSG said it took exception to such remarks by Senator Abaribe, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) member, during Thursday’s plenary, describing it as reprehensible and amounting to an irresponsible brand of politics the opposition has been exhibiting over time. The group urged the Senate leadership to always prevent its chamber from becoming a circus that allows the use of profane and insulting language as lingua franca with the President often the victim. The group said: “Senator Abaribe’s comments on the floor of the Senate, which engendered a rowdy session, are not just shameful to the institution of the Nigerian Senate but also defiles the hallowed office of the President and even the Senate chamber.” They also called on Senator Abaribe to tender an unreserved apology to Nigerians and to the President of Nigeria on the ill-conceived remarks credited to him, and for him to know henceforth that the Senate chamber is not to be desecrated in any way.
