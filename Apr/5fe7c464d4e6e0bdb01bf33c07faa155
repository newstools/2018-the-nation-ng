President Muhammadu Buhari will visit Bauchi State on Thursday. He is expected to launch 500 tractors and roads built by the Mohammed Abubakar-led administration. Commissioner for Information Ibrahim Sade, who spoke yesterday at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) secretariat, said each benefiting farmer will deposit 10 per cent down payment of N15 million, which is the cost of each tractor. Some of the roads to be inaugurated are within Bauchi metropolis, while some are at Azare and Misau local government areas. This is the first time Buhari will be visiting Bauchi, a place he regards as his second home, since his election in 2015.
