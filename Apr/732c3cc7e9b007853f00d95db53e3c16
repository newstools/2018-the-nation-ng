A 28-year-old 400-level Philosophy student in Olabisi Onabanjo University (OOU), Lynda Aigbodega, is down with leukaemia (cancer of the blood). She needs N5m for treatment. Aigbodega’s elder brother, Emmanuel who spoke with The Nation, said she has been down with the illness and on treatment for over two years. He explained that she has swollen gums, adding that she has respiratory track issues which have made her blood strength weak. He said Aigbodega’s illness started with repeated head ache, nothing that the family did not know she was then suffering from leukaemia. Emmanuel said: “When she began to experience repeated bouts of headache, over two years ago, we did not know she had leukaemia, until the day she collapsed on campus; then she was later diagnosed as a blood cancer patient. “She is a lively lady before the illness began. Since the past two years, she has not been going to school as she ought to. She only goes to school when exams draw nearer; her friends help her to get the summary of the lectures and she seats for the exam. “She has received treatment at some hospitals, including the General Hospital, Gbagada, Lagos and Divine Touch Herbal Clinic, Benin City. Emmanuel said the family had exhausted all they had on her treatment and can no longer afford the payment for the N5m surgery. He said the family is seeking the support of Nigerians to come to Aigbodega’s aid and give her the chance to live a normal life again.
