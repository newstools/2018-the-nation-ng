Manchester United defender Chris Smalling believes Tottenham Hotspur are a different side when on the back foot. The England international was talking in advance of tonight’s FA Cup semi-final at Wembley. United was beaten badly early in the league when both sides last clashed at Wembley – but Smalling reckons things can be very different on this weekend. “Obviously, we started very slowly in that game and they got the early goal, which put us on the back foot,” Smalling explained to MUTV. “We couldn’t really get back into the game, even though, in the second half, we were a lot better. But when we are on the front foot, like the home game when we played them at Old Trafford, when you get after them, that’s not something that they like. “I think they like to control the game at their own tempo but if we can get after them and disrupt them, we’ve seen that we can beat them. “I think everybody can expect an exciting game because there is obviously a lot at stake. Both teams will be tactically spot-on and then it’s up to the high-class individuals that each team has got to produce something special. It wouldn’t surprise me if that was how the game was decided.”
