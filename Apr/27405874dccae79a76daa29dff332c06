Two Nollywood thespians Richard Mofe-Damijo known as RMD and Ego Boyo, both famed for their role in the 90s series, ‘Checkmate’, will return to the small screen on May 6. The new family show, a pet project of RMD Productions, according to the actor, will see the fans of ‘Violated’ and ‘Checkmate’ take a ride down memory lane as Ego Boyo and himself return to the screen for the first time together in nearly two decades. The actor who hinted at a comeback with the actress whom he has starred alongside in the past said; “My journey with Ego Boyo started nearly 30 years ago, our first encounter being on the production of ‘Checkmate’ when my dear friend, Amaka Igwe pulled me in as the villain Segun Kadiri on the highly coveted TV series. “One of the most remarkable things about Ego is that despite the fact that she is born with a silver spoon into the family of the highly respected late Justice Nnamani she was super disciplined (she still is), very humble and extremely committed.” He continued, “Our status as Nigerian TV sweethearts rose with the movie ‘Violated’ as ‘Tega’ and ‘Peggy’ became the toast of Violated fans. Since then Ego has gone ahead to becoming wife, mother, accomplished business woman and the president of International Women’s Society. “Over 25 years later Tega and Peggy are back together again on my new TV “DramCom” The Mr X Family Show. I can only hope that getting back together again on TV will tickle fans of Ann Hathrope and Segun Kadiri and the fans of Tega and Peggy who have been craving to have them grace their TV screens again. Ego and I are pretty excited about this and hope the excitement catches on”. Ego is also the President of International Women’s Society.
