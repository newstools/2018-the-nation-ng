An FCT Area Court Judge, Abubakar Sadiq, on Thursday sentenced an auto-mechanic, Sa’ad Yahaya, to two months imprisonment for attempting to steal a generator. The court sentenced Yahaya of Wuse Zone 4, Abuja, after he pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of criminal trespass and attempt to commit theft. Yahaya had begged the court for leniency after admitting to the crime. The judge, who found the convict guilty as charged, held that the sentence would serve as deterrent to other would-be offenders. Earlier, the prosecutor, Dalhatu Zannah, had told the court that on April 11, one Nuhu Haruna of Benson crescent Utako, Abuja, reported the incident at the Utako Police Station. Zannah alleged that the defendant and three others now at large criminally trespassed into the complainant’s house and attempted to steal his generator. The prosecutor told the court that while the defendant was arrested, his accomplices escaped. He said the offences  contravened Sections 348 and 95 of the Penal Code. NAN
