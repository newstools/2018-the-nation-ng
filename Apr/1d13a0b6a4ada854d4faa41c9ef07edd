Chief Magistrate F. A. Azeez gave the ruling after the accused pleaded not guilty to the charge. Ajayi, who resides at Immaculate Street, Baiyeku, Ikorodu, is standing trial on a charge of sexual assault by penetration. Earlier, Police Prosecutor John Iberedem told the court that the accused committed the offence on March 15 on a football field in Baiyeku area of Ikorodu. “The accused was playing football with the 10-year-old boy and other students and when others left the field, he grabbed the boy and dragged him to the fence before assaulting him. “When the boy got home, he told his parents. The accused was interrogated and the case was reported to the police, who arrested him,’’ he said. The offence contravened Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015. Our reporter gathered that the section prescribes life imprisonment for offenders. The case was adjourned until May 5.
