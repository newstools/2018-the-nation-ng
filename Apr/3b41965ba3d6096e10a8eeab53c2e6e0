The Grand Council of Yoruba Youths, Agbarijo Egbe Odo Yoruba, has pledged to uphold the unity of the Yoruba race. According to it, “unity among the Yoruba is non-negotiable.” The organisation spoke in Lagos at the sixth Yoruba Youth Leadership Summit, known as Gbangbadekun. The summit, chaired by Emeritus Methodist Archbishop Ayo Ladigbolu, featured participants, including representatives of youth organisations, market women associations, artisans’ unions and other interest groups. It called for the quarterly convocation of the meeting through which the Yoruba elected into positions could give account of their stewardship. The summit rued the absence of guest speakers, Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola and his Ekiti State counterpart, Ayo Fayose. Ladigbolu’s idea of consulting the Ooni of Ife, Oba Enitan Adeyeye Ogunwusi Ojaja II and Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Olayiwola Adeyemi III, on the future of the summit, was applauded by participants. The summit urged Southwest governors to uphold the welfare of victims of the struggle to actualise M.K.O. Abiola’s June 12, 1993, mandate, “as this will “encourage genuine continuity of democratic struggle by younger generations”.
