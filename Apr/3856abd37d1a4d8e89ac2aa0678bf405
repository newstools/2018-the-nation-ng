ENGLISH Premier League club, Arsenal is reportedly disturbed about CSKA Moscow’s rejuvenated forward Ahmed Musa, who is on loan from Leicester City, as both sides clash in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League quarter-finals on Thursday, AOIFootball.com reports. Musa, who has found his form following his return to the club where he won three Russian Premier League titles, knows the Arsene Wenger-tutored side in and out, having played against them, while at Leicester, and will be the main man to watch on Thursday night. The Nigerian forward has scored two goals since returning, including an important one in the second leg against Lyon that saw his team qualify for the quarterfinals. Arsene Wenger’s side is brimming with confidence following their 3-0 victory over Stoke City at the weekend but will be battle ready at the Emirates when they host CSKA. Meanwhile, Musa is among the four strikers in the Army Men’s traveling party, and will compete for one of the attacking positions with Vitinho, Timur Zhamaletdinov and Fedor Chalov. The Leicester City loanee will be hoping to play his 36th game in a European club competition against the Gunners.
