Fire on Saturday razed the two-storey building of Kaduna State Independent Electoral Commission (KADSIECOM), few weeks before the local government election in the state. Elections in the 23 LGAs and 255 wards will take place on May 12. An eyewitness, Ibrahim Musa, said the huge fire was noticed at 11:24 a.m. on top of the building located along Sokoto Road, GRA, Kaduna. Musa said the huge flames followed a thick smoke that was noticed from the top floor of the building earlier. The cause of the fire has not been ascertained. KADSIECOM said it had procured 6,000 electronic machine and card readers for the local council elections. NAN
