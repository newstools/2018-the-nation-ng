The Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday adjourned till May 7, the trial of the Managing Director of Agastorm Limited, Nonso Udoye, for allegedly cloning the production and registration logo of the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON). Justice Saliu Saidu upheld Udoye’s application for adjournment following his change of counsel. Udoye, of 36, Ayara Street, Surulere, Lagos, was arraigned by the SON on February 25 on a 15-count charge of forgery and counterfeiting. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and was remanded in prison following his inability to perfect his bail terms. At the commencement of proceedings on Wednesday, his counsel, Emmanuel Okoroafor, told the court that he just took over the matter and needed time to study the Proof of Evidence. He sought an adjournment to enable him familiarise himself with the case. But prosecution counsel, Amaka Allen-Ngbale, opposed him. She said: “The matter is for trial. We have our witness in court who is a police officer. We are ready to go on.” In a Bench Ruling, Justice Saidu upheld the defence counsel’s prayer and adjourned till May 7 for trial.
