Police on Tuesday failed to parade the embattled Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye, at the Kogi State Police Command. The Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, Mr. Aremu Adeniran, who addressed journalists in Lokoja, however confirmed that Melaye was in police custody in Abuja. He said the senator would be arraigned in court at the end of investigation. He said Melaye surrendered himself to the police on Tuesday morning. The embattled senator was declared wanted by the police following his alleged refusal to honour police invitation to defend allegations of illegal arms possession levelled against him by two suspected criminals, Kabiru Saidu (Osama) and Nuhu Salisu (Small). The duo were paraded by the police in Lokoja.
