Tyronne Ebuehi is not in tip-top condition and could be omitted from the ADO Den Haag squad for their Eredivisie clash against Heerenveen tonight. Speaking to reporters on Monday, manager of ADO Den Haag, Fons Groenendijk, confirmed that the Nigeria international right-back will have to undergo a late fitness test which will determine his availability for the game. ”Later in the day, we’ll hear more about his (Ebuehi’s) physical condition. If he cannot play, Trevor David starts, ” said Groenendijk. “Goppel can play. I am careful with him, so I changed him against FC Twente. I hope to hear more about Sheraldo Becker today.” Ebuehi has yet to complete a game since his return from international duty in March, subbing out in games against AZ Alkmaar and FC Twente and was omitted from the 18-man squad vs FC Utrecht on April 8 due to a groin injury. The 22-year-old could make his competitive debut for the Super Eagles in the next two months if selected for the 2018 World Cup.
