President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday that unity of the country would remain the paramount objective of his administration. He gave the assurance while receiving a delegation of the Tijjaniya Movement led by Sheikh Muhammadu Mahi Ibrahim Inyass at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. In a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, he said ‘‘I will continue to do everything within my powers to unite Nigeria.’’ The President commended the religious group for the peaceful conduct of their annual convention and urged them to bring the same to bear in promoting peace, unity and inter-religious harmony in Nigeria. He also lauded the group for complementing government efforts in bringing socio- economic development and stability in the country by encouraging discipline, unity and spirituality among its members. Reiterating his remarks on Thursday at the palace of Emir of Bauchi, Alhaji Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu, after he was presented with the Holy Quran, the President said the gift of Holy Quran is the highest anyone can receive and a reminder to seek and uphold justice in the service of the nation. The leader of the group, Sheikh Inyass, told the President that members of the group would continue to support and appreciate his ‘‘noble agenda for the benefit of all Nigerians because they believe elected officials must be accountable, incorruptible and God fearing.’’
