Members of the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) have threatened to drag the manager of Tuface Idibia, Mr. Efe Omorogbe, before the Benin Monarch, Oba Ewuare II, for engaging in conduct that negates the culture of Edo people and the creative community. The COSON members said the decision to drag Omorogbe before the Benin Monarch was for him to be called to order and appropriate sanctions imposed on him. Speaking at a press briefing in Benin City, Chief Arala Osula, the Osula of Benin, urged Omorogbe to stop parading himself as the Chairman of the Governing Board of COSON. Chief Osula said they only recognised Tony Okoroji as Chairman of COSON and not Omorogbe. Reading a letter addressed to Omorogbe by the Edo COSON, Chief Osula stated that their grouse against Omorogbe was because they felt the support and contributions of Okoroji. The letter reads in parts: “It is unfortunate that given your position of visibility as the manager of Tuface Idibia, no one in the state as felt you impact in any way. “While you purport to come from Edo State, we do not know you because you always go around with your nose in the air. “We are shocked that despite our clear democratic choice of Okoroji as COSON chairman, you have mischievously and fraudulently continued to parade yourself as Chairman of COSON. Your behaviour is contrary to the norms and culture of the great people of Edo State.”
