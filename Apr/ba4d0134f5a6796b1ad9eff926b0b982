Stakeholders in Osun State, including religious organisations, have been urged to support the Rauf Aregbesola administration in its bid to fully overhaul the education sector in the state. Special Adviser, Ministry of Information and Strategy, Mr. Semiu Okanlawon, said at the weekend that Aregbesola had proven in seven years that so much could be done with so little. Okanlawon, who was the chairman at the triennial congress of the Ansar-ud-deen Society of Nigeria (Osun Branch), held in Iwo last weekend, said Aregbesola’s government’s vision in education tallied with the mission of the society which he said began as a movement to give Muslims quality education without surrendering their faith. He said with education as the first basic reason for the formation of the society 95 years ago, it is incumbent on the society to support a government that gives its all to the promotion of education and advancement of knowledge. Okanlawon said: “As a religious body that had promoted education over the decades, we must not fail to remind ourselves of the critical need to join hands with the present administration of Ogbeni Rauf Adesoji Aregbesola in its manifest mission to transform education in the state. “Though it is still an ongoing project, this government has constructed new schools and refurbished many others. It is gratifying to note that the second elementary school to be commissioned in this state was the Ansar-ud-deen Elementary Government School, Isale Osun, Osogbo. As we must all be aware, the state has gone ahead to complete schools, such as Ansar-ud-deen Elementary School, Sabo, Osogbo, Ansar-ud-deen Middle School, Odoori Iwo, among others.
