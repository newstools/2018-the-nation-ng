Lagos State Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs Muslim Folami yesterday warned that residents engaging in locking their streets with iron gates would be prosecuted. At the ongoing ministerial press briefing yesterday, Folami said the present administration in the state is concerned about the safety of the people. He reminded community leaders that there is a law in Lagos State that forbids residents installing street gates indiscriminately, saying residents must obey the laws. He said: “We are not saying you should not have gates in your streets but those gates were installed should be manned 24 hours. The reason we are opposed to the practice of keeping gates perpetually locked is that there may be emergencies, there may be fire outbreak. A pregnant woman can fall into labour anytime and would want to go to the hospital if you lock the gates what happens. We have had cases where some pregnant women died because the gates were closed. “There were so many incidents of fire outbreak and the streets could not be accessed to put out the fire because the gates to the streets were closed. We will not fold our hands and allow such things to happen. What are we doing as government then if we allow such things to happen? We have decided that henceforth anyone found guilty will be punished.’ During the year under review, the commissioner said the Ministry upgraded the Lagos State University (LASU) FM and LASPOTECH FM equipment in order to deliver quality broadcasting to its audience and environs.    Folami said the ministry embarked on sensitisation tour of all the markets across the state on the need to eradicate street trading. According to him, the present administration’s commitment to rapid development at the grassroots compelled the governor to upgrade and approve six Baales to Obaship Stools.
