China has imposed tariffs of up to 25 per cent on 128 United States imports, including pork and wine, after U.S President Donald Trump raised duties on foreign steel and aluminium imports in March. The tariffs affecting some $3bn (£2.1bn) of imports begin on Monday, the BBC reports. Beijing said the move was to “safeguard China’s interests and balance” losses caused by new U.S tariffs. China had previously said it did not want a trade war but would not sit by if its economy was hurt. Mr. Trump, however, has insisted that “trade wars are good,” and that it should be “easy” for the U.S to win one. The American authorities have already announced plans for further targeted tariffs for tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports, the BBC says.
