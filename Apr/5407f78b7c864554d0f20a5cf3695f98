The Ali Modu Sheriff faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has formally dumped the party and fused into the All Progressives Congress (APC) with a promise to work with the party to ensure total victory in next yearâ€™s general elections. However, Senator Ali Modu Sheriff, who was absent from the event, was said to have travelled out of the country. But, there were insinuations that the Borno State governor may have blocked his entry into the party. The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha, who witnessed the event at the national secretariat of the party said the event has defined what will transpire in the 2019 general elections. The faction which was led to the APC Secretariat by Mr. Cairo Ojuogoh, included former Senate Leader, Taslim Folarin, Hon. Segun Odebunmi, Hon. Kamila Lado Rasheed, Hon Bala Modu Sheriff, Hon. Bernard Mela, Senator Gbemisola Saraki, Hope Uzodimma, Goodluck Ogbia, Ali Gulak, Hon. E.J Agboneyema, Senator Abubakar Gada, Nnamdi Richard, as well as state chairmen of the faction from all states of the federation, except Borno and Yobe states. Receiving them into the party, National Chairman of the APC Chief John Odigie Oyegun told them to go back to their ward to formally register with the party since the APC operates from the local level.
