The National Industrial Court, Abuja, yesterday, ruled that the sack of Obba Obiechina from Nigeria Nuclear Regulatory Authority (NNRA) was lawful. Obiechina was dismissed from NNRA, when it was discovered that he drew salaries from NNRA and the Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) simultaneously for two months. Justice Rakiya Haastrup, in her judgment, said the issues for determination by the court were: “Whether the dismissal of the claimant’s appointment was unlawful. “Whether the claimant could take up a permanent and pensionable employment with another government agency at the same time. “Whether the claimant is entitled to the reliefs sought?” She said the evidence before the court showed that the claimant’s retirement from NTA took effect from September 5, 2008. Justice Haastrup noted that the claimant assumed duty at the NNRA on July 9, 2008, while his retirement benefits were being processed, and his employment with the NTA was subsisting. She said the claimant’s action was unlawful, and contravened the Public Service Rule. The judge said this deceit had made termination of his appointment lawful, as due steps were taken by the defendant before his sack. The court, therefore, dismissed the suit and reliefs sought by the claimant. Obiechina had urged the court to declare his sack unlawful, reinstate him and award him N500,000 damages. The claimant joined the Ministry of Petroleum Resources as co-respondent.
