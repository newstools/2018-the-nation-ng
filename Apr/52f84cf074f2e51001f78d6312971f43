The Nigerian Air Force said on Monday its Special Forces in conjunction with Nigerian Army troops foiled a Boko Haram suicide attack at the University of Maiduguri, Borno state. The NAF Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya, said in a statement that a suicide bomber and another Boko Haram fighter were killed during the operation. He said: “Special Forces of the Nigerian Air Force (NAF), in conjunction with some Nigerian Army (NA) troops, successfully foiled a suicide bombing attack by Boko Haram Terrorists (BHTs) at University of Maiduguri, Borno State in the night of 8 April 2018. ” The BHT suicide bombers tried to gain access into the university but were quickly detected by the NAF Special Forces. Meanwhile, the vest on one of the suicide bombers was detonated before they could gain access into the hostel, leading to a commotion. “However, there was no reported fatality except for the suicide bomber, whose counterparts immediately fled, when the NAF Special Forces and the NA troops opened fire on them. The NAF Agusta Light Utility Helicopter (LUH) then went in pursuit of the fleeing BHTs, following which an additional suicide bomber was identified and neutralized. “The NAF Agusta LUH was still searching for the other fleeing BHTs at the time of filing this report. Members of the public, especially those around the university premises are, therefore, requested to be very vigilant.”
