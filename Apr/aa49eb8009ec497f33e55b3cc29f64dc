The Minister of Defence, Gen AbdulRahaman Dambazau (rtd), yesterday inaugurated 13 newly-procured firefighting trucks at the Federal Fire Service Command, Surulere, Lagos. The minister tasked the authorities of the Federal Fire Service (FFS) on fire hazard prevention through professionalism, promising  that the Federal Government would always support them with modern firefighting equipment. “About two years ago when I visited this complex, what I found out was an eyesore. This place that is very central in  Lagos was in a comatose as there was no functional fire truck. The buildings were completely dilapidated,  and I told  the then Comptroller General  that we must do something about it. Even Lagos State Government offered to assist us, but I rejected the offer because I believed that we must start it ourselves,” the minister said. While urging the fire service authorities to ensure proper maintenance of the equipment, Dambazau disclosed that the Federal Government had approved the purchase of a simulator for the training of firemen. “We know that there are a lot of fire hazards that we must not only contain but prevent and I am happy that the Federal Fire Training School in Abuja is also doing very well to ensure that all aspects of firefighting training are carried out. I want to urge all our officers to maintain the equipment very well because they were procured with tax payers’ money.’’ Dambazau said firefighters in the country did not enjoy what they are currently enjoying from the Federal Government in the last 30 years.
