A GROUP, H20, an amalgam of seven non-governmental organisations seeking an end to open defecation and lack of clean water, has urged the Federal Government to provide potable water. According to its spokesman, Anthony Erewele, attention should be given to potable water by governments, regretting that people drink water from contaminated sources. He said: ‘’As one of the critical stakeholders in the quest for clean environment and equality in the distribution of basic amenities, we are appalled that nothing has changed in the attitude of government to the plight of Nigerians, who are continuously subjected to health hazards as a result of drinking contaminated water from streams and rivers, because of lack of access to potable water, despite huge budgetary allocation for provision of adequate clean water. “It is instructive to note that both the rural dwellers and their counterparts in the city are affected by this problem of lack of access to clean water. While the rural dwellers continue to suffer in silence, the urban dwellers who can afford to drill borehole are also frustrated by the infiltration of sewage into boreholes resulting in environmental and health hazards.”
