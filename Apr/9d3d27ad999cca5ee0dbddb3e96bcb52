At least 15 newly recruited teachers were on Tuesday robbed on their way to Dogon Dawa village in Birnin Gwari local government of Kaduna State where they have been posted by the state government to teach in primary schools. The state government had last year sacked 21,780 primary school teachers for incompetence and had subsequently recruited new ones who are being posted to various schools in the state. The teachers numbering 24 had left Kaduna in the morning and had stopped over at Birnin Gwari at the State Universal Basic Education (SUBEB) office to inform the officials about their resumption of work. One of the teachers, Moses Joseph, said they had not driven for up to 10 minutes when they ran into some hoodlums at a road block. According to him, the robbers forced them out of their vehicles and dispossessed them of all items including cash. He said: “They collected all our handsets, books and they even went away with the original credentials of one of us. “They asked us who we were and we told them we are teachers posted to Dogon Dawa and one of them said ‘ah! yaran El-Rufai no?”
