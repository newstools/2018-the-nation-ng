Enugu State Police Command said it has arrested a suspected cattle herdsman with one AK-47 rifle and 7.62 ammunition at Isigwe Ugbawka community, Nkanu East local government area of the state. The command’s spokesman, Ebere Amaraizu, said in a statement on Saturday that the suspect was arrested on April 4 at a farmland in the area. “The suspected herder is now helping the police operatives in their full scale investigations,’’ he said. He said the state Commissioner of Police, Mr Mohammed Danmallam, had visited the community where he commended residents for their timely and useful information which led to the arrest and arms recovery. Amaraizu said the police commissioner used the occasion to release all the state command’s distress/emergency numbers to further strengthen police-public partnership. Responding, the Chairman of Nkanu East LGA, Ikechukwu Ubagu, said “there is no tension in the area as farmers are still in their various farmlands.” “The council is assuring the police commissioner of its continual partnership with the police,’’ he said.
