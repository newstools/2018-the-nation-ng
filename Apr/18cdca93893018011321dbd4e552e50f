If there is any table tennis player that believes the Nigeria will pose a threat to other teams in the fight for dominance at the XXI Commonwealth Games, it is England’s talisman – Liam Pitchford. Pitchford, who plies his trade in the lucrative French elite league, told NationSport in London that he believed that Nigerians could compete for dominance with quality players, such as Aruna Quadri, among others. This year, the 24-year-old Chesterfield-born star is hoping to turn the silver and bronze medals won at his two appearances in 2010 Delhi and 2014 Glasgow to gold in Gold Coast, Australia. “I think we have quite a few players who could win the singles event; the Indian players are strong, Nigeria’s Quadri Aruna will be the top seed probably, my teammates also and of course GAO Ning. So it should be a very close and exciting tournament. But I must also admit that the Nigerian team is an experienced side who are also heavyweights in table tennis and we cannot look down on them in Australia.” Being the engine room of the English team at the 2018 World Team Cup in London, Pitchford is hopeful that his team would dominate others. “The target is to bring as many medals back with us as possible. Especially the team because that is the first event and we really want the gold medal after two silver medals in a row. Also in the singles, I want to improve on my bronze from Glasgow,” he said. Being his third appearance at the Commonwealth Games, Pitchford never takes his selection with kids’ love, saying, “It is a great honour and I’m very proud to represent my country in such a big event. Delhi 2010 provided me with an opportunity to prove myself on the table tennis scene and win medals and that’s what I did. I am in good shape at the moment, still some small preparations to go before the start of the tournament but we will be ready to give our all.”
