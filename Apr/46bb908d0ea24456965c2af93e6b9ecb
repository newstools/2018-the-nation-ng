Two men were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos for allegedly obtaining N650,000 from under false pretence. The defendants, Alex Atiporu, 30, an electrician and Emmanuel Akinseye, 35, an estate agent, are facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining by false pretence and stealing. Prosecutor Raji Akeem said the offences were committed in April 2017, at 17, Eniola Akinsanya Street, Mafoluku, Oshodi, Lagos. He said the complainant, Mrs. Rose Obasi, was introduced to Akinseye (first accused) by Atiporu (second accused). “The first accused told the complainant that the second accused would help her secure a three-bedroom apartment. “The accused persons took the complainant to the apartment for inspection and she indicated interest. “A week after, she paid N650, 000 into the second accused person’s account, but after the payment both accused persons bolted. “When the complainant got to the apartment, she was told that another person had secured the place,’’ Akeem said. He said the case was reported at the police station and the accused were placed on the wanted list. “The police got information about the accused persons’ whereabouts and they were arrested,’’ the prosecutor said. The offences contravene Sections 287, 314 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The accused pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Jadesola Adeyemi-Ajayi granted the accused bail at N50, 000 each with two sureties each. She adjourned the case till May 7 for mention.
