Activities opened on the Nigerian Stock Exchange ( NSE ) on Monday with a negative trend as the market capitalisation lost N150 billion and volume depreciated by 42.82 per cent. The market capitalisation, which opened at N14.753 trillion, shed N150 billion or 1.02 per cent to close at N14.603 trillion, amid losses by blue chips. Also, the All-Share Index dipped by 411.98 points or 1.01 per cent to close at 40,429.18 compared with 40,841.14 posted on Friday, April 6. The market was weighed down by profit taking by some investors with major blue chips recording price losses. Unilever recorded the highest loss to lead the losers’ table, shedding N4.80 to close at N55 per share. Lafarge Africa trailed with a loss of N3.20 to close at N41 in spite of N1.50 final dividend declared for the financial year ended Dec. 31, 2017. Dangote Cement shed N2.90 to close at N252, while Guinness depreciated by N1 to close at N103. Dangote Flour also lost 65k to close at N13.15 per share. Analysts attributed the development to sell-off and profit taking on high cap stocks that suffered losses after their share prices were adjusted for dividend declared and some companies that declared unimpressive earnings.
