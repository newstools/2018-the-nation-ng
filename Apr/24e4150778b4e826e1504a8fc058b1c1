The Visionscape Sanitation Solutions (VSS) has restated its commitment to the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI) policy. The firm expressed its willingness to work with PSP operators. Visionscape’s Head of Corporate Communication Motunrayo Elias  said this during a chat with The Nation in Lagos. She said over 100 PSP operators had joined Visionscape to assist in waste collection. “Our plan is to serve the residential areas of Lagos. We have a lot of black spots or illegal dump sites in the state. We want to clear  the black spots before moving into the residential areas,” she said. Elias praised the PSPs for the work they did before Visionscape came. She said the company was willing to work with PSP operators. She explained that tremedous progress had been made. “We are willing and we have made progress and we will work together,” Elias said, adding that though the firm started operations last January,  progress had been made in delivering a cleaner Lagos. She said Visionscape was embarking on advocacy programmes at the grassroots. VSS Head of Planning, Kiran Reddy noted that the waste management company had cleared 2000 of the 5000 illegal dumpsites or black spots in the state. He said illegal 5000 dumpsites were identified during a study of the state. “We found approximately 5000 black spots with waste from five tonnes to 150 tonnes and we have cleaned up approximately 2000 black spots. We rented trucks, used pay loaders to clean these dumpsites,” he explained. Highlighting efforts by the firm to rid Lagos of refuse, Kiran said over 15, 000 bins had been distributed across the state and that by the end August, over 20,000 galvanised bins would have been distributed. He noted that four million plastic bags had been distributed to residents of Lagos, adding that 10 million plastic bags would be distributed before the end of the year.
