Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vanguard, a group comprising social activists, non-governmental organisations, artisans, youths and political groups which has been canvassing for five million votes for Governor Akinwunmi Ambode’s re-election, has launched a House-to-House campaign in Amuwo Odofin and Surulere Local Government Areas to ensure eligible voters collect their Permanent Voters Card (PVC). Mr. Joe Igbokwe, who spoke to newsmen at an event in Surulere, said nothing will change the five million votes targeted for the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode in the next year’s election. Igbokwe said, apart from the performance of the governor in improving the infrastructure of the city, his handling of the state’s economy was another major reason why Lagosians must support him. He said Ambode would further transform the state to a mega city if given another chance. “In recognition of his hard work, we are going to come out in millions to support him once again through voting. Under his leadership, we have seen physical development across Lagos.” The Apex Chairman of Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vanguard, Segun Olulade said they were satisfied with the governor’s performance in office and would support him again. Olulade said: “As we speak, it is as if the good people of Lagos have collectively decided to keep the governor on the job beyond 2019. Simply put, it is because he has performed. All the people and groups endorsing him gave that same reason and we can all see his achievements speaking for him.” Coordinator-General of Itesiwaju Ipinle Eko Vangaurd Seyi Bamigbade, said: “In all of his numerous achievements, which we can see and feel across the nooks and crannies of the state, Ambode has been stylish and meticulous in manner in the way he runs the affairs of the state. Even the opposition in the state has agreed that Ambode has delivered on his election promises. He promised to make Lagos work for everyone and he has done that for all to see.”
