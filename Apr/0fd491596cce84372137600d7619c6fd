Osun State government has won $1.5 million contract from the Federal Government to produce cables and assemble decoders for digitalisation of television. Finance Commissioner Mr. Bola Oyebamiji, who spoke at the training of the second batch of 5,000 youths on ICT, organised by RLG-Adulawo Company Ltd in Ilesa, said the Federal Government had announced September as the deadline for the digitalisation of television. He said the government won the contract when representatives of the Federal Government came to RLG-Adulawo Company, established by the Governor Rauf Aregbesola administration, to assemble electronic devises, and saw its capacity and competence to produce cables and assemble decoders. Oyebamiji said the government would spend N100 million in training youths in ICT despite paucity of fund. He advised the beneficiaries to make the best of the training. The commissioner said N320 million was spent on training youths in the first batch of the programme, adding that the training cost was higher than that of the second batch because the beneficiaries were sent to Ghana for internship after their classroom training and because RLG-Adulawo Company had not been established at that time.
