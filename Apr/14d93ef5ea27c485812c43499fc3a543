A member of the House of Representatives, Abdullahi Muslim, has donated over 700,000 exercise books to 17 primary schools in Birnin Kebbi Local Government Area of Kebbi. Muslim, who represents Birnin Kebbi/Kalgo/Bunza Federal Constituency, said while distributing the books on Tuesday in Birnin Kebbi that the gesture was to assist parents and encourage enrollment. “The effort is made to encourage students of various schools with tools needed to effectively enhance their learning, as education is in critical condition in the state,” he added. The lawmaker said a committee had been set up to ensure smooth and just distribution of the books to the selected primary schools. “We want to assist our children to have the needed learning materials in order to excel. “The books will also be distributed in all the 35 wards of my constituency; what remain now are Kalgo and Bunza local government areas, and the committee will do the remaining distribution,” he said. He urged parents in the constituency to prioritise their children’s education for a brighter future. A cross section of schools headmasters commended the lawmaker for the gesture and called on him to do more as education needed more support and encouragement in the area. NAN
