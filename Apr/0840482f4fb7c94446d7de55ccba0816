An Ikeja Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday granted N50,000 bail to a 17-year-old boy, Jamiu Kazeem, standing trial over alleged gang raped of an 18-year-old girl. The Magistrate, Mr P.E. Nwaka, admitted Kazeem to bail with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case until April 25 for trial. The accused, who resides in Meiran area of Lagos State, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge of rape. Earlier, the prosecutor, Insp. Christopher John, told the court that Kazeem and four others still at large committed the offence on Sept. 17, 2017 at No. 27, Abule St., Agbelekale, Meiran, a Lagos Suburb. John said that the accused and his accomplice accosted the girl, lured her to an uncompleted building and gang raped her. According to him, when the girl got home she narrated everything that happened to her mother. “The case was subsequently reported to the police by mother of the girl,’’ John told the court. He said that the offence contravened Sections 260 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Section 260 prescribes life imprisonment for offender upon conviction. NAN
