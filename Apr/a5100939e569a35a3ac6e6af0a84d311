Participants at a two-day “train-the-trainers” workshop for civil servants in Oyo State have expressed gratitude to the State Governor, Senator Abiola Ajimobi, for his commitment to the welfare and development of the state’s workforce. This was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the workshop, held in Ibadan, on Thursday, with the theme, ‘The Imperatives of Change Management in Oyo State Public Service.’ According to the communiqué, the participants resolved to embrace work practices, which would enhance productivity and efficiency in the state civil service. Some of the resolutions include, “emphasising recruitment based on merit; attitudinal change among staff to ensure better service delivery and continuous capacity building of staff through training and re-training”. Others are, “constant review of relevant extant rules, regulations, circulars and general orders; clearer definition of the mission and vision of MDAs for effective service delivery and effective deployment of technology in day-to-day operations”. Secretary to the State Government, Mr. Olalekan Alli, delivered a keynote address at the workshop, while the lead paper was delivered by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Efficiency, Dr. Isaac Ayandele. Resource persons included retired permanent secretaries in the state and seasoned administrators, while participants comprised staff of the efficiency unit of all MDAs and political appointees.
