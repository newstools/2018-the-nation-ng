Lagos State government will today commence payment of N30 million refunds to pilgrims who performed last year’s hajj. Each pilgrim is entitled to N12, 000 each. Commissioner for Home Affairs and Amirul-Hajj Dr AbdulHakeem AbdulLateef explained that the fund was meant for some services which were not rendered to them. He said: “We agitated for refund of money meant for some services that were not rendered and it was granted. We shall share this money to the pilgrims except those who owe us. Lagos will never short-change pilgrims for whatever reason, what we are refunding belongs to them and not a gift from the government. In the past and in some states, the Amirul-Hajj diverts such funds for private use, but for me, nothing will follow any man to his grave except his good deeds. People should not be denied of what is due to them. Lagos will always strive to set good examples.” According to him, each pilgrim will get N12,000 at the State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board, Ikeja. However, he noted that pilgrims who had performed Hajj consecutively in the last five years and also took part in the last year’s Hajj will not be entitled to the refund. “Saudi Authority has increase Visa procurement fees to N200,000 for each pilgrim who had visited the Holy Land for five years, either for Umrah or to perform Hajj respectively. “Last year, we incurred additional N14 million on this set of pilgrims. So, any of our pilgrims during last year Hajj who falls in this category will not receive refund,” he stressed. He reminded intending pilgrims for this year’s exercise to obtain the National Identity Card to guarantee themselves a place among Lagos contingent. Lagos, he said, cannot process Hajj Visa for any intending pilgrims without National Identity Card. “Go and get your National Identity Card if you want to perform this year Hajj before it is too late. It is mandatory for all pilgrims.  National Identity Card is a prerequisite for Hajj Visa issuance,” he added.
