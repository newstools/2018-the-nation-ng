The Ondo State House of Assembly yesterday urged Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to bail it out of financial mess. It lamented the harsh situation of the hallowed chambers. The lawmakers, at plenary, observed that the situation have got to a stage where they used papers to fan themselves due to enormous heat occasioned by lack of stable electricity and funds to power generators. They said they were financially handicapped, stressing that they could not spend without consent of the executives. The legislators noted that financial autonomy of the Assembly will alleviate their financial predicament. Deputy Speaker Iroju Ogundeji, raising a matter of urgent importance, appealed to  Akeredolu to release fund to the parliament, to embark on constituency projects, which they had never been deprived of in the last three years. Minority leader Sola Ebiwonjumi debunked reports that the government procured utility vehicles and gave them constituency funds. The Speaker, Bamidele Oloyelogun, said the little contributions of lawmakers to their constituencies were from personal efforts through loans. He urged the governor to attend to their needs in the interest of true democratic values. Ogundeji, in a chat with The Nation, lamented that since the last three years, the government had refused to release funds to them to execute projects in their constituencies. He said: “It has got to a stage our people at home are embarrassing us for having nothing to show for our representation in the past three years. “Former Governor Olusegun Mimiko refused to release the fund in two years we spent with him, Now we have spent one year with the Akeredolu administration, it is the same problem and we are having only one year left with nothing to show in our constituencies. Calls made to the Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Governor and former Speaker, Oluwasegunota Bolarinwa, were not responded to last night.
