Promoter Eddie Hearn hopes to be able to make a deal for a unification fight between heavyweight champions Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder when he is in New York next week. Hearn is waiting to hear from WBC champion Wilder over a showdown with British fighter Joshua, who holds the IBF, WBA and WBO titles. It is hoped, though, a deal – with a reported fee of some 12.5million US dollars (£8.8million) said to be on the table – can be thrashed out to get both heavyweights into the ring sooner rather than later. ‘We made an offer last week. We haven’t heard from them yet. There’s been a bit of talking behind the scenes,’ Hearn said on Sky Sports News. ‘We are in New York next week for the Danny Jacobs fight and Katie Taylor unification. I’m going to look to meet up with them in New York, get face to face with them, look into the white of their eyes, and just see if we can make a deal. We have made an offer that we feel is substantial, if not, we’re happy to talk about the numbers and look at their ideas as well.’ Joshua has been told by the WBA he must put his ‘super’ belt on the line against contender Alexander Povetkin. Hearn admitted that situation had made on-going negotiations with the American’s camp more complicated. ‘Anthony’s made it clear – that’s the fight he wants next, the Deontay Wilder fight,’ Hearn added. ‘With these mandatories coming up as well, Povetkin, and the possible IBF mandatory, I’ve said before there are not many opportunities to make an undisputed fight. Really the focus is for us to make the Deontay Wilder fight next. ‘If not, it has to be the one after, and we’ll have to deal with a mandatory in the meantime. It could be Alexander Povetkin. Generally, from AJ’s side, from our side, from the team’s side, the Wilder fight is one we have no problems with at all. We’ve just got to find the right deal and we’ll be trying to do that next week in New York.’
