Ondo State House of Assembly yesterday dissolved caretaker committees in the 18 councils. This followed the expiration of their tenure. The House, at a plenary presided over by the Speaker, David Oloyelogun, asked the committees to hand over to the directors of local government administration. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu in April 2017 appointed caretaker committees. The Assembly extended the tenure last October. The House, at plenary, acknowledged the contributions of the committees to the development of the state. It was not certain last night whether or not the governor would renew their appointments. The Nation, however, gathered that the governor may appoint caretaker committees soon. Governor Akeredolu, last week, suspended the Caretaker Chairman of Ondo West Local Government, Ebenezer Akinsulire, for alleged misconduct. Petitions were written against him by members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the council.
