An Idi-Ogungun Customary Court, Agodi in Ibadan, Oyo on Wednesday dissolved  the five-year-old  marriage between Selim Osuntade and his wife, Mutiat, over her attempt to commit suicide. The Court President, Chief Mukaila Balogun held that Selim proved his case beyond reasonable doubt. Balogun said the court could not entertain the plea of Mutiat for reconciliation as the evidence given by both parties had revealed the truth. He said the court would not fold its arms and wait until the respondent killed herself because her husband had made up his mind not to love her again. ”The marriage is hereby dissolved and the custody of the two children from the union is given to the respondent. ”The petitioner should pay N8, 000 monthly for the upkeep of the children. ”In addition, he should pay N12, 000 for the respondent’s house rent and N5, 000 for her to move her luggage,” he said. Earlier, Selim had approached the court for the dissolution of his marriage, alleging that his wife of five years was too troublesome to live with. The petitioner told the court that he had denied his wife sex to see if she would change her bad character instead she became suicidal. ”My lord, I decided to starve her sexually so that she can change from her bad behaviour. ”Though she pleaded with me and told me that she would change, but i insisted that she should turn a new leaf first, instead, she attempted to hang herself in my room. ”I see the suicide attempt as another way to put me into trouble, therefore, the court should end this marriage to save me from her troubles,” he said. The respondent, Mutiat, denied the allegation that she attempted to kill herself and urged the court to save her marriage. “I confirmed that my husband denied me sex for several months and I begged him to forgive me for any wrong thing I have done to him but he refused to accept my apology. ”I am not ready to leave my matrimonial home with our two kids, the court should help us reconcile,’’ she said.
