It’s no longer news that Nigeria’s female Blessing Okagbare will not be defending the 100m and 200m races she won at the 21st Commonwealth Games, which starts tomorrow in Gold Coast, Australia. Okagbare, who last week broke Mary Onyali’s 200m record pulled out of the 100m and 200m events of the Commonwealth Games and opted to compete for Nigeria in only the relay race. Former Olympic gold medallist, Enefiok Udo Bong, revealed yesterday that real reason Okagbare decided to take part in just one event was because she had been nursing an injury for three years. NationSport also gathered that in spite of Okagbare’s pleas to government to come to her aid in terms of securing needed funds to treat her injury, nothing was done to support her. Okagbare was said to have paid 19000USD to a Swedish doctor to treat her and even lost some of her Nike endorsement in the process. Udo Obong disclosed that as far as Okagbare was concerned, personal preservation takes precedent over national interest because of what she had gone through. However, NationSport could not independently verify if Okagbare sustained the injury while competing for Nigeria.
