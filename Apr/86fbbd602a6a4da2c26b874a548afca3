Senator Oluremi Tinubu has  charged Nigerians to emulate Jesus christ’s life of sacrifice. In her Easter message, the senator representing the Lagos Central Senatorial District, Lagos State, said, “Christ lived a life of service, going around teaching, healing and doing good. Also, the suffering and death of Jesus, for the redemption of mankind, a race of people who vilified him, is the most notable act of service and sacrifice known to mankind.” She called on “those who mean well for the greater good of our country to aspire to public service. Likewise, we must ensure even as another electioneering season approaches that we only support those whose mandates reflect the greater good of us all.”
