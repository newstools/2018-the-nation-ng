It was fanfare at the University of Lagos (UNILAG) when three sets of graduates of the Department of Nursing were inducted into the nursing profession. The event was held at the Old Great Hall of the College of Medicine. The inductees comprised 2015, 2016 and 2017 sets. Dignitaries from all walks of life gathered in the auditorium to witness the induction. They included the Provost of the College of Medicine, Prof E.A. Lesi, Head of Service of Lagos State Mrs Folasade Adesoye, college secretary Mr Oladejo Azeez and Dr Malvis Humphrey, who was the guest speaker. Coordinator of the department Dr Florence Folami praised the graduating sets for their patience and academic performance. She urged them to be good ambassador of the school as they move to the labour world. Dr Folami said the induction was delayed for three years because of accreditation of the department. She assured the guests that the school had secured full accreditation for the nursing programme. Some of the inductees, who spoke to our correspondent, expressed their joy, thanking God and their parents. Other highlights of the event included presentation of prizes to the Best Graduating Students and the provost of the college, dean of clinical Sciences and the pioneer coordinator of the department.
