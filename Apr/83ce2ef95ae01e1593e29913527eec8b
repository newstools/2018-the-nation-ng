 It has been a good run for Bayern Munich this season and team’s stars thought it wise to celebrate in style. The German giants’ Twitter account tweeted a picture of Thomas Muller, Sandro Wagner, Joshua Kimmich and Mats Hummels all celebrating Tuesday’s 6-2 win at Bayer Leverkusen. The quartet  are a picture of delight as they pose just in their towels and Bayern Munich flip flops with Wagner even holding a mop. Kimmich, Hummels and Muller all started that match as Bayern romped through to the German Cup final – with the latter scoring a hat-trick. Bundesliga champions Bayern, who face Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals next week, enjoyed a sensational start and completely overran their opponents, scoring twice through star striker Robert Lewandowski in the opening nine minutes. The Poland forward flicked in a powerful Javi Martinez shot to put the visitors ahead in the third minute and then added another goal with a fine volley from a Franck Ribery cross. Leverkusen pulled a goal back in the 16th with a Lars Bender header and came agonisingly close to levelling minutes after the restart as they battled to get back into the match. But the home side’s hopes of a comeback were short-lived as Thiago Alcantara picked out Muller to score Bayern’s third and the Spain international slotted in the fifth after Meller had scored again from close range. The Germany forward completed his hat-trick in the 78th after Leverkusen substitute Leon Bailey had pulled another goal back for the hosts with a whipped free kick. Bayern, who won the treble in 2013, will face the winners of Wednesday’s semi-final between Eintracht Frankfurt and Schalke in the final in Berlin on May 19.
