 Charlatans and gold diggers must be flushed out of the system if Nigerian clubs are to become a force to be reckoned with on the continent. Former Chairman Heartland of Owerri Ignatius Okeahialam made the submission while reacting to massive ouster of three Nigerian clubs from the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation cup respectively. He noted that the nation’s flag bearers have become easy to predict thus portraying low quality of Nigerian football. The situation according to him is not unconnected with the presence of charlatans and gold diggers in sports administration who have neither passion nor experience to administer the game but delight only in what they can get. “Management of football has gone into the hands of people who do not have passion for the game who have no experience who cannot take the footballers as their children who cannot pamper them and at the same time remain firm but are only looking for what to get. For you to call yourself a club manager you must be passionate about the game, you must be able to identified and engage a good coach, you must go for good players with certain age bracket, you must be sincere  to the extent that if you promise to pay players one naira, you must be true to your  word.  All these add up to produce the result that makes a club a real competitor,” he submitted The proprietor of now rested Imo United, said running a football club gulps a lot of money adding that while talking about independent of clubs, government must woo companies with incentives so that they can be encouraged to support sports in the country. There are not many companies ready to support sports because they have their primary objective of coming into the country which is to do their business, but government can woo them with incentives identify with sports, ” he submitted.
