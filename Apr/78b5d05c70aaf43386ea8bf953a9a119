Security operatives in Akwa Ibom have arraigned  Emmanuel Titus Udo for allegedly blackmailing the federal lawmaker representing Uyo, Dr. Michael Enyong. Udo, who hails from Nsit Atai Local Government Area, was arraigned yesterday at a State Magistrate Court, presided over by Mrs. Agnes Ukpong. He was arrested by a team of Department of State Sevices (DSS), National Intelligence Agency (NIA) and police. The accused was alleged to have posed as a pregnant woman on Facebook with the account name of Emem Etina, claiming she was impregnated and manhandled by the lawmaker, who refused to accept the pregnancy. He also claimed the lawmaker impregnated Regina Christopher, of Itiam Etoi, in Uyo Local Government Area. The accused was slammed with a one-count charge of defamation of character. Udo was said to have generated and shared the story to the public. The defence counsel, Honesty Akpanam, prayed that the accused be granted bail. Udo was admitted to bail at N500, 000, ‘with one surety in like sum who must live in jurisdiction of the court’. Investigation showed the suspect lifted from the website of World Health Organisation ( WHO ) the picture of a pregnant woman, Esther Sabouangis, a Cameroonian, from Yaoundé, receiving treatment. He posted the picture on the fake account, claiming it was Regina Christopher, of Itiam Etoi, who he said was impregnated by Enyong.
