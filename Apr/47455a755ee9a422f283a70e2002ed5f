28 Corps members in Ebonyi state would repeat the one year compulsory service scheme National Youth Service Corps, NYSC has said. Also 17 others have their service extended between one to four months while 1, 936 passed out from the scheme in the State on Thursday. The State Coordinator of the NYSC, Mrs. Iluebbey R.E. stated this at the Unity Square in Abakaliki during the passing out parade of 2017 batch “A” Stream 1 Corps members deployed to Ebonyi State. According to her, the offences of those punished range from abscondment from service to unauthorised journeys and other miscellaneous offences. She said the measure would serve as an eye opener and a deterrent to other corps members on ground. She advised the Corps members to do all in their power to always promote the unity and integration of the country stressing that every citizen should see each other as brothers and sisters and themselves
as your brother’ keeper. “Hate speech, discrimination based on tongue, tribe and religion must be eschewed while all forms of indiscipline, corruption, bribery and nepotism must be fought to a standstill so as to move this country
forward”. Governor David Umahi represented by the Secretary to the State government, Dr.Hyginus Nwokwu charged the corps members to contribute their quota towards the unity and development of the country. He promised that his administration would continue to engage stakeholders in the education and health sectors on how best to use the Corp member to engender the socio-economic development of the state.
