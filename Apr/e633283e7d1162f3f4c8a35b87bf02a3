South Korea will unveil their roster for the 2018 FIFA World Cup on May 14, the country’s football governing body said on Monday in Seoul. The Korea Football Association (KFA) said South Korea men’s national football team head coach Shin Tae-yong would announce his roster for the 2018 World Cup at Seoul City Hall. For the 2014 FIFA World Cup, South Korea announced their 23-man squad at the National Football Centre in Paju, Gyeonggi Province. Shin is currently in the final stages of piecing together his squad. Last weekend, he was at two K League matches to watch national team players. On Saturday, Shin attended the K League 1 match between FC Seoul and Daegu FC. He went on to see the K League 2 match between Asan Mugunghwa FC and Seoul E-Land the following day. A KFA official said Shin would look closely at the performances of defenders who are with South Korean and Japanese clubs. The official added that the 49-year-old coach was scheduled to fly to Japan this weekend to watch the J1 League match between Sagan Tosu and Gamba Osaka. South Korean defender Jeong Seung-hyeon, who has been considered a back-up centre-back for the national team, plays with Sagan Tosu. South Korea are scheduled to play two friendly matches at home with the squad to be unveiled on May 14. The Taeguk Warriors will face Honduras in Daegu on May 28 and take on Bosnia and Herzegovina three days later in Jeonju, North Jeolla Province. They will then fly to Austria to play against Bolivia on June 7 and Senegal on June 11 to fine-tune their preparations for the World Cup. Shin’s side will move to St. Petersburg in Russia, where its World Cup base camp is located, on June 12. South Korea are in Group F at the 2018 World Cup with Germany, Sweden and Mexico. NAN
