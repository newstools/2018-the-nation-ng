Senator Solomon Olamilekan Adeola, chairman of Senate Committee on Local Content, on Saturday said his attention has been drawn to political campaign posters being posted overnight in some parts of Ogun State, purporting to announce the commencement of his campaign for the Ogun State governor in 2019. He dissociated himself completely from the posters describing them as the ill conceived and ill- motivated gimmick of his political opponents to portray him in bad light. Adeola said the posting of such posters is clearly a breach of the Electoral Law of Nigeria and against the timetable of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for which such poster pasting is a contravention. Senator Adeola said that currently what is going on in Ogun State are consultations among relevant stakeholders on Ogun 2019, adding that he remains the duly elected senator of Lagos West and will continue to represent them fully in all ways. “As a law abiding citizen and a law maker of over 14 years standing presently serving at the highest legislative body in Nigeria, I am not one to be seen to break any law of Nigeria in pursuit of any political or other goals. By the electoral law of Nigeria it is illegal for any aspirant for elections in 2019 to begin political campaign as portrayed in the planted poster of me springing up in parts of Ogun State,” the senator stated.
