Injured Brazil forward Neymar will return “well prepared” at the World Cup, team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar says. Lasmar operated on the Paris Saint-Germain striker’s broken foot in March. “Neymar is training very well. He is recovering in the best possible way, within the framework of the defined programme we have set out for him,” the doctor told Brazil’s GloboEsporte.com late on Friday, adding he will “return well prepared” for the World Cup. Brazil is among the favourites for June and July’s tournament in Russia. The newsmen reports that Neymar on March 4, left hospital after undergoing a “successful” operation on his injured right foot. The Paris Saint-Germain forward fractured his fifth metatarsal during his side’s 3-0 defeat of Marseille in Ligue 1 on Feb. 25. NAN
