 Bayern Munich secured a record sixth successive Bundesliga title thanks to a 4-1 win away to Augsburg on Saturday. Jupp Heynckes’ men could have won the title with last weekend’s 6-0 Klassiker crushing of Borussia Dortmund had Schalke not beaten Freiburg, but there was to be no denying them this time around. Bayern, though, were given a scare when a Niklas Sule own goal put Augsburg ahead before Corentin Tolisso, James Rodriguez, Arjen Robben and Sandro Wagner turned the game on its head to spark wild celebrations come the final whistle. The triumph extends their own record of successive Bundesliga titles, which started in 2012-13, the final season of Heynckes’ last spell in charge. While that title race came after a real tussle with Dortmund, on the face of it this season has been rather more straightforward. But the campaign began poorly under Carlo Ancelotti, whose tenure at the end was mired by suggestions he had lost the support of key members in the dressing room. At that time, Dortmund looked set to give Bayern a run for their money, but Heynckes made his return for a fourth spell in charge at the start of October and they have not looked back since. While Dortmund’s challenge soon tailed off and Peter Bosz was dismissed, Bayern went from strength to strength and have lost just twice – to Borussia Monchengladbach and RB Leipzig – in the league since Heynckes’ return.
