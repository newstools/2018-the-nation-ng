Kogi State University students on Monday protested the death of a fellow student, Comrade Offor Israel, a fresh graduate from the faculty of Agriculture. The student was reportedly killed in a motor accident that occurred on the Ankpa-Lokoja road, Anyigba.  He was said to have been hit by an upcoming vehicle when he was trying to cross the road leading to the school. On hearing his death, students of the institution were reported to have  staged a protest at the school gate. Ameh Nissi, a student of Mass Communication who witnessed the accident, told The Nation that the student was hit by an upcoming vehicle when he tried crossing. In his reaction, Onuh Destiny, a fellow lodge mate of the deceased says, ” I am still filled with disbelief… someone we had breakfast together this morning. Lumio lodge is down!” According to Jeff Friday, the CEO of KSU Newsline told the students on his facebook page to stay calm over the issue. “All students are advised to stay calm and not to put law into their hands. Return to your hostels and lodge. “As any further misconduct can lead to total shut down of this current academic section which in turn can risk your own admission as well,” he warned. Attah Amos, one of the SUG aspirants described the death as a painful exit and ceases the opportunity to call  the students’ attention to a Student Union Government that will bring about a positive change. “The above incidence I must say, is another pain we feel for not having a well defined Student Union Government. If only we had a functional SUG, our deceased comrade would have received a well deserved parade. “I would like to solicit to all concerned persons to arise and listen to our plea and give the students a chance to have a body that can stand tall to defend and speak for them in the face of crises. “May the Almighty accept your gentle soul Uncle Israel and grant your family the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss,” he said.
