THE Lagos State Government  has achieved 95 per cent completion of the ongoing Blue Line rail construction covering Mile 2  to Marina, Commissioner for Transportation Ladi Lawanson said yesterday. He spoke at the ongoing ministerial briefing in Alausa, Ikeja. The construction, he said, had been focused on the National Theatre-Marina segment which has attained 65 per cent completion. “We have achieved 95 per cent completion of the blue line rail in Lagos State and currently we are focusing on National Theatre-Marina segment. “Ongoing works include boring of piles, construction of pile caps, pre-inspection of pier positions to determine underground utilities as well as boring of piles across the Lagoon,” Lawanson said. According to him, all bailey beams have been completed at Marina while fabrication of steel cages and casing, painting of reinforcement with anti-rust, seawall strengthening and the removal of shipwrecks in the lagoon are on course. The commissioner said the state through Lagos State Metropolitan Area Transportation Agency (LAMATA) had procured a Single Electric Unit (EMU) rolling stick of 2T+2M. This, he said, was in line with the current thinking of the environment, adding the EMU is already on site awaiting final testing and certification. Lawanson said the state had received the Right of Way approval from the Federal Government for the 37-km Agbado-Marina rail routes.
