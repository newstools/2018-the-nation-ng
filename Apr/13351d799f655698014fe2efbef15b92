Nigeria national-teamer Henry Onyekuru has emerged unscathed from his first game after returning to training and this will certainly be good news for manager Gernot Rohr. After a long rehabilitation, the Everton loanee played the last thirty minutes for Anderlecht Reserves in their 4-1 win against Lokeren in the Reserve Pro League on Tuesday night. Though Henry did not get on the score-sheet, he showed he has not lost his pace and was involved in the build up to the fourth goal scored by Nelson Azevedo Janelas. Emilio Ferrera’s boys responded to falling behind by scoring through Milan Corryn and Osman Bukari before their Nigerian striker helped to increase their lead. Henry hopes to be included in Nigeria’s World Cup squad list but the tournament might come too soon for the former Eupen teen sensation. As a result of a serious knee injury he suffered at the end of last year in a Belgian First Division A clash against his former club, the striker has not featured in a competitive match for Anderlecht and for that level of competition as the World Cup he will not be in tip-top condition.
