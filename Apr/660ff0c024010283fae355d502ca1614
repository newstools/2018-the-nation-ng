The Ondo State Command of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) wants passengers to caution drivers against reckless driving during and after the Easter festival. The Deputy Sector Commander and Head of Operations, Mr Olusegun Ogungbemide, says  it is imperative for the FRSC to advise the public on the necessity of cautioning drivers against reckless driving in view of the spate of carnage on the road. He spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). “It is not just about drivers alone, members of public also have responsibilities as passengers in any vehicle,” Ogungbemide said. “Passengers should caution drivers tactfully anytime they notice recklessness without distracting the drivers. It is the passenger’s responsibility to advise driver to keep to safety rules. “Data available to us has confirmed that passengers are always the victims anytime there is a crash, while drivers most of the time escape unhurt. “That is why passengers should always be proactive anytime they are in transit so as not to allow their life to be wasted by reckless drivers, especially during festivities.” Ogungbemide said the command had deployed men of the corps to critical areas of the state, especially highways, to ensure smooth Easter celebration. Accordingly the command has stationed emergency ambulances in such critical areas as Akure, Owo and Ikare Akoko axis in case of crashes. He said FRSC personnel “are working day and night to make sure that crashes do not happen and eventually if it happened, our men are expected to be there within 15 minutes to rescue victims.” He also said the command had removed vehicles parked on highways, asking that “if there is anyone we have not removed, we are pleading with the public to reach out to us immediately.” He announced that the command was carrying out “Operation No Mercy” to enforce traffic rules and regulations across the state.
