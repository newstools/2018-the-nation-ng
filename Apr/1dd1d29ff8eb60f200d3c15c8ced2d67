Popular action movie, Fast and Furious animated series, would be airing on Netflix in days to come. According to reports, Fast and Furious is expanding its franchise as part of an ongoing multi-year deal with DreamWorks Animation Television. Variety reports state that Netflix has ordered an animated series based on the popular movie. The show will follow Tony Toretto who walks in the footsteps of his cousin Dom after he and his friends are recruited by the government to ‘infiltrate an elite racing league serving as a front for a nefarious crime organization bent on world domination.’ “We are excited to extend and expand our successful relationship with Netflix by not only delivering more high-quality DreamWorks programming but connecting fans of Universal films with fascinating new stories,” Margie Cohn, president of DreamWorks Animation Television said. “Our new home at Universal marks an exciting new chapter for storytelling at our studio, and Fast & Furious is only the beginning.” The franchise is also working on a spin-off of the film that will have Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham play lead. With the plot still being worked on, the spinoff is set to be released July 26, 2019 while the Netflix animation is still in the making.
