The Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property (SPIPRPP) led by Okoi Obono-Obla, has sacked Victor Uwajeh as the panel’s special investigator. Uwajeh, a Chief Investigator of the United Kingdom-based Global Private Investigators, was engaged by the panel in March to help “track and recover stolen funds stacked in the UK by past and present public officers in Nigeria.” The panel announced Uwajeh’s disengagement through a letter sent to him via e-mail on April Friday. The letter with reference number SPIP/LR/2018/Vol. 1/29 and dated April 23, 2018 stated that the presidential panel decided to sack him due to his alleged non-disclosure of a criminal charge pending against him before the Federal High Court in Abuja. The panel’s Chairman, Obono-Obla, who signed the letter, said it was jolted “beyond doubt” by Uwajeh’s alleged non-disclosure of the criminal case. The letter titled: “Letter of disengagement’ read, “Please refer to our letter of engagement Ref SPlP/LP/2018/28 dated March 22, 2018. “We wish to state that: “In view of the non-disclosure of the pending criminal allegation against you in Nigeria prior to your engagement as a ‘Special Investigator’ to the panel; it is the decision of the panel to revoke its engagement with you as earlier communicated vides our letter under reference. “This has jolted the panel beyond doubt and triggered needless controversy. “In the light of the above, I hereby withdraw your appointment forthwith as a Special Investigator to assist the panel track and recover stolen funds stacked in the United Kingdom by past and present public officers in Nigeria. “You are hereby advised to comply.” The Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation had instituted four- count charge of forgery, documents falsification, fraud and procuring forged documents against him. The court has since granted the request made by the ‎Federal government to serve criminal summons on Uwajeh through substituted means.
