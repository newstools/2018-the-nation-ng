Former Chairman, Senate Committee on Privatisation, Ayo Arise, said on Thursday that President Muhammadu Buhari deserves a second term in office to consolidate on his achievements in office. Arise, who said Buhari “is eminently qualified for eight years in office” said the President’s fate would be determined by majority of Nigerians who elected him in 2015 and not power mongers warning him not to seek re-election in 2019. Speaking with journalists, Arise, who is aspiring for the governorship seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti, promised to win the state governorship election slated for July 14 if fielded as the party’s candidate. He spoke shortly after holding a meeting with the APC Muslim Forum at his campaign headquarters along Iyin Road in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Arise canvassed the support of the Muslims in Ekiti State, promising that his administration would carry all segments of the population along in sharing of resources and positions. “President Buhari was voted overwhelmingly. It is no longer the decision of one or two or three people to say do not contest; that is for the public to decide. “I am in support of Buhari going for a second time because the man is entitled to eight years as long as his health can handle it and with what we are seeing, he has that capacity,” he said. Arise urged the APC leadership to organize a transparent and credible primary to position the party for overwhelming victory at the governorship election.
