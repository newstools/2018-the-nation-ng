Nigeria U-23 international Taiwo Awoniyi will not play again this season for Belgian First Division A club Royal Excel Mouscron due to injury and this has ended his hope of being a surprise inclusion on the Super Eagles’ World Cup roster. The Liverpool loanee was missing from Mouscron’s match day squad against Zulte Waregem (April 14) and Waasland-Beveren (April 17). Now, Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws is reporting that Awoniyi injured the hamstring during the match against KV Kortrijk and has played his last game for Mouscron as Liverpool plans to loan him out to another club next season. Since the striker will not play again this season, it is thought he has suffered a grade 2 hamstring injury.  He will miss Mouscron’s next six games in the playoffs against OH Leuven (2), Zulte-Waregem, Waasland-Beveren, Lierse and Kortrijk. The 20-year-old netted 10 goals from 31 appearances in all competitions this season and provided seven assists.
