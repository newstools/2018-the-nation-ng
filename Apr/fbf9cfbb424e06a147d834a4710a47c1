Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose has described his colleague in Abia State, Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, as a man of destiny. He urged the Abia electorate to vote him for a second term in 2019. Fayose spoke yesterday in Abia while inaugurating the  1.2 kilometre Umuatako Street in Osisioma, Aba, commercial capital of the state, built by the Ikpeazu administration. Fayose, who was in Abia on a one-day state visit, noted that Ikpeazu has performed well. He said the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) had what  it takes to improve the living standard of the people. Fayose lauded the quality of the road and standard of its drainage. He assured Ikpeazu of the continuity of his administration. “Abia people, I have come here again today to tell you that my brother, Governor Ikpeazu is a man of destiny. Anybody fighting him will fail. Those who fought him in 2015 failed, even when they went to courts, they also failed. I am urging you to vote him again in 2019 so that he will continue and conclude the work he is doing for you. “I have seen the kind of roads he is building for you, they are of high standard with quality drainage both sides, that is how to build a road and that is what Governor Ikpeazu is doing. Keep supporting him and our party the PDP. Don’t allow blackmailers and corruption people to come and hijack your state. Only PDP will bring development and change as Governor Ikpeazu is already doing.” Ikpeazu said his promise to inaugurate Umuatako road with streetlights was fulfilled as the lights are now functional. He explained that his government would provide residents with good projects, which is the only vehicle that drives good leadership. Also, ex-governor and senator representing Abia Central, Theodore Orji, noted that he is proud to identify with the laudable projects of Ikpeazu.
