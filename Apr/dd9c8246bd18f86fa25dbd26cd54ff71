The battle for the leadership position in the ongoing ICC World T20 Africa Qualifier gets hotter today as Nigeria confronts Ghana in the second match of the day. Earlier in the day, third and fourth place teams â€“ Sierra Leone and Gambia will slug it out as the two teams are yet to win any match in the competition. Nigeria is topping the table after their emphatic victories over Sierra Leone and Gambia. On Sunday, Nigeria continued its good run, overcoming The Gambia by 55 runs, at the Tafawa Balewa Square Cricket Oval in Lagos. In a statement by the ICC Tournament Director, Kuben Pillay, the Nigerians again batted first, and they piled on the runs, eventually notching a formidable 176 for five in their 20 overs. The star for the home side was Ademola Onikoyi, who blazed an undefeated 75 off just 55 balls. There were two massive sixes and nine fours in the free-spirited knock, as the number three took Nigeria to a place of comfort. Skipper Chimezie Onwuzulike continued his fine form, with a quick-fire 34 off just 18 balls. The total was always going to be a massive test for The Gambia, who had lost their opening match to Ghana by 58 runs. They again breached the 100 mark, thanks in main to a belligerent knock of 29 off just 16 balls by PA Hassan Faye. He struck three sixes for good measure. Nigeria sits on top of the standings, but is joined by neighbours, Ghana, who also made it two from two matches on Sunday. The Black Sticks were pushed by Sierra Leone after they batted first and racked up a total of 140 for eight. Simon Ateak was the mainstay, striking a composed 57 off 42 balls.
