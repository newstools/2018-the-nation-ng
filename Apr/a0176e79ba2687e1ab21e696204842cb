Introduction Good record keeping is essential to efficient business operations for any SMEs. It is also critical for all legal related issues. Setting up a record keeping system is not exciting and doing paperwork can be time consuming. But creating and maintaining a well-organized system is easier than fixing a poor one. Some of the records that are very essential to most SMEs are classified below: Accounting and bookkeeping records Bank records Contractual agreements Corporate records Correspondence Employee records Forms used in the business Intellectual property records Marketing and advertising records Permits and licenses Stock records Tax records Conclusion The above records are to be kept depending on whether the SME is a business name or a limited liability company. The records for the immediate past year and current year must be kept handy, while older records can be archived.  Tomi Omojuwa tomiomojuwa@gmail.com
