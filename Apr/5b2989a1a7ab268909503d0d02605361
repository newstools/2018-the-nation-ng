Nigerian sprinter, Seye Ogunlewe on Monday pleaded with President Mohammadu Buhari to invest more in sport so as to get the best in Nigerian athletes at the world stage.

The sprinter responded to the President’t message on his Twitter handle after his race. “Thank you your Excellency! Invest more in us so we can do greater things. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria,” Ogunlewe said. On Monday, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi clinched a silver medal in the men’s Shot Put, while the table/tennis men’s team also got a silver medal.
