The Kaduna State government has said the 16.5km road in Gonin Gora, Chikun Local Government Area, and the 8km dual carriage way leading to Rigasa will be completed by May 29. The dualisation of the Zaria road, Rigasa, which terminates at the train station, started in December 2016, while the Gonin Gora road project was re-awarded by El-Rufai’s administration, after the contractor engaged by the late Governor Patrick Yakowa absconded. Special Assistant to the Commissioner of Budget and Planning Commission Adamu Hayatu said the Gonin Gora project comprises 6.5km ring road and 10km of feeder roads. “We are sticking to the plan and by May 29, the road will be opened,” he said. Hayatu added that the Rigasa project has reached advanced stage and will be completed in May. He hinted that besides the dualisation of the 8km Rigasa road, the government is also working on 20km link roads in the area. Residents are delighted with the project. Mrs. Hannatu was happy they have been remembered since the demise of Yakowa, who first awarded the contract. Similarly, residents of Rigasa said El-Rufai’s coming was an answered prayer. Umar Hamshaki, who has lived in the area in the last 35 years, said: “This is the kind of governor we need in Kaduna State. We have never elected a governor like El-Rufai. We are happy with the dualisation of our major road and other projects”.
