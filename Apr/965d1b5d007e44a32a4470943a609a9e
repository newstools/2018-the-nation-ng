The Federation of Agricultural Commodity Association of Nigeria (FACAN) has urged the Federal Government to create  Special Economic Zones (SECs) for agriculture. He said this would represent the  ray of hope for a sector acclaimed to be the key to the nation’s fortunes but starved of investments. Its President, Dr Victor Iyama said the carving of certain areas as agric zones would attract sustainable industries and individuals, ready  massive  food production projects. According to him, the zones would form a major component of the government’s development plan to transform agriculture and the economy. By establishing such zones, Iyama said, the government was creating a conducive atmosphere for foreign direct investments aimed at stimulating growth in some parts of the country. He explained that many Nigerians were still engaged in primary agriculture production, stressing the need to take it to the secondary level for value addition. He said economic zones would work  as  catalysts for local people to invest in productive commercial ventures. According to him, promoting rural area-based development would yield results that will improved the living conditions of millions of rural dwellers. As a government policy, he reiterated that the area-based approach to rural development would make it possible to empower neglected social groups and turn them into key players in efforts in the areas of social inclusion, economic growth, poverty reduction. Because of the country’s huge size and economic strength, he noted that country’s agriculture and rural areas have special characteristics.
