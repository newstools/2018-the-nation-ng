A cleric, Rev. Tunde Afe, has explained that he is in the governorship race in Ekiti State to make the difference in the life of the people. Afe, who is the founding Pastor of House of Faith Christian Centre, said Ekiti should not continue to wallow in hardship, dashed hopes and missed opportunities. The cleric, who is running on the platform of the Abundant Nigeria Renewal Party (ANRP), said Ekiti is backward because of lack of preparedness and vision by those privileged to govern it. Speaking at a forum organised by the state council of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Afe said there was an urgent need to fix Ekiti and make it work for its people. He took a swipe at the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC), saying neither of the two parties can provide the answer to the problems afflicting the state. Afe said: “We cannot afford to entrust them being architects of our misfortune to take us into the dawn of a new tomorrow. “Neither the PDP nor the APC can be vehicle of change; there is a saying which is apt here. The leopard doesn’t change its spot.” He added: “Together, the time is now to throw ourselves into the ring to effect good governance and that is why I have shown my desire to serve as governor of Ekiti. “I seek your support and I know it is possible with you standing by me. I make this solemn promise: I shall give myself totally to the advancement of our interest as a people.”
