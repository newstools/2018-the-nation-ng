The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) said on Wednesday national roaming and active Infrastructure Sharing in Nigeria would end rural-urban digital divide. The NCC Executive Vice-Chairman, Prof. Umar Danbatta, stated this at a stakeholders’ forum on “Development of Framework for National Roaming and Active Infrastructure Sharing in Nigeria’’ held at Digital Bridge Institute, Lagos. Danbatta, who was represented by the Director, Spectrum Administration, Engr. Austin Nwaulunne, said national roaming had the potential of promoting seamless communication of subscribers. According to him, subscribers will be able to roam on the network of other service providers where their own service provider is unavailable or has limited network coverage. “The benefits of encouraging active infrastructure sharing can also not be overemphasized. “Not only will there be noticeable reduction in network deployment costs, the industry will also witness acceleration in the take-up of broadband services and gradual elimination of the rural-urban digital divide,’’ he said. Danbatta said NCC was committed toward ensuring the continued growth and development of the telecoms industry. NAN
