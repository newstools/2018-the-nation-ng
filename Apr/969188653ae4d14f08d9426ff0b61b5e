Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said a reported chemical attack in Syria was staged by foreign agents. A spokesman for Russia’s defence ministry accused the United Kingdom of being involved in staging the attack. The United States and France said they have proof it took place and, alongside the UK, are considering military retaliation, the BBC reports. Russia, which has military forces deployed in Syria in support of the government, has warned that Western air strikes risk starting a war. During a press briefing on Friday, Mr. Lavrov said he had “irrefutable evidence” that the attack was staged as part of a “Russophobic campaign” led by one country, which he did not name. A spokesman for Russia’s defence ministry, Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said: “We have evidence that proves Britain was directly involved in organising this provocation.” The UK’s envoy to the United Nations has called this a “grotesque, blatant lie.” The White House said it is continuing to assess intelligence and talk to its allies about how to respond to the matter.
