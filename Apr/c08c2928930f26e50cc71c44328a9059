A Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja on Monday ordered Justice Mohammed Yunusa of the Federal High Court to face trial for alleged corruption. Justice Sherifat Solebo, in her ruling insisted that the embattled judge must stand trial for corruption charges preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Justice Yunusa’s counsel, Chief Robert Clarke (SAN), had on March 9, in a preliminary objection claimed that the judge had been absolved of the corruption charges by the National Judicial Council (NJC). Citing the case of Federal Republic of Nigeria Vs Nganjiwa, Clarke had said for Yunusa’s dismissal to be valid, President Muhammadu Buhari had to give a recommendation for his suspension. But Justice Solebo disagreed with the submission of the counsel and ordered the judge to defend the charges against him. The judge dismissed the preliminary objection raised by the defence counsel against the trial of Justice Yunusa. She insisted that the court has jurisdiction to hear the charges filed against the judge by the EFCC.
