The General Overseer of the Mountain of fire and Ministries (MFM), Dr. Daniel Olukoya, has said the greatest conflict Nigerians are facing presently is war against satanic witchcraft. He stated this at the monthly “Power Must Change Hands” conference held at the Prayer City, Ogun State, on Saturday. He said: “Anywhere you see any bloodshed or massive death of people it is not terrorism but the work of satanic witchcraft.  An evil force is the one behind all those bloodshed” “Do you expect a sane human being to just slaughter another human being who is still alive when he will even think twice when killing a hen or cow? “Nigerians need to wake up from their slumber as there is a massive resurgence of witchcraft all over the world. Nigeria is in the era of the great wrath where so many mysterious things have occurred; I mean unexplainable sexual perversion, unavoidable terrorism, emergence of kidnappers who are hungry for blood and terrible accidents. “I urge all Nigerians to watch and pray and be vigilant as we are in the end time. So many things are happening.”
