Kano state government has debunked insinuations that the N4.5billion Dangi roundabout underpass-flyover project was not people-oriented or ill-conceived. According to a statement signed by the state Commissioner for Information and made available to journalists, the insinuation is a semblance of, “stark ignorance of the inner workings of government and an attempt by some selfish individuals to discredit the people-oriented Dangi Roundabout underpass  flyover construction project through unsubstantiated allegations.” The statement added  that, “the project, which foundation stone laying was performed by Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje at a ground breaking ceremony, was approved at the 111th state Executive Council Meeting, and is aimed at ensuring the provision of good road networks that will curtail chaotic traffic situation in the city. “Unfortunately,  according to the commissioner, some disgruntled elements in our midst who are serving the interest of a political cult in the state, are hell bent on creating confusion by accusing the government of executing the gigantic project outside budgetary allocation.” The commissioner pointed out that one Hamisu Magaji who is playing such cards by hiding under the garb of a fictitious organisation and a member of one of the opposition parties in the state, ought to have dig out to find how the government intends to execute the project that also seeks to reduce carbon emission and minimize road accidents among others. ‘’Contrary to Magaji’s false claim that the project is not captured in the 2018 budget, we make bold to give a breakdown on how fund made for that project is going to be sourced,’’ he said. Malam Garba  further stated that the project, which has a total contract sum of over N4 billion, consists of two construction works that involves an underpass with a total contract sum of N3, 032, 483, 760.81 for which  the sum of N150 million has been set aside in the 2018 budget, while the contract sum for the construction of the flyover is put at N1, 446, 101, 082.25. He, however, said that already, the state Ministry of Works, Housing and Transport had requested from the Ministry of Planning and Budget an Authority to Incur Expenditure (AIE) for the balance total contract sum for the construction of the underpass, while the contract sum for the construction of flyover, which is captured in a supplementary budget, which is in the process of being sent to the state House of Assembly for approval and passage. Malam Garba noted that while the Ganduje Administration welcomes constructive criticism aimed at moving the state forward, it will not fold its arms and observe people in dire need of attention to not only discredit it for their selfish motives and also distract its attention from carrying out the mandate for which it was elected. To this end, the commissioner adds, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice is studying other allegations made by Magaji, who addressed a press conference over the funds he claimed were spent during the official visit of President Muhammadu Buhari and the wedding ceremony of the daughter of Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje. While calling the people not to allow themselves to be used by self centred politicians, Malam Muhammad Garba also calls on the people to always dig out for fact and double check them before making any public statement in the interest of peace and development.
