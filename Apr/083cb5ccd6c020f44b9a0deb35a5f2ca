The Enugu U-18 football team for the upcoming National Grassroots Sports Festival in Abuja, on Wednesday defeated Rangers Feeders 2-1 in a friendly match in Enugu. Following the victory, the team’s coach Anistar Izuikem, told the newsmen that his team would do well and probably win the football event of the festival. “Apart from Rangers Feeders team, we recently defeated another Nationwide League One ( NLO ) side, Lamray FC and they are a force to be reckoned with. “I feel honoured to have outwitted the two clubs in the test matches and besides, we are going to the festival with positive results,’’ the coach said. He added that the players were ready for the festival and would win the football trophy, just like the state had been doing in grassroots football competitions. The newsmen reports that Rangers Feeders dominated the match and took the lead before the interval through Kenechukwu Okolie. The U-18 team, however, equalized through their Captain Chidera Pius in the 57th minute after an enterprising buildup. The team’s leading goal scorer, Promise Eze, eventually took the match beyond Rangers Feeders, by scoring the winning goal in the 87th minute. Izuikem told the newsmen that 18 players and three coaches would be making the trip to Abuja. He said the team would depart Enugu on Thursday, instead of Wednesday the earlier scheduled day for departure. NAN
