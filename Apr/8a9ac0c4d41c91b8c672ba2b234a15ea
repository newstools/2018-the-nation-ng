AN Abuja Federal High Court has fixed June 5 for judgment in a suit seeking to compel the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, to provide information on the amount the country spent on President Muhammadu Buhari’s treatment in London last year. Justice John Tsoho chose the date yesterday after parties adopted their final written addresses and made their final submissions. Chukwuwike Okafor, counsel for the applicant, the Incorporated Trustees of Advocacy for Societal Rights Advancement and Development Initiative (ASRADI), urged the court to discountenance the respondents’ argument and grant his client’s reliefs. Babafemi Durojaiye, counsel for CBN and its governor – the first and second respondents – prayed the court to dismiss the suit. He argued, among others, that the applicant’s grievance was misdirected. ASRADI had filed the suit last year following the alleged failure of the CBN and its governor to respond to a Freedom of Information request on what the bank released for the payment of Buhari’s treatment in London. The group stated that the apex bank and Emefiele refused to honour its Freedom of Information request contained in a letter dated October 19, 2017, for information on the amount released for Buhari’s medical treatment in London and the amount paid on behalf of the Federal Government as parking fees for keeping the presidential aircraft and crew in the UK while the President’s treatment lasted. The group wants the court to declare that the failure of the respondents to provide it with information it sought through “amounts to a wrongful denial of information and is a flagrant violation of the provisions of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act 2011”. The applicant hinged its prayers on the ground, being a civil society organisation, that advocates for public interest issues and engages in anti-corruption and other related campaigns, was entitled to the information sought under the FOI Act.
