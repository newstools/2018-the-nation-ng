Senator Magnus Abe (Rivers Southeast) has formally declared to contest for Rivers State governor on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). He opened his campaign office, tagged: “Freedom House,” at 21/23 Evo Road, GRA Phase II, Port Harcourt. Abe, who is confident of winning the primaries, however, promised to support whoever becomes the party’s flagbearer. He alleged of plots by some party leaders to manipulate the congresses, vowing that this will be resisted. Abe said he is contesting to bring about change in governance. He said: “This office will be called Freedom House. A place where good things will happen; a place where ideas will be articulated and debated; a place where visions that will change Rivers State will be articulated. “I, Magnus Ngei Abe, have decided in the interest of our state, and future of our people, to seek the nomination of my party, the APC, for the office of the governor in 2019. “In doing so, I want to make it clear that there is no gunshot ambition. I assure the party and Rivers people that if there is a fair process during the primary, leading to emergence of any other person than Senator Abe, I will not only support the candidate, but will campaign for him. I will do so when party members are allowed to elect without intimidation and undue threats.”
