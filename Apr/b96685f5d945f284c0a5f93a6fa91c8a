A suspected member of Aiye cult, Adebayo Ahmed, was yesterday remanded at Ikoyi Prison for allegedly stabbing his neighbour, Samuel Owawu, to death. Ahmed was arraigned before Justice Olabisi Akinlade on a one count charge of murder. Ahmed was alleged to have stabbed Owawu to death with a broken bottle over a phone belonging to an alleged gay friend of the deceased. According to the State Prosecutor, Monisola Oshibogun, the incident occurred on the January 16, 2016 at Oyemekun Bus stop, in Ifako Ijaiye, a suburb of Lagos. She told the court that the deceased and his friend, Emeka Uche, invited a man identified as Francis to their house and he made sexual advances,  which were resisted. The prosecutor said the deceased raised the alarm and a crowd gathered at the residence and started beating the alleged gay man. She said it was at this point that Ahmed and some his friends, suspected to be members of the same cult group, started demanding for the release of the gay man’s phone. The deceased objected, insisting that the phone which had some videos showing Francis engaging in sexual acts with other men, would be tendered as evidence to the police. The prosecutor alleged that Ahmed engaged the deceased in a fight, and in the process he picked up a broken bottle and stabbed him in the chest. She said the deceased was rushed to the Ifako Ijaiye General Hospital where he later died. She said Ahmed was apprehended and handed over to the police. Justice Akinlade ordered that he be remanded in prison. She adjourned the matter till May 30 for trial.
