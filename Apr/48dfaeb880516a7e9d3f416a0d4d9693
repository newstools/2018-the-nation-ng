The Rotary club of Gbagada South, has inaugurated projects at Lagos Mainland Primary School Onayade, Fadeyi lagos state. The projects which includes renovation of six classrooms and donations of six white wax boards brought about joy among the pupils of the school. The inauguration program had in attendance some  senior members of Rotary International District 9110, including its Governor Dr Wale Ogunbadejo and the South President, Rotary Club of Gbagada Ademola Olutusin. Olutusin, who happens to be an alumnus of the school,  said he was glad to return to the school he left in the 70s. He however decried the infrastructural decay in his alma mater, putting the blame at the footsteps of the government. Olutusin urged the government not to neglect the school, adding that schools as molders of the young play a big role in the society. While Inaugurating the classrooms, Ogunbadejo who also expressed dismay at level of decay in the school, encouraged the management of the school to maintain the facilities. He recalled that he was a pupil of the school between 1965 and 1970.  He also promised to partner other alumni of the school to do more to restore its lost glory. The pupils were not only glad for the good job done by Rotary, but were happy to learn that former pupils of the school championed the work. The school’s Head teacher Mr A. A. Akinnagbe thanked Rotary for the gesture. He further asked for toilets and a sick bay urging them not to turn down the requests.
