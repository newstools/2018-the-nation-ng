•As Downpour destroy buildings Following protests by students of the College of Medicine, University of Ibadan, management of the institution yesterday shut the Alexander Brown Hall of the College. The management said the move was imperative in view of the security threat the students’ action may pose. Students of the college had during the week staged a protest following the upward review and introduction of the professional training fees to N100, 000. A statement by the UI registrar, Olujimi Olukoya, said the decision to close the hall was reached after a meeting of the board of the College of Medicine. The closure was with immediate effect until further notice with a promise to review the situation in two weeks. The students were also directed to vacate the hall immediately. “In view of the security threat that the students’ action may pose, the board, therefore, recommended an immediate closure of the Alexander Brown Hall until further notice with a review of the situation in two weeks,” he said.

The affected properties included the Students’ Union (SU) Building, two halls of residence, Chemistry Laboratory of International School, University of Ibadan, and some others within the premises of the institution were seriously damaged.
