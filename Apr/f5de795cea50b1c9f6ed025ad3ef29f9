No fewer than 10 suspected prostitutes were arrested operatives of the Kano State Hisbah Board, following raids conducted within the Kano metropolis. It was gathered that all the suspects apprehended by the state Sharia enforcer were young girls aged between 20 to 25. Spokesman of the board, Malam Umar Yakasai said the raids were carried out last week, adding that the suspected women of easy virtue were mostly not from Kano state. He explained that some of the suburbs raided by Hisbah were Badawa, Na’ibawa and Race Course. He said most of the girls arrested were spotted loitering or waiting by the roadsides apparently soliciting for their prospective customers. “Our men saw the girls waiting by the roadsides searching for potential partners to pick them up in their vehicles around 10pm. We knew they were into immoral activities from the way they dressed,” he said. Yakasai added that the agency had already charged four of the suspects to court, while the others who he said were first timers, were handed over to their parents and relatives after being admonished. He, however, called on parents and guardians to always monitor the movement and activities of their wards to prevent them from falling into immoral acts. Also,Yakasai disclosed that the board had confiscated two mini trucks filled with alcoholic beverages. He said the drivers of the vehicles and other suspects connected with the smuggling of the prohibited drinks to Kano have been taken to court. He added that the illegal drinks were being brought from Lagos, Enugu, and Oyo states.
