As the plan to hike fees at the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko (AAUA) in Ondo State heightens, the Students’ Union Government (SUG) has issued a warning: the government should address the issue within seven days; failure of which may lead to protest. This was made known in a statement by the union president, Olawale Ijanusi, who accused the government of showing no concern on the matter. Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, SAN, in his speech at the school’s last convocation, said the fees would be reviewed upward. The school resumption is being delayed amid speculation that students would return to pay new fees. The union president said: “For over 80 days, we have been made to sit at home after our examination. It is pathetic that the government has shown no concern for our predicament. The government seems unperturbed by keeping us away from school. We have wasted time doing nothing at home.” Olawale said students could no longer keep mute over the delayed resumption, stressing that actions would be taken if the government did not address the issue within seven days. He said: “The hope of our 500-Level Law students going to Law School is now hanging in the balance. We are made to go through this unpalatable experience because of the government’s secret agenda to hike the fee. “We have kept silent enough. We will not allow the government to toy with our future. We have been pushed to the wall, and it is now imperative to take our destiny into our hands. On this note, we give seven working days ultimatum to the government and also to the Governing Council of AAUA to address the fee hike and reopen our school.” “Failure of the government and the council to address the issue would draw the wrath of students. We would be left with no choice than to take to the centre stage and make ourselves heard by any non-violent means.”
