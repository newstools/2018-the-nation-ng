• Capital expenditure takes N93b The Lagos State government yesterday said its internally generated revenue (IGR) for the first quarter (Q1) of this year stood at N103.476billion, as against N96.7billion recorded in the previous year. This accounts for 81 per cent of the total revenue of N141billion generated in the quarter under review. Commissioner for Economic Planning and Budget, Mr. Segun Banjo who spoke during the annual Ministerial Press Briefing to mark the third year anniversary of Governor Akinwumi Ambode’s administration, said the records so far showed that the performance of the state’s budget 2018 of N1.046 trillion was heading in the right direction. Giving a breakdown of the figures, at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre in Alausa, Mr Banjo said the Q1 budget performance has a pro-rata size of N261.530billion and in absolute terms, it had performed N163.491billion, compared with N120.206billion reported for the same period last year. In terms of revenue generation, Banjo said N141billion (63 per cent) was generated as total revenue as against N124.141billion (77 per cent) achieved last year, adding that this year’s Q1 performance was N17.816billion higher than the previous year’s performance in absolute terms. He said out of the total revenue of N141billion, the state internally generated N103.476billion representing 57 per cent, as against N96.7billion in the previous year, thereby accounting for 73 per cent of the total revenue for the current fiscal year. The commissioner said the Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS) generated N84.1bilion during the period under review, which accounted for 81 per cent of the total revenue generated, a feat, he attributed to proper planning and research by the government. He said: “What we have said now is that in the first quarter which we just concluded of 2018, LIRS generated a total of N84 billion compared to the N74billion that was generated in 2017. Due to the research and the planning done, LIRS has been able to improve their performance and we are very glad about it.” Banjo however noted that the N84billion generated by LIRS was excluding revenue from Land Use Charge (LUC), noting that it was from the strict application of taxes from Pay As You Earn (PAYE), withholding taxes, direct assessment and other taxes. Besides, he said that Federal Transfers for Q1 contributed N38.481billion (87 per cent) compared to a performance of N27.364billion out of which Statutory Allocation contributed N13.868billion and N24.4billion from Value Added Tax (VAT) for the same period last year. “Under Capital Expenditure, Q1 performance stood at N93billion (53 per cent) as against N46.7billion (37 per cent) as at the same period in 2017. As at the end of Q1 2018, the capital: recurrent ratio closed at 57:43 as against 39:61 recorded same time in 2017. “This is a pointer to the fact that all efforts geared towards tighter control of overhead is beginning to yield fruits even though more needs to be done in this area,” he said.
