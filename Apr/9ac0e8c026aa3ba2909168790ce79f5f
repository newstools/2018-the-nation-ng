The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, on Tuesday explained why he didn’t attend the just concluded United States-Nigeria investment summit. The minister said he was not officially invited by organisers of the summit and therefore had no reason to seek clearance from the Presidency. In a statement issued in Abuja by the ministry’s Director of Information, Tolu Makinde, Ogbeh said it was imperative to address the situation following allegation levelled against him by the Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido Sanusi. The statement reads: The attention of the Federal Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development has been drawn to the statement credited to His Royal Highness, the Emir of Kano, Alhaji  Lamido Sanusi, and widely reported in the press and the social media, to the effect that some serving ministers in this government including the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, failed to attend the recently held Nigeria-US Investment  Summit in Washington DC. “The inference is not correct. “The fact is that Chief Audu Ogbeh was not invited to the important meeting by the organizers; as such, there is no way he could have attended the summit in question. This explains why he did not seek the usual clearance from the Presidency to enable him attend.” “It is worth reiterating that Chief Ogbeh was in Nigeria attending to his official duties and did not travel to Washington DC with the Federal Government delegation, as he is not one of the government officials that statutorily attend the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meetings. “This explanation is necessary to reiterate the determination of the ministry to attract foreign investment into the Nigerian agricultural sector in order to attain our national agricultural objectives, as well as correct any wrong perception of tardiness, lack of seriousness or dereliction of duty that the said story is capable of creating in the minds of the public.”
