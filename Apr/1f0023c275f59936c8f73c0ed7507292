The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday docked telecommunications firm, Globacom Limited, before the Lagos State Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja for alleged $6,786,674.61 fraud. The company’s Chief Marketing Officer, Ashok Israni, was listed as the first defendant in the case. But Israini has been granted administrative bail by the Commission. The EFCC counsel, Mr. A.B.C. Ozioko, who signed the charge sheet, Globacom and Israni acted contrary to Section 1(2)(3) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Fraud Related Offences Act No. 14 of 2006. However, defendants were not in court on Monday. Ozioko said the EFCC was making efforts to produce the defendants in court. “My lord, we are sorry we are not able to produce the defendants. “As part of efforts to ensure that trial commences, we brought the complainants all the way from Dubai. “We have no choice but to seek a date for arraignment,” he said.
