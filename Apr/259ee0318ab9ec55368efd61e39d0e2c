The students numbering over 1,000 blocked major roads in the town, thereby preventing vehicular and human movements for several hours. The protest affected social and commercial activities in many parts of the town, as many shop owners hurriedly closed their shops, even as commercial drivers boycotted the roads. The students converged at the Oja Oba junction in the heart of Akure and condemned the sudden hike in their tuition from N25,000 to N180,000/N200,000. They accused the State Government of being callous alleging that the action of the government was against the economic realities in the state. The AAAU students were also at the popular Adegbola Newspapers Distribution Centre, Fiwasaye, Cathedral and Adegbemile area amongst others chanting various anti-government songs with placards. They were however dispersed with teargas by the anti-riot policemen deployed to curtail the protest. They were led on the protest by the Chairman, National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Ondo axis, Adewumi Adebowale who insisted that the students will not pay the new tuition. Adebowale said the new tuition introduced into the university by the state government was outrageous. He also promised to do everything to resist the hike. He urged the students not to resume academic activities until the State Government or the Universityâ€™s management, reverse the tuition. Reacting to the new development, President of the Students Union Government (SUG) of the University, Ijanusi Olawale said no student of the university would pay the new tuition. He declared that the university will not be opened for academic session unless the state government reverts back to the old tuition, saying the new tuition cannot be afforded by their parents. He urged the students to remain calm and refuse to pay any money or resume until they hear from the leadership of the SUG,stressing that they had remained at home for three months.
