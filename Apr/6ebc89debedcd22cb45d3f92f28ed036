A State High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti has sentenced a man, Raji Babatunde, to death for armed robbery. Justice Cornelius Akintayo in a judgment delivered on Wednesday held that the prosecution has proved the case against the accused beyond reasonable doubt. He, however, discharged and acquitted the second accused person, Adegboye Sunday, due to lack of sufficient evidence against him. None of the witnesses called to give evidence in the case linked the second accused person to the commission of the crime leaving the court with no option than to set him free. Babatunde was arraigned on two-count charge of armed robbery.
