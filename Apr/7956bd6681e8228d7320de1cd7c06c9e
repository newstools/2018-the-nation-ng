Uber Technologies Inc on Tuesday launched a new app for its drivers that includes real-time earnings tracker, the latest effort by the ride-hailing service to improve an often contentious relationship. The move followed Uber’s ‘180 days of change’ programme that was launched in June to make changes requested by drivers, such as tipping and compensation for time spent waiting for passengers. Its Chief Executive Officer, Dara Khosrowshahi, said in a statement that “while 180 days was about correcting missteps of the past, we also needed to think longer term, and the obvious place to start was the Driver app.” According to Khosrowshahi, the new app will introduce new status bar to help drivers to decide their next location based on a spike in requests. He added that “the new app will also introduce notification feature that allows drivers to see messages about upcoming earnings opportunities and feedback from riders, among other things.” Uber in 2017 outlined series of improvements for drivers, including new navigation system and fairer approach to review performance in response to years of complaints by drivers about their pay and treatment. Uber drivers are independent contractors, not employees, and lack paid sick leave and vacation, and must pay for car maintenance and other costs. The company, which is preparing for a potential initial public offering in 2019, lost 4.5 billion dollars in 2017 and is facing fierce competition at home in the U.S. and across Asia, as well as a regulatory crackdown in Europe.
