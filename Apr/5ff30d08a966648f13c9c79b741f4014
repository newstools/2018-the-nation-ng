Oil prices hit their highest level since early December 2014 after United States President Donald Trump warned Russia to prepare for a strike on its ally, Syria. Crude futures also tacked on gains following a strike on top oil exporter Saudi Arabia by rebels in neighboring Yemen. Brent, the benchmark for international oil prices, were at $72.14 a barrel, up $1.10, or 1.6 per cent from Tuesday’s closing price. The contract earlier rose to $73.09, the highest level since Nov. 28, 2014, when it hit $73.41. U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was up $1.31, or two per cent, to $66.82. WTI rose as high as $67.45, a session peak going back to Dec. 4, 2014, when it touched $68.22. Analysts say this is a good development for Nigeria, Africa’s largest oil producer. President Muhammadu Buhari had on November 7 last year, presented a N8.612 trillion budget proposal to a joint session of the National Assembly. Buhari also proposed an oil price benchmark of $45, exchange rate of N305/$1, oil production target of 2.3 million barrels/day, inflation rate of 12.4 per cent, and a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 3.5 per cent. John Kilduff, founding partner at energy hedge fund Again Capital, earlier yesterday said U.S. crude prices could be heading to $70 after breaking through the previous 2018 high of $66.66. The morning price spike was completely due to the Trump tweet, which left the market to parse the president’s meaning, according to Kilduff. The question, he said, is whether Trump will order the military to solely target Syrian assets, or take aim at Iran, which also backs Assad and has a significant presence in Syria. Such an attack would come just one month before Trump faces a deadline that could see him restore sanctions on Iran, Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC’s) third largest oil producer. Kilduff said: “That’s the crux of the matter. Is it a pin prick or is it something that sets us up for escalation?”
