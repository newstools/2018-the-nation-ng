Have you ever found yourself climbing towards your goals only to trip and find yourself back down at the bottom of the mountain? That’s because, without knowing it, you let the forces of evil distract you and then seep into your daily ways of thinking. Note: By “forces of evil” you can interpret that in any way you like whether: Disney villains, human nature, the Devil, inner demons, etc… You still have the ability to choose your actions and own your life responsibility
