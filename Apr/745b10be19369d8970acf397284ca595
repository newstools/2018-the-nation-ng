Big Brother Housemate, Tobi Bakre, has said he enjoys bold ladies who reach out to men. Tobi said this while conversing with Alex, Miracle and Anto in the garden. He said he was out for a drink when a lady slipped her card into his pocket, motioning him to call her. “This lady who was obviously hanging out with her friends reached out to me by putting her card in my pocket. “She was yo, I am hanging with my friends but will like you to reach out.” This was few minutes before he travelled to South Africa for the Big Brother Naija show. Tobi however, promised to reach out to the lady. Reacting to the incident, Miracle said, “I like it when ladies reach out. It shows that they are bold.” Miracle also gave his own account of a lady who stalked him in a mall. Alex and Anto, obviously enjoying the conversation grinned in laughter. Meanwhile, Tobi also disclosed that his mum was still waiting for him to bring home a wife.  He talked of a particular lady he refused to tie the knot with. “Her name is Omotunde,” Tobi said. “I should have gotten married to her but I didn’t see the process through. Everybody knows about this in the family, even her sister as well.” Tobi quickly made a shoutout to Omotunde, saying he wished things went the way it should have. Anto, however was quick to warn him that people outside are crazy. “They sent me the handle of the person Lolu was involved with. They would have googled this lady right now, even if it were as little as a nickname,” She said. Tobi had earlier on told Alex that he hated being pressured into a relationship. “I am still young and hustling,” said Tobi. “Some days I get money, and other days I don’t. Sometimes I don’t just want to converse with anybody.” He told Alex that this behaviour of his made him lose very good-natured ladies like Bukky, his friend before he entered into the house.
