The apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, said on Friday it is not against President Muhammadu Buhari’s decision to seek re-election in 2019. The group said the President has the constitutional right to seek re-election. The media aide to the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Emeka Attamah, said although “the Ohanaeze Ndigbo does not comment on purely political issues, but in this regard the organization is not against President Buhari because he has the constitutional right to seek a second term in office.” According to him, the President has his score and it is left for Nigerians to judge him from his scorecard. “If they find him worthy through his scorecard, they can vote for him and re-elect ‎him or vice versa,” he said.
