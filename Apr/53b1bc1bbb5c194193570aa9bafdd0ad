Cristiano Ronaldo thanked Juventus fans who applauded his stunning bicycle kick goal for Real Madrid against the Italian side on Tuesday. The Portugal forward also said he had been hoping for a long time to score in such spectacular fashion. “Obviously people are talking about my second goal….it was a spectacular goal, possibly the best of my career,” he said in a video posted on several Spanish websites after the Champions League tie in Turin. “I scored once for the national team with a bicycle kick, which hit the post and went in, but this was a bit better. “I had been looking to score a goal like that for a long time but it depends on the circumstances of the match. Sometimes, it doesn’t work, but you always have to try. I tried and I scored,” said Ronaldo. The goal, second in Real’s 3-0 win in the quarter-final first leg, was scored when the Real Madrid forward met Dani Carvajal’s cross with an incredible overhead kick, and was applauded by the home fans. “This was one of the nicest moments. To be applauded by the Juventus stadium, where so many great footballers have played, it’s a top moment for me. “It’s something that stays in your heart…I want to thank all the Italians who were here in the stadium and applauded me,” Ronaldo said.
