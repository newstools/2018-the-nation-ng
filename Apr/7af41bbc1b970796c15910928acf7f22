Morison Industries Plc has listed the supplementary shares that were allotted during its recent rights issue, rounding off the offer process for the N502.2 million rights issue. A total of 836.98 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each were added to the shares outstanding in the name of Morison Industries. With the supplementary listing of 836.98 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each, the total issued and fully paid up shares of Morison Industries has now increased from 152.18 million to 989.16 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each. Morison Industries had raised N502.2 million new equity funds, providing the 63 years old health care company with the much-needed boost to reposition its operations. Morison Industries had late last year floated a new capital raising for about N502.2 million in new equity funds through new share sale to its shareholders. The company offered a rights issue of 836.98 million ordinary shares of 50 Kobo each at 60 Kobo per share on the basis of 11 new ordinary shares for every two ordinary shares of 50 Kobo held as at last August 25. GTI Securities Limited acted as the stockbroker to the supplementary share issuance while GTI Capital Limited was the issuing house. Both GTI Securities and GTI Capital are members of the GTI Group – a leading financial services group that owns the largest private trading floor in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The allotment results for the rights issue approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) showed that the rights issue was oversubscribed by 1.12 million ordinary shares as shareholders took up their rights and demanded for additional shares. As against 836.98 million shares placed on offer, shareholders placed orders for 838.11 million ordinary shares. GTI Capital Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Kehinde Hassan said the success of the rights issue had further confirmed GTI Capital’s pedigree of packaging companies to raise capital, irrespective of the macroeconomic and market conditions.
