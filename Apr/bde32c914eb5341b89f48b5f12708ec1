Mauricio Pochettino has called on Tottenham to replicate their performances in the resounding Wembley wins over Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United. The Spurs manager believes his squad now has more big-game experience than a year ago, when they lost 4-2 to Chelsea in last season’s semi-final, but he warned that it will count for nothing if they do not perform against Jose Mourinho’s side. Spurs beat Dortmund and European champions Real 3-1 and Liverpool 4-1 at temporary home Wembley in Autumn and Pochettino believes those performances are the benchmark for his team tomorrow. “We have the belief that we can beat many teams, and we have more experience [than last year],” Pochettino told Standard Sport. “But I don’t believe that is going to be the key to winning the game. Sure, we have a different level of experience now and that’s always an important thing. But we need more than experience and maturity to win on Saturday. “The most important thing is the performance. If we are able to perform in the way we performed against Real Madrid, Dortmund and Liverpool at home, I think we’re going to compete. If not – with or without experience – it’s going to be difficult.”
