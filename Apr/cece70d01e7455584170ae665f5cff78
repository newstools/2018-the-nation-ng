 *deducts three points *orders team to play behind closed doors Premier league contenders Heartland of Owerri have been handed a fine of N4million by the League management committee (LMC) following the attack on match officials by fans of the club in the tie between Heartland and Plateau United. A breakdown of the fine indicate that the Nazi Millionaires are to pay N1million for the attack on match officials, pay N1.5million to as compensation to match officials, another N1million for issuing public statement capable of bringing the league to dispute and N500,000 for failure to use and issue match tickets for record and crowd control purposes. Series of tweets dished out by the league Management Committee on Friday includes; “Heartland have also been fined N1m for assault on match officials after game vs Plateau Utd. The club will also pay N1.25m as compensation to the match officials “Heartland have been further fined N1m for issuing public statement capable of bringing the league to disrepute” Another N500, 000 fine will be paid by Heartland for failure to use & issue matchday tickets for record & crowd control purposes” The Owerri based club also had three points deducted from them.  But if you think that is the end of the story and the punishment you are indeed very wrong.  Team Manager Mobi Oparaku has been suspended from all NPFL activities for the next matches while the team will play the next three matches behind closed doors. Matchday 18 game at the Dan Anyiam Stadium ended 1-1 and reports afterwards indicate that hell broke loose as Heartland supporters not satisfied with the result accusing the officials of deliberately extending the game unnecessarily thus handing Plateau united the advantage of equalising. Abiodun Thompson scored in the 21st minute to give Heartland the lead before a very late equaliser by Tosin Omoyele for Plateau in the 94th minute to earn the reigning champions an away point. Centre Referee Yusuff Garba was reportedly attacked alongside other officials Akaninye Udoette as the first assistant referee, Elisha Owolabi as the second assistant referee, and Felagha Awudola as the fourth official.
