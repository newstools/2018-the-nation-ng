A politician and  legal luminary from Owerri Zone, Anambra State, Mike Ahamba (SAN), has reflected on the succession battle in the state, saying that the governor is not an exclusive right of the zone. He called for equity and justice, advising the stakeholders to adopt zoning. Ahamba, who spoke at the Owerri Unity Convention held at the Oxygen Hotel, Owerri, the state capital, stressed that the zone cannot insist on producing the next governor in next year’s election. He urged the zone to seek the collaboration with other zones in a way and manner that will foster equity and fairness. Ahamba said: “In 1999, we supported Orlu Zone for governor because we considered that they have not produced a governor yet, although we had only 18 months. Sam Mbakwe from Okigwe Zone had four years and three months. “Now that equity,  that brotherliness, that understanding of our being one state called Imo should make you people to remember us and allow us to occupy the house that is built in our compound.“ He however, advised the zone to work together in the pursuit of the ambition, warning that acts of sabotage could frustrate their efforts. Ahamba stressed: “This is our time and we must come together. We will not accept candidates that are nominated and sponsored from outside. We must come together but as we do it,  let nobody use any method that that will offend his opponent. If there is fair play in the nomination, if there is fair play in the election, there will be no problem in coming together at the end of it.” The convention was attended by Deputy Governor  Eze Madumere, frontline politician and Igbo leader Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, Senator Chris Anyanwu, Air Commodore Peter Gbujie (Retd), former Commissioner for Revenue Generation Nick Okparandudu, Leo Stan Eke, and wife of Ondo State governor  Beaty Akeredolu.
