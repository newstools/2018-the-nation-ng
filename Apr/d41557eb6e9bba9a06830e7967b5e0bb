The  National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju  Bola Tinubu, says the lingering issue of waste management in Lagos State will soon be resolved. Tinubu gave the assurance yesterday  in Lagos during a meeting with the Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria (AWAM), otherwise known as PSP. Tinubu pledged that  he would reconcile all the stakeholders in his capacity as Grand Patron of AWAM to promote the business interests of waste managers and wellbeing of Lagosians. “It is disappointing and sad that at this stage of our development, the matter should result into petition. It should have been continuity and progress. “Whatever is the shortcoming, we will correct it. This will get to the governor latest by Monday, April 30. “It is sad to see Olusosun dumpsite in dangerous smoke. As a grand patron of AWAM, I am concerned driving around Lagos and seeing built up refuse. “I must say it is a challenge that is coming back and we will not allow that to happen. “The government and governor is trying and responsive but the complexity of Lagos is compounding by the day,” he said. The former governor of Lagos State noted that AWAM members travelled abroad to learn international best practices in waste management and applied such in the state. Earlier, the Chairman of AWAM, Mr Ola Egbeyemi, said that the waste crisis had become unprecedented, with increased volume of waste on Lagos streets, roads, highways and medians. Egbeyemi, who was represented AWAM spokesman, Gbenga Adebola, said that the situation had taken Lagos back to pre-1999, when waste was competing with vehicular and pedestrian movements.
