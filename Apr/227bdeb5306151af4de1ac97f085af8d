Former Enyimba FC goalkeeper, Dele Aiyenugba has admitted that he is still open to a possible call-up to the Super Eagles as they continue the search for a regular number one goalkeeper before the World Cup. The Hapoel Ashkelon shot-stopper told AOIFootball.com that he has always remained open to the national team call-up despite being unceremoniously ousted in 2011 after Nigeria’s 2-2 draw against Guinea in Abuja, a result that meant Nigeria missed out on the 2012 AFCON. “Playing for Nigeria has always been my dream. Every time I was called upon I always gave my best and that is something I want to continue doing if given the opportunity. The events of 2011 have passed and I’m sure I can be of help if called upon. I believe the coach knows what he wants in a goalkeeper. If he feels I should return and offer my experience, I will gladly do so because I want to see Nigeria do well at the World Cup in Russia. Seven years is a long time but anything can still happen,” Aiyenugba concluded. Aiyenugba is a two-time African champion with Enyimba and was a very reliable deputy to the former captain of the Super Eagles’ Vincent Enyeama at both club and national level. He was however shown the exit door when Nigeria failed to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations in 2012.
