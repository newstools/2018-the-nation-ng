Some traders at Diobu in Port Harcourt, yesterday, appealed to the Rivers government to provide affordable stalls before enforcing its ban on street trading. They spoke to News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) following the seven-day ultimatum banning trading on Bishop Okoye Street in Diobu. According to them, it’s unfair for government to drive them out of business without providing an alternative place. A trader, Mrs Kechi Wechie, who sells vegetables, appealed to the government not to be hasty about banning trading on Bishop Okoye Street. “We are aware that we trade on the road; but we have nowhere to go from here, we implore the government to help us. “What we do here is petty trading, we will be happy to access affordable stalls with the assistance of government,’’ Wechie said. Another trader, Miss Anita Welekwe, a plantain seller, told NAN that banning trading on the street without another provision would “put food off the tables of many families’’. “Many of us trading here are the bread winners in different ways. “ I tell you that many families will go hungry if we are stopped from doing our businesses,’’ Welekwe said. Archibong Matthew, a grinding machine operator, expressed concern about the notice government has given traders to quit the street. “It is from proceeds of my activities here that I assist my younger ones in school; I pray this notice will not be enforced. “I will be the greatest victim, I wonder the excuse to give to those that depend on me, I beg the government to change its mind,’’ he said. NAN reports that some residents of Mile 3, Diobu, had appealed to the government to stop traders from selling on Bishop Okoye Street. They alleged that the traders were display fish, vegetables and other edibles in the open on the filthy street. They alleged that they had stopped buying from the  traders, for fear of being infected by disease from such items.
