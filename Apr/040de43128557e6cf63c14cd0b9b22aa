Bayelsa State Governor, Seriake Dickson, on Wednesday accused the Federal Government of not fully releasing the 13 per cent derivation to the oil-producing states as provided by the constitution. The governor insisted that oil producing states in the country were not getting the complete 13 percent derived from oil production. Dickson said despite the express provisions of the constitution for the disbursement of 13 per cent to oil producing states, persons entrusted with the responsibility had not ensured effective implementation of the derivation act. Dickson, who said successive governments had violated the 13 percent derivation act, called for the issue to be addressed without delay. According to a statement issued by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Media Relations, Mr. FIdelis Soriwei, the governor stated these when he visited the Head Office TV Continental (TVC) in Lagos. He said the queer kind of federalism in operation in the country was the reason behind the growing call for restructuring of the polity.
