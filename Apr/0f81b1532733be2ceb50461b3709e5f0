MUSIC duo, Row and Zuwa, aka ROZE are the latest singers in the Clarence Peter’s video, having made good their promise to find their space in the Nigerian music scene. The brothers have just released their debut single ‘The Whole Night’ accompanied by the video which was shot in Lagos. The song, a high-tempo sound which was officially released on all music platforms with its video on Monday, April 23, 2018 has since been enjoying rave reviews for its audio-visual quality, creativity and dope delivery. Born in Houston, Texas, January 11, 1998 and July 30, 1999 to Nigerian-American parents, the singers later relocated to Nigeria, where they had their primary and secondary school education. Once done with their secondary school education, they then moved back to Houston, Texas, where they are now studying Petroleum Engineering and Architecture at the University of Houston and Houston Community College in Texas, United States of America. The two are known in school for their passion for making beats and writing songs, until it was noticed by their father who was surprised to know how talented they were. They noted during their visit to Lagos in January: “We do pretty good music never seen before, and we have great musical stuff we’re bringing on board. When you have great stuff you aren’t scared to launch out in an industry that is complicated or crazy.” Signed to U & I Music, an entertainment platform owned by their father, the brothers have indeed hoisted a flag on the dome of the music industry with this banging entrant of a single and a video.
