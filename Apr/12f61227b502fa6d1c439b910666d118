A Danish citizen, Mr. Peter Nielsen, who was accused of killing his wife and daughter, has not been charged with any offence, his legal representatives, Primera Africa Legal (PAL), said yesterday. The Police are investigating Nielson over the death of his Nigerian wife, Zainab Ali-Nielsen, an artiste popularly known as Alizee, and her four-year-old daughter, Petra. It was alleged that they were murdered in the family’s Banana Island, Ikoyi, Lagos Island residence in the early hours of April 5. PAL’s Senior Partner, F. Boma Ayomide Alabi, said in a statement that Nielsen “is fully cooperating” with the investigators at the Lagos State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCID). She sought transparent investigation and for access to him by his lawyers, adding that the suspect has not been charged and that the cause of death was unknown. Alabi said there had been “largely inaccurate and speculative public and media narrative” against her client. “He has not been charged with any crime yet. The cause of death is still unknown. It is in the interest of justice that an opportunity is availed Mr. Nielsen to defend himself and that the investigation is transparent, factual and unbiased. “The Nigeria Police must allow Mr Nielsen access to his lawyers. In the eyes of the law, he is presumed innocent till proven guilty after an adversarial trial process. “We, therefore, plead that no one rushes to judgment and that we allow the law take its course,” the statement reads. Lagos State Police Command’s spokesman Chike Oti had said Nielsen was detained at the SCID. “The suspect is from Denmark. He has been arrested and transferred to the State CID, Panti, for thorough investigation by the Homicide Department. “The command has also written the embassy on the suspect that the police are investigating one of their nationals,” he said.
