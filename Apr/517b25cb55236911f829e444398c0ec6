Eight-time African wrestling champion, Blessing Oborududu is eyeing gold medal in her third attempt at the 2018 Commonwealth Games holding in Gold Coast, Australia. In her debut at the 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games, Oborududu settled for silver while she added a bronze medal to her haul at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games but in Gold Coast, she is aiming for the gold to complete the colours of medals at the games. The 29-year-old told NationSport at the weekend that she is primed for gold this year. “I am going for nothing less than gold medal this time around having tasted what it meant to win silver and bronze. I believe my efforts will see me through this year having competed very well in some of the major competitions within the continent this year. Nobody can stop me as I am in the right frame mind for the championship.” Since making his debut for Nigeria n 2009, Oborududu has won gold medals in all her appearances at the African Championship from 2010 and she has remained one of the most decorated wrestlers in Sub-Sahara African and heading to the Commonwealth Games, she is ready to roar against any opponent. For Coach Purity Akuh, the six-man female wrestlers have the ability to deliver less than three gold medals for Nigeria. “I am so sure that we can win at least three gold medals. It can be more than that but it cannot be less than that. Also, the six female wrestlers will win medals which I am sure of while the men will also do their best. All the wrestlers are responding well in training and they are all in good shape and form for the games,” Akuh said.
