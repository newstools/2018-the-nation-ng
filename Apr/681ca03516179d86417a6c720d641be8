The Supreme Court is set to deliver its judgement on the leadership crisis which has engulfed the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), on Thursday. Chris Giwa and his board had dragged the FIFA-recognised Amaju Pinnick-led board to the Supreme Court, to set aside the verdict of the Appeal Court after he won won at the High Court, claiming that the mandate given to him by the Congress of the NFF in August 2013 was sacrosanct. He also insists that the election in Warri that brought in the Amaju group was held in defiance of a High Court order. But the defendants have held onto the FIFA statutes in arguing their case, praying the Supreme Court in their submission that football matters must not be adjudicated in the ordinary court. They also insist the plaintiffs had been banned by the world football governing body. The Supreme Court will decide on Thursday, whether to uphold the verdict of Justice Joseph Tur of the Appeal Court in his judgment in 2016 when he held that the discontinuation of the cases on October 30, 2014, which was affirmed by the court, stood.
