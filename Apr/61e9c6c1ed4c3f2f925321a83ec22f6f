CHIEF Mrs. Teju Phillips, former Lagos State Commissioner for Special Duties and Inter-governmental Relations is in her best moments and set to host the high society. The wedding between her last child, Derin, and Xerona, the daughter of former Cross Rivers State governor, Donald Duke, is gathering momentum. The couple had already done their pre-wedding photo shoot in preparation for their D-day which, we gathered, is April 24. They had their introduction in October last year. Derin, popularly known as DJ Caise, is a banker-turned Disc Jockey while Xerona is a trained lawyer-turned guitarist.
