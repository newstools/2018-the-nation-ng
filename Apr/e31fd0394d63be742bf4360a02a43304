Following two successful outings in Maiduguri on February 24 and Yola on April 7, Simply Poetry Ltd is slated to perform its staged poetry and theatre production headlined by Dike Chukwumerije again before a Jos audience in Plateau State on April 28, 2018. The 18-member cast and crew of the ‘Made in Nigeria’ show are billed to perform at Mees Palace Rayfield Jos by 5pm. The show is poetry for stage production that tells 102 years of Nigeria’s journey from amalgamation to present day using poetry, song, dance and drama. So far, the show has been to seven cities across Nigeria, reaching close to 10,000 people with a message of empathy, love and tolerance on the journey to nationhood and the recent sponsored stop-overs at Maiduguri and Yola were part of a larger effort to encourage peace-building through developing alternative non-violent channels for the venting of grievances. The underlying message of the show, according to its creator, Dike Chukwumerije, is that ‘though tribe and tongue may differ, there is indeed a shared brotherhood, and sisterhood, rooted in the years we have shared as Nigerians and the many points of convergence this has given us.’ The ‘Made in Nigeria Show’ is a live performance poetry production company that fuses poetry with other art forms to deliver unforgettable experiences. The show was first unveiled at the Merit House, Maitama, Abuja on the 30th of September, 2016. The show has already been to cities like Lagos, Benin, Enugu, Ile-Ife and Abuja before catching the eye of a donor who sponsored the staging of the show at the University of Maiduguri on February 24, 2018 and again in Yola on April 7, 2018.
