 A 32-year old man identified as Austine Ibe has been jailed by an Oredo Magistrate Court to two years imprisonment with hard labour for stealing 75 cartons of tin tomatoes valued at N315,600. Austine was said to have committed the offence on October 14, 2017 at No 4 Butcher Street off Forestry Road Benin City. The tin tomatoes were said to have been stored at a warehouse belonging to one Paul Okafor. Austine was arraigned on a two-count charge bothering on stealing and break-in and entry. He was found guilty on guilty on both charges by the presiding Magistrate, F.E Akhere. Prosecuting Council, DSP Patrick Agbonifo, had earlier informed the court that the offenders were punishable under sections 414(1) and 390(9) of the Criminal Code 48 Vol II Laws of the defunct Bendel State of Nigeria, 1976 now applicable in Edo State.
