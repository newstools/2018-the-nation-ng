The Delta State Police Command has safely detonated a two-kilogramme improvised explosive device (IED) at the Dibi tank farm in Escravos in Warri North. Commissioner of Police Muhammadu Mustafa, who briefed reporters yesterday, said the bomb was detonated on a Chevron facility. He said his men, acting on intelligence, discovered the IED at the base of the oil pumping pipe. Mustafa said items recovered are a two-kilogramme  seismic dynamite, electric donator and 13 meters wire connected to the base of the pipe. “On  April 6, through information that hoodlums had planted suspected improvised explosive device in Chevron Escravos Flow station, the command’s IED experts were deployed to the scene. ‘’They discovered that the objects were planted at the base of the flow pump, ostensibly to cause serious damage as the petroleum products in the pipe could have caused serious conflagration on the facility.” Mustafa said pictures of the IED were beamed to headquarters, with officers giving instructions to detonate the device. He said the IED was designed to use heat emanating from the pumping pipe to set off the dynamite. Head of EOD unit said: “When I received the report, I asked the team leader on ground to assess the situation and brief me. ‘’After clarifying that there was IED on ground, I requested that pictures be uploaded to my phone and having studied it and working with my men on ground, we devised a strategy and following my instructions, we detonated the IED”.
