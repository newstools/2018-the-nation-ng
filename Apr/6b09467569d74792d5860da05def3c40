Youths in Somolu, Lagos State, have endorsed Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for a second term. The youth, at the weekend, joined others across the state to ask the governor to run for a second tenure. In a carnival-like event, they hailed the Ambode administration for giving Lagosians the dividends of democracy. The youth trooped out in large number for a walk organised to express their admiration for the governor. Party elders and well-wishers also attended the event. It was organised by friends of the Executive Chairman of Somolu Local Government, Abdulamid Salau. One of the organisers, Dele Afolabi, who is the chief of staff to the council chairman, said the essence of the walk was to identify with the successes of Governor Ambode and let the world know that Somolu youths supported his second term ambition. The APC Chairman in the locality, Femi Taiwo, sensitised Lagosians on the need to get registered during the ongoing voter registration.
