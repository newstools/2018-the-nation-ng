Super Eagles’ technical adviser Genort Rohr has stated that the Super Eagles will face Atletico Madrid in a friendly game on May 21 at the Godswill Akpabio International stadium, Uyo. The German tactician revealed on Supersport Monday night football that the CHAN Eagles or selected home-based players would be used to prosecute the match, as he ruled out the possibility of using Eagles big stars for the game. He also said the team will use the game to thank the state government under Governor Udom Emmanuel, as well as the good people of Uyo, for their support to the Super Eagles during their World Cup campaign. “The date for the match is May 21. If they (Atletico Madrid) are coming to Nigeria for the match, it will be a good one for us. But I don’t know yet which team would play against Atletico Madrid. It maybe CHAN Eagles or selected local-based players but the main Eagles players will not be part of it. I love the game to be played so that we will use the opportunity to say thank you to the government, governor and people of Uyo for their support to the Super Eagles during our stay there,” Rohr said.
