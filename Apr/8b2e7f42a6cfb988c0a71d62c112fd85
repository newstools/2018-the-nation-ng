Deontay Wilder has responded to Anthony Joshua after he threw down the gauntlet in the wake of beating Joseph Parker in Cardiff on Saturday night. Joshua needed a unanimous point’s decision to defeat Parker in Cardiff and subsequently add the WBO heavyweight title to his WBA, IBO and IBF belts. And after the result was announced, Joshua, much like Dillian Whyte had done the week previous after defeating Lucas Browne, invited Wilder over to the UK as he looks to become the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. ‘Let’s go Wilder!’ AJ screamed down the television cameras as he mimicked the words of Whyte. ‘Come to London and I’ll knock you spark out.’ Now though, Wilder, who chose to watch Joshua face Parker from his home, has responded, claiming he has accepted Joshua’s many invitations in the past. In a video on Instagram, Wilder sought to take the moral high ground by quoting his grandmother. “My grandma told me if you don’t have nothing nice to say dear baby then don’t say nothing at all. That’s all I’m going to say,’ he said, before claiming Parker was robbed of the win and mocking Joshua’s tattoo of Africa. He wrote: ‘What a robbery… WOW?? @joeboxerparker Great job Bro omg don’t apologize you did nothing wrong true champion. @anthony_joshua I ACCEPTED 100%. P.S. Take AFRICA off your Arm. They’re warriors you from UK brotha’. He further taunted Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn by putting up a video of himself supposedly calling Hearn’s phone, only to be greeted by a voicemail message. Wilder added on Instagram: ‘Don’t be with that bulls*** @eddiehearn pick up the phone Maine.’ While Whyte is also eager to get his teeth into the American and WBC heavyweight champion, Joshua is clearly the only fight Wilder is interested in. It’s a bout that both the Brit and Hearn made clear was one the undefeated fighter wants to happen, and should Wilder’s claims be true, we could see the division unified before 2018 is out.
