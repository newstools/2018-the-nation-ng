Afrofolk musician Oluko has come out with his debut album tagged ‘Bowale’ which means ‘Return Home’ in Yoruba. The album which was recently released has five tracks – Good morning, Africa, Bowale (ft Alex Seun), Enu Agba (ft Mr Olanrewaju) and Tiwa n tiwa. According to Oluko whose real name is Oluseun Jacob, “the album title and the track BOWALE was actually inspired by the lady who I’ve had a crush on for seven solid years.” He also disclosed that the dearth of quality indigenous music informed his decision to adopt the genre of Afrofolk. “My style of music was greatly influenced and inspired by Beautiful Nubia who I always listened to while growing up,” said Oluko, an indigene of Oro in Irepodun LGA, Kwara State and graduate of Yoruba Education from Adeyemi College of Education affiliated to Obafemi Awolowo University Ife, Ondo State. While the musical video of ‘Enu Agba’ is available on YouTube, fans can listen to his other tracks on his website, www.olukoafroculture.com.
