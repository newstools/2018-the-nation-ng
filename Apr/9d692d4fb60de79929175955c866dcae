The army in Maiduguri has granted pardon to three UNICEF staff over “unfounded” allegations of human rights abuse and rape.” The Theatre Commander Maj. Gen. Rogers Nicholas had last Thursday declared Priscillia Hoveyda, Maher Farea and Milen Kidane, child protection specialists with UNICEF, persona non grata for their involvement in the allegations. A senior UNICEF official yesterday told our correspondent on condition of anonymity that the organisation will not engage in a media war with the military but rather resolve the issue using other channels. Investigation revealed a high- levelled meeting between the officials of UNICEF in Maiduguri and the military where a truce was reached. Following the truce, it was learnt the army decided to back down and directed the affected staff should feel free to conduct their businesses in the Northeast. A statement by Lieutenant Commander Delightsome Yohana said the declaration of persona non grata on the UNICEF staff had been withdrawn. It reads: “The  Theatre Commander Operation LAFIYA DOLE Major General Rogers Nicholas after discussions and due consultations with the leadership and executives of UNICEF, has  withdrawn  the declaration of persona non grata declared on the three UNICEF staff involved in the issue at stake, stating that they are at liberty to go about their duties”. UNICEF communication Specialists Ms Eva Hinds did not respond to calls and text messages.
