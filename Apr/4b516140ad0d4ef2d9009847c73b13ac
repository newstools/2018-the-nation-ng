Organisers of the 2018 edition of the Big Brother Naija tagged ‘Double Wahala’ have apologised for publishing incorrect voting results. On Sunday, host of the live eviction party, Ebuka, showed how the pattern viewers voted as is the usual practice. According to the figures displayed during the live show, Nina had 44% of the votes, followed by Cee-C with 24.38%, Teddy A with 16.81%, and finally Bam Bam with 13.37% with the total being 98.56%. However, following complaints that the numbers didn’t add up, the organisers went on Twitter to apologise, admitting that Nina actually received 45.44% of the votes instead of 44% which was displayed. “Dear viewers, An incorrect percentage was published for Nina during tonight’s Eviction show,” they tweeted. “While we deeply regret this error, we wish to state that the audited and verified percentage for Nina is 45.44% as opposed to 44%. We thank you for your usual support & understanding.” Teddy A was evicted during the live show on Sunday, a day after Bambam’s shocking Saturday eviction. With this development, nine housemates remain in contention for the grand prize of N445m and a SUV.
