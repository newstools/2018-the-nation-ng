Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi state has sworn-in Mr Ikechukwu Nwobo as the new Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources to replace the sacked Chief Moses Nome. The new Commissioner was a former Leader of the State House of Assembly. Umahi during the occasion said that the former commissioner was sacked not because he didn’t possess agricultural expertise but because he was not passionate about the job. He said the new commissioner was elevated to the position after doing a great job as a Special Adviser to the governor. “Agriculture is what Ebonyi is known for and I enjoin the new Commissioner to be passionate about it to ensure success in office. “Nwobo endeared himself to me by the way he took care of power installations such as the ornamnetal lights during his stint at the renewable energy sector. “He also moved from his area and resuscitate the Ebonyi hotels which is a wake-up call to other officials to be creative”. “You should be busy and creative to attract government support as Nwobo should work seriously with the leaders of the International Fund for Agrcitulture Develeopmnt (IFAD) and FADAMA in the state,” he said. The governor directed the new com misnomer to sort issues the government had over its land and get people to be supported in cultivating them. I want you to work with ifad and Fadama. In his reaction, Mr Nwobo thanked the governor for finding him worthy to serve and promised to do his best to ensure that the agricultural revolution started by the governor continues. ENDS
