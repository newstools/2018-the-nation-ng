Following the arrest of the embattled senator representing Kogi West senatorial district, Dino Melaye on Tuesday, another attempt by the Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS) to take him to Lokoja, Kogi State, was foiled by passersby in Abuja. Melaye, who was initially arrested and detained at the SARS facility along the Area 1 Expressway, Abuja, was reportedly told by the policemen that he was being taken to court. It was gathered that the senator agreed to go to court with the armed policemen, but a scuffle reportedly ensued between the lawmaker and the policemen. The scuffle followed Melaye’s attempt to resist being driven to Kogi State by the policemen, consequent upon which the senator reportedly raised the alarm which attracted some passersby. An eyewitness said people’s attention was drawn to the scuffle in the moving vehicle and people quickly milled around the vehicle. The policemen later abandoned the lawmaker and drove off. The senator was said to have gone to Zankli Hospital in Lokoja. He was said to be receiving medical treatment at the time of filing this report.
