Protesters from Senator Ovie Omo-Agege’s constituency stormed the National Assembly on Wednesday to demand for his reinstatement. The protesters decried the continued suspension of the Delta Central Senator by the Senate. The Senate suspended Omo-Agege on April 12 for 90 legislative days over remarks on elections’ sequence. The protesters, who came under the aegis of “Delta Central Collective,” demanded the immediate recall of Omo-Agege. They threatened that the senator’s continued suspension was an invitation to anarchy. A written speech by the group and signed by its Chairman, Chief Clever Akpovona Egbeji, described Omo – Agege’s suspension as illegal. The letter which they claimed was sent to the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, noted that “based on previous rulings of the courts, neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives has the power to suspend any of its members.” “The Senate has no constitutional powers to suspend any of its members as established by judgements in the case of Senator Ali Ndume vs the Senate in 2017, Bauchi State House of Assembly vs Hon Danna, and House of Representatives vs Hon (now Senator)  Dino Melaye and others in 2009/2010,” the protesters said.
