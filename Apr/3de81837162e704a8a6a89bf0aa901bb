The Police Command in Lagos State has arrested a 48-year-old man suspected to be the operator of a fake West Africa Examination Council ( WAEC ) examination centre in Igbogbo, Ikorodu. The Commissioner of Police in the state, CP Edgal Imohimi, said the suspects were arrested on April 25 following a complaint by a senior member of staff of WAEC office, Ogba. “The complaint was that there exist a fake WAEC centre at El-Supreme Private School located at No. 3, Oseni Adekogbe Street, Igbogbo Ikorodu. “Operatives of the Command attached to Area ‘G’ Ogba, were mobilised to the above address where one Pastor Adeniyi Joshua of El-Supreme Church was arrested. “WAEC question papers and answer sheets suspected to be forged were recovered from the suspect.” Imohimi said. Similarly, four suspects who specialise in solving examination questions and circulating the answers through various websites and Whatsapp numbers were also paraded by the police. Imohimi said the Rapid Response Squad ( RRS ) decoy team traced and arrested the suspects from Edo, Osun and Ondo State. “Some other suspects had been traced to Ghana. We are working with Interpol to make sure they are arrested as soon as possible. “We are also working with the examination bodies involved to make sure we get to the bottom of this. “This is something of national interest and a great embarrassment. We will ensure that this does not repeat itself. “Parents, guardians and tutors must also guide their wards not to engage in exam malpractices,’’ Imohimi said. NAN
