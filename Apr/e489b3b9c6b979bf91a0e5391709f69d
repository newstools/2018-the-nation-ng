Victor Moses’ hope of a top-four finish in the Premier League suffered a fatal blow as Javier Hernandez gave West Ham a late equalizer at Stamford Bridge. The Nigerian international saw 78 minutes of action on Sunday and was rated average as Chelsea were held to a 1-1 draw by the visiting team. Cesar Azpilicueta scored for Chelsea in the 36th minute but the blues were denied three points after Javier Hernandez netted an equalizer three minutes after he came off the bench. The Mexican whipped home a fine strike just four minutes after stepping off the bench to secure a precious point in the Hammers’ fight for survival. The result means Victor Moses and his teammates are now a whopping 10 points behind Tottenham in fourth, while West Ham move six points clear of the relegation zone. Moses was awarded five out of ten marks, same as Thibaut Courtois, Marcos Alonso and Cesc Fabregas, and only the much-maligned Spaniard Alvaro Morata scored less than the trio. Moses’s defensive rating against West Ham could not be doubtful as the Nigerian finished the game with a team-high four tackles and he committed no fouls.
