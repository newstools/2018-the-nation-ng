President of the Para-Power lifting Nigeria, Queen Idris Uboh has promised her athletes N50, 000 for each gold medal they win at the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. Uboh told NationSport yesterday that the incentive is to boost the morale of the six athletes and two coaches that will represent Nigeria in powerlifting in Gold Coast. She stated that the athletes have been good ambassadors of the country hence the need for the monetary incentive. She expressed hope that all the athletes would win gold in their weight categories at the Games. “The powerlifters know their onions and I am sure they will put in their best in bringing gold medal to Nigeria. The coaches would benefit from the largesse since they are also part of the team.” “I will be with them on Monday and we will have a meeting on what we need to do to dominate the powerlifting event. We had a good preparation and I hope it will be enough to help us win medals,” Uboh added. She also said that team would be in France next month for a meet that would determine whether they (powerlifters) would make it to the 2020 Olympic Games in Japan. She stated that the federation need 12, 000 euros to register for the event and called on well-meaning Nigerians and corporate organizations for support. “We have to be in France in May for a world event and I intend to go with 17 athletes to brighten our chance of having many powerlifters at the 2020 Olympics. We cannot do this alone because we need 12, 000 euros as entry fee. So we call on Nigeria for support,” Uboh added.
