Super Eagles midfielder, Alex Iwobi made light of Özil’s absence as he helped Arsenal to a 3-2 victory over Southampton at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday. The Nigerian successfully created three chances in the match and two of it led to goals.  Iwobi was involved in the build up to Arsenal’s first goal scored by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and also provided the assist for Danny Welbeck to score the second and third goals. The Hale End Academy product would have doubled the Gunners advantage six minutes into the second half but saw his shot saved by goalkeeper McCarthy. Iwobi will become only the second Nigerian player in history to reach 100 games for Arsenal, after Nwankwo Kanu, if he gets playing time in nine more matches and that could happen before the end of this season.
