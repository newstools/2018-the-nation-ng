The police on Wednesday arraigned a driver, Martins Okike, in a Karmo Grade 1 Area Court, Abuja, for allegedly absconding with his employerâ€™s N50,000. Okike, a resident of No. 14 Agbo Avenue, Enugu, was arraigned on a two-count charge of criminal breach of trust and mischief. The prosecutor, Mr Dalhatu Zannah, told the court that one Chigozie Anthony of Miracle Transport, Old Cross Country Park, Abuja, reported the incident at Utako Police Station on April 24. Zannah said that sometime in February 2018, the complainant gave the defendant a Sienna bus for commercial purpose with an agreement to remit money. He said that the defendant intentionally converted N50, 000 to his own personal use and disappeared to an unknown destination. Zannah also said that the defendant also damaged the bus door valued at N25, 000, without the consent of the owner, an offence that contravened Sections 312 and 317 of the Penal Code. Okike, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The judge, Mr Abubakar Sadiq, granted Okike bail in the sum of N30, 000 with a surety in like sum and adjourned the matter until May 22 for hearing.
