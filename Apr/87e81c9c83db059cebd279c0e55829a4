Police on Thursday returned the recovered mace to the Senate. The mace was brought to the Senate at 12:06 p.m. to the delight of workers in the National Assembly. The Senate’s symbol of authority was snatched from the upper legislative chamber by hoodlums on Wednesday. The Deputy Force Public Relations Officer, Adeniran Aremu, had said in a statement on Thursday morning that the mace was recovered under the flyover near the Abuja city gate where it was abandoned. The Deputy Inspector of Police (Operations), Joshak Habila, brought back the mace and handed it over to the Clerk of the National Assembly, Sanni Omolori. Omolori later took the mace to the Senate chamber and handed it over to the Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu. Ekweremadu, who presided over the Executive Session of the Senate, said the stolen mace had been recovered and brought back to the upper legislative chamber.
