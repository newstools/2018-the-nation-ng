Ibadan Authentic Mogajis yesterday  warned individuals and groups against inciting the authorities against them. Rising from a meeting at the palace of Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, they said this would enable peace to reign. Citing a newspaper report in which Kano-based Prince Muji Armstrong-Bello urged them to obey the court judgment voiding their elevation as kings; the Mogajis insisted they have violated no law. A statement signed by Alhaji Abass Oloko (Mogaji Oloko), Chief Abduljelyl Karheem (Mogaji Adanla), Alhaji Moshud Gbolagade (Mogaji Akere) and Alhaji Ademola Oladosu (Mogaji Olasomi) queried the Kano-based prince on matters affecting the age-long traditional institution in Ibadan. Armstrong-Bello viewed the threat by the Mogajis to the sacked Obas to stop wearing beaded crowns “as provocative and inciting, warning that unless law agencies intervened, there could be a breakdown of order.” But the Mogajis decried such position.
