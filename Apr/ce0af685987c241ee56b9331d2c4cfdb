The Co-ordinator, Bring Back our Girls (BBOG) Lagos State Chapter, Mrs Aisha Oyebode, wants Nigerians to stand up in prayers for those children still in the captivity of terrorists. She made the call on Friday night at the Interfaith Vigil of the fourth Anniversary of the abduction of Chibok school girls, at Falomo Roundabout, Lagos. She urged Nigerians not to sit back to watch Nigerian children dehumanised. She said that the remaining girls in captivity are suffering untold anguish that could be better imagined than experienced. She said the voices of the captive Chibok girls “may not be heard in public, but they sound clearly in the hearts of their parents, community and well-meaning Nigerians.’’ The Imam of Falomo Police Mosque, Alhaji  Tajudeen Adebayo, during the interfaith prayers, thanked Allah for those that were released and prayed that the remaining girls would also be rescued. Pastor Ituah Ighodalo, Senior Pastor, Trinity House Church, prayed that God might bring back the remaining girls, and  urged Nigerians not to relent in their prayers for the nation. “It is only when we come together to speak and act as one, that our voices will be heard and we can achieve the desired change,” he said.
