THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has disputed President Muhammadu Buhari’s alleged statement describing youths as lazy. According to the main opposition party, Nigerian youths, by their demonstrated industry, could not in any way be described by anybody as lazy. A statement yesterday by the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, said Nigerians find it extremely shocking that Buhari could make such a “false, derogatory and unpatriotic” comment against our citizens at a time the nation was looking up to him to properly present the country’s potentials to the global business community. The statement said: “It is alarming that at every international event, the President makes it a favorite past time to de-market, paint and denigrate our dear nation and her citizens in very negative light, an indication that he has stopped believing in Nigeria. “Mr. President’s latest salvo is totally unacceptable and must be condemned by all right-thinking people to avoid further verbal assault against our country, particularly at international fora.”
