As part of its plans to institutionalise wrestling, the Bayelsa state government has concluded plans to build an ultra-modern wrestling gym in the state capital, Yenagoa. This was disclosed by the state governor Henry Seriake Dickson during a reception in Yenagoa in honour of Team Nigeria wrestlers to the recently-concluded 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia, on Tuesday. “I have told Daniel Igali (President of the Nigeria Wrestling Federation) that before the end of this year, we would have finished the construction of a modern wrestling gym in Yenagoa,” Governor Dickson promised. “We have already awarded the contract. Let me direct the finance team by next week, to release 50% of the cost to the contractor. I believe before the end of this year, a number of you will be invited so that we can commission it, and put that to use.” According to Dickson, embarking on such project is a statement of the fact that the state is a hub for wrestling in Africa. “All that is to underscore the fact that this State (Bayelsa) is the headquarters of wrestling in our continent,” he stated. When completed, the wrestling gym will be used for the preparation of athletes for major competitions, as well as hosting of championships.
