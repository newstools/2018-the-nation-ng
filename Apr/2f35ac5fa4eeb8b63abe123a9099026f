A former Minister of National Planning, Prof.  Abubakar Suleiman, said on Thursday he would consult his counsel for necessary action over the dismissal of his no-case submission by Justice Rilwan M. Aikawa of the Federal High Court sitting in Lagos. Suleiman is standing trial alongside Muhammed Belgore (SAN), who was a former governorship candidate during the 2011 governorship election in Kwara State. They were accused of  allegedly receiving the sum of N450million on March 27, 2015 out of the $115,010,000 paid by a former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Diezani Alison-Madueke, to compromise the 2015 general election. In a terse text message last night, the ex-minister said: “There is more to it, I will consult with my counsel and take necessary action. “It is shocking and unbelievable. I think there is more to that judgment.”
