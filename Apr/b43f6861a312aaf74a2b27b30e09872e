The President of Anwar-ul Islam Movement of Nigeria, Alhaji Mubashiru Ojelade, has attributed terrorists’ attacks to bad leadership and ill preachers of religion. He said the peace enjoyed in the past had been lost to government’s failure to address sensitive issues affecting the country. Ojelade, who spoke at the 70th anniversary of  Anwar-ul Islam Model College, Agege, Lagos, said: “If you look at the situation in this country, up to the 70s and 80s, religious strife was rare. But the situation has changed because of bad leadership and ill preachers of religion.” Justice Ishola Olorunibe (retd), a member of the pioneering set, praised Anwar-ul Islam Movement’s effort in educating Muslims. He said the school had produced successful people in all spheres of life. The speaker, Dr.  Tajudeen Abanikannda, of the Lagos State University, Ojo, who spoke on the theme: “Child education: a lasting legacy”, advised the government to prioritise education as a panacea for solving problems.
