A mob on Sunday afternoon attacked the Divisional Crime Officer (DCO) of Sagamu Road Police Station, Opawoye Adetunji, a Superintendent (SP), for allegedly shooting a civilian. The incident occurred at Alapere in Ketu around 3pm. It was gathered that Adetunji attempted to shoot a commercial driver, who violated traffic laws. Although the real facts of the case were sketchy as of yesterday, The Nation gathered that the bullets hit a civilian bystander on the head. The sight of the injured civilian was said to have angered other road users, who descended on the policeman. According to a source, the mob beat the policeman to coma and was about lynching him when policemen from Alapere and Rapid Response Squad (RRS) intervened. Both the policeman and his victim were said to have been rushed to an undisclosed hospital. Police spokesman Chike Oti said Commissioner Imohimi Edgal directed that a comprehensive query be issued to the cop. He said Edgal frowned at the unwarranted use of firearm by the senior police officer, describing it as firearm abuse. Oti said: “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, Imohimi Edgal, deeply regrets the unwarranted use of firearm by a Superintendent attached to Sagamu Road Police Station as the Divisional Crime Officer (DCO), SP Opawoye Adetunji. “He has directed that the officer be issued a comprehensive query for shooting a civilian on April 15, for a yet to be determined reason. “The officer is currently recuperating in an undisclosed hospital alongside his victim. He has not been able to give his statement because he is still unconscious as a result of the beating he received and injuries sustained when the mob attacked him at the scene of incident. “The CP further directs that as soon he regains consciousness, he should be served with the query. The command has never and would never tolerate the use of firearm outside the provisions of Force Order 237.”
