A 400-level Economics student of the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, Abia State, Obinna Chiaha, was, at the weekend, killed by a commercial motorist. Eyewitness said the driver tried to overtake a trailer when he hit Chiaha. The incident, which occurred close to the university gate on the Umuahia/Ikot Ekpene road, caused pandemonium as students protested Chiaha’s death. They caught the driver and handed him over to the university’s security men. Unconfirmed reports said the students became violent when Chiaha was confirmed dead at the Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Umuahia. Chiaha’s body was taken to a morgue. A school source said: “Many students, on hearing the sad news, took to the streets to protest his death. “The Vice Chancellor, Prof. Francis Otunta, who addressed the students on the phone, urged them to remain calm as the university will ensure that the deceased student gets justice.”
