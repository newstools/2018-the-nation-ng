Violence and alleged malpractice trailed Saturday’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Special Ward Congress to elect delegates for the governorship primary in Ekiti State. A former chairman of Ikere Local Government Area, Mr. Banji Aluko, was beaten up by suspected thugs loyal to the state Deputy Governor, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, in Ikere-Ekiti. Olusola is enjoying the backing of his boss, Governor Ayo Fayose, who has adopted him as his preferred candidate for the July 14 governorship poll. Aluko was accused of working against “Ikere Agenda” by the thugs who flogged him with canes and sticks loaded inside a mini bus otherwise known as “akoto” and parked opposite the election venue at Odo Oja area of the town. The hoodlums accused Aluko of working for another governorship aspirant and former Minister of State for Works, Prince Dayo Adeyeye. Aluko, who was also accused of fraternizing with Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN), allegedly tore result sheet from Ogbonjana Ward believed to have been manipulated and this angered his attackers. Apart from the beating Aluko, he was also drenched with alcohol and forced out of the election venue.
