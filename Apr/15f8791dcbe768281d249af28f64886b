The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) has assured that card issuance is an ongoing process that cannot be stopped. Reacting news report alleging titled: 28.5m Nigerians agonise over suspension of Nat’l ID card issuance,   its  Head, Corporate Communications Unit, Loveday Ogbonna, in a statement yesterday said the report, especially the headline, is false and misleading as the Commission has not suspended the issuance of cards to successful enrolees at any time. Accordingly, he added, all individuals who, upon completion of their enrolment, have received an text message are invited to proceed to the NIMC Office where they enrolled to pick up their cards from today. Persons who have not received an SMS can equally check the status of their cards on the NIMC website via www.nimc.gov.ng. “Citizens and legal residents who have also relocated from where they enrolled are advised to visit any NIMC office closest to them to request a card transfer form, which they would fill, and submit to the state coordinator for processing. “However, Nigerians and legal residents are reminded that the National Identification Number (NIN) is the unique identifier and most important token issued by the Commission and not the physical e-ID Card,” he said. The NIN, which is fast gaining acceptance by Nigerians, is a set of 11 non-intelligent numbers randomly assigned to an individual at the completion of enrolment into the National Identity Database (NIDB).
