The Nigerian Army on Wednesday promised to make public the findings of the panel set up to investigate the allegations levelled against it by former Minister of Defence, Gen. T.Y. Danjuma (retd). The Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, made the promise when the panel led by its President, Maj.-Gen. John Nimyel, submitted its report. Buratai set up the panel on April 9. He also received the report of the 17-member Committee on Arms Verification which he set up on March 19. Danjuma on March 24 alleged that some troops on internal operation in Taraba colluded with killers and suspected herdsmen and did not protect residents against attacks. “You must rise to protect yourselves from these people; if you depend on the armed forces to protect you, you will all die “I ask all of you to be on the alert and defend your country and defend your state,” he said. Danjuma’s call had ignited mixed reactions across the country, forcing the army to constitute the panel to get to the root of the allegations. But receiving the report, Buratai said: “We will take every aspect of this report very seriously. We will make this report available to appropriate superior authorities. “We will also make this report available to the media so that they will see clearly what transpired and to see whether the allegations against the military, particularly the Nigerian army, is grounded or whether it is true or not.’’ Buratai, who said making the report available to the public would clarify the allegations, thanked the panel members for their painstaking efforts and sacrifice.
