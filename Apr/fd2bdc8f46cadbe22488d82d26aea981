A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has rejected an application filed by the Senator representing Delta Central,  Ovie Omo-Agege, requesting the court to stop his suspension by the Senate. Justice Nnamdi Dimgba, in an ex-parte ruling on April 11, a copy of which The Nation sighted on Thursday, declined the Senator’s prayer to order parties to maintain status quo by suspending all actions concerning the issues raised in the suit. On getting wind of his impending suspension, Omo-Agege had on April 3, filed the ex-parte application seeking among others, an order that “all further proceedings against him in respect of the allegations referred to the 1st defendant’s (Senate’s) Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petition” be halted pending the hearing and determination of his main suit. He asked the court to order parties to the main suit earlier filed on March 26 “not to consider, act on or give effect to any recommendation, resolution or decision of the Senate’s Committee on Ethics, Privileges and Public Petition.” Listed as defendants are the Senate, its President, Bukola Saraki, and the Attorney-General of the Federation,  Abubakar Malami (SAN). Omo-Agege’s lawyer, E.R. Emukpoeuo, while moving the ex -parte application, prayed the court to grant the order directing parties to maintain the status quo. But, in his ruling, Justice Dimgba said he could not grant such orders without hearing from the defendants “in the interest of maintaining the balance of power between the judicial and the legislative organs of government.”
