A non-governmental organisation (NGO) under the Catholic Church, Pro-life League, has called for the abolition of abortion, saying those who commit it are guilty of killing innocent beings. At a rally at the National Stadium Surulere, Lagos, by  St. Denis Catholic Church, Bariga, titled: ‘Match for life’, the church drew attention of the public to the dangers of abortion and to enlighten the youth on the way to live a life of chastity. The founder, Mechelin Iketalu said the organisation wants the world to know that there were still people who stand against abortion. She said: ”We want to let the world know that there is a group of people who are fighting to stop the issue of abortion because nobody has any right to take anybody’s life. We are an NGO under the Catholic Church and we accommodate everyone”. Iketalu, who also spoke on restoring respect for human life, said  people should understand that the child in the womb is a being with a separate heart, soul, body and all components of a person and there is a moral burden to guide the baby with our lives. She added: “There is no such thing as an unwanted pregnancy because every child comes from God.” At the event were two members of the NGO, were Miss Chukuwma Matilda and Miss Esther Nwokocha, who after being counselled by a priest, changed their minds on abortion, and they gave birth to a baby boy and a baby girl.
