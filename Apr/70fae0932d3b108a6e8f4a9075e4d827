Some members of National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) on Friday distributed 40 safety helmets to commercial motorcyclists in Auchi, Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo. The President of NYSC Community Development Service in the state, Mr Olujokun Azeez, who presented the helmets, said the distribution of the “head protector” was to enhance the safety of bike riders and passengers. He said “the provision of helmets to motorcyclists is part of our NYSC community development service. “The idea is to make positive development in the community and reduce the rate of injuries during bike accidents. “The head is the most vulnerable part of human body that needs to be protected during accident, hence the importance of the helmet.” He urged motorcyclists to always put on helmet to help save lives. The Auchi Unit Commander of FRSC, Mr Moses Bature, said the helmet was to prevent injury in the event of an accident, especially injuries in the head. Bature frowned at the non-compliance to the usage of safety helmet in the area, adding that the command would clampdown on motorcyclists who do not use it. He said “most motorcyclists don’t use safety helmets. In spite of the penalties attached to the offence, people still don’t want to comply. “I believe with time we will go beyond the fines and start charging offenders to court.” The Chairman of Bike Riders Association, Auchi branch, Mr Mohammed Jimoh, lauded the gesture of the corps members and promised to ensure strict use of the helmet and maintain law and order in the community. He said “the gesture will go a long way in curbing accidents. It will greatly assist in protecting and saving lives of our members and passengers.” NAN
