India’s highest ranked player in the world,  Sathiyan Gnanasekaran has admitted that Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri is the most feared player for the Asian team when the 2018 Commonwealth Games begins in Gold Coast Australia come April. Gnanasekaran, who is ranked 50th in the February 2018 rating released by ITTF told NationSport from his base in Pune, India that they have identified Quadri and they are working hard to neutralize him. “There are a lot of good players coming to the Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast. We have players like Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri, England’s duo of Paul Drinkhall and Liam Pitchford as well as Singapore’s Gao Ning and they will certainly be tough competitors. But I must pick out Aruna Quadri because he is one of the biggest threats for the Indian team as he is a great player and has been playing very well in the last few years. But I think we are well prepared and working out strategies to face the strong Nigerian in Gold Coast,” says Gnanasekaran. The 2017 Spanish Open champion who will be making his debut at the Commonwealth Games believes the Indian team has the quality to rule the table tennis event in Australia. “This will be my first Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast and I am really happy to be part of the Indian contingent as it has always been my dream to take part in a big multi-sporting event. I have to give my best in Australia and hoping to win as many medals as possible. I have set a high target of winning three gold medals.” “India has a very good chance of winning gold medal in the team event as we have a strong and balanced team this year. I am really excited for the Games and hope to make it the best tournament in my life. I hope I can bring out the best of me during the Games. I am looking forward eagerly to win gold medal and waiting to hear the Indian national anthem to be played at the Games,” the trained engineer told NationSport.
