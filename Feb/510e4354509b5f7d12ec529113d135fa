“I am married with two kids, Four years and Eight months. My hubby is a great cheat, and whenever I notice a new side chick I try to get her number and plead with her to stop dating him, I kept doing this. Although some of the girls will insult me and report me to my husband who will always take it up. Whenever this happens, he stops taking care of me and my child because as at then, I didn’t have the child yet. Thinking of the way he treats me and my kid, I thought about getting a job. He has always frowned at this claiming that women who work are prostitute. I did get a job and my boss insisted I get a degree. I took to his advice, got an admission and resumed school as a part time student. I decided to always take a salary advance to pay my school fee. It was a little of new life for me and an improved one. During the week, my son stays with my mum while I pick him on Friday. Before I knew it, I was pregnant with my second child. I was three months gone when I noticed my hubby is seeing a lady I begged her as usual but it did not work. She told my hubby and he started maltreating me even with my condition so I went to d girl’s brother to report her and he was able to stop them from seeing each other. Now, my husband said I will pay for what I did cos I reported the lady. He said I owe him nothing because he gives me money every day. This is an amount that is worth nothing. Now, he is asking me to choose between him and my work. He said I should stop working or our marriage should end. I would have taken to his decision but I am very sure that if a new chick shows up, he would forget about me totally. Ending the marriage is not the issue, the issue is how will I take care of the kids alongside paying my school fees. I still have two years to go, how do I cope? I just hope I won’t hurt myself cos this is too much for me to bear”
