 Arsenal are concerned that midfielder Aaron Ramsey could follow the likes of Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez by running his contract into its final year. Ramsey’s current deal expires in the summer of 2019 and Arsenal are eager to retain the services of the Welshman, who has made more appearances, 318, for the club than any other current member of the first-team squad. As reported by The Times, Ramsey wants a significant increase on his current wages of £110,000 a week, especially with recent signings Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang earning around £170,000 a week each. Arsenal want to avoid a repeat of the situation that saw Ozil and Sanchez, as well as Jack Wilshere, enter the last year of their contracts with their futures still uncertain. Ozil eventually signed a new deal earlier this month that saw him up his wages to around £300,000 a week, while Sanchez joined Manchester United and Wilshere has yet to commit to a new contract. Ramsey has scored six goals and provided eight assists in 18 Premier League appearances for Arsenal this season but has missed several games through injury. The 27-year-old’s representative recently left his agency and set up a new company, which has delayed negotiations over Ramsey’s new deal, but isn’t expected to be a significant problem going forwards. Ramsey, having recovered from illness, will hope to start when Arsenal take on Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final at Wembley on Sunday. Arsenal’s next Premier League game is also against City, with the sides meeting at Emirates Stadium next week.
