 It was fruitful Wednesday as two Nigerian club sides flying the nation’s flag in the CAF Champions league booked their places to the next round after riding on the back of their hard fighting opponents. MFM playing in front of their vociferous fans at the Agege Township Stadium otherwise called the Temple, made a clean job their assignment grabbing an 85th minute goal against visiting Real Bamako to advance. The Lagos based side had triggered off their success story, when they held their opponents to a 1-1 draw away.  It was all thanks to Akuneto Chijioke who made mince meat of a perfect cross from Abayomi Lawal. League leaders Plateau United on the other hand earned a lone goal victory away against Editing Sport of Cameroon. Plateau United had in the first leg posted an impressive 3-0 victory over the Cameroonian side heading into the return leg with a 3-0 advantage. All they needed to do in the second leg was to play their game and finish what they have started and that was exactly what they did. Akwa United who are battling against Hawks of Gambia have what some have dubbed herculean task as they attempt to move forward. The Uyo based side had unfortunately lost 2-1 to the visitors in the first leg, thus going into the second leg walking a tight rope. Some say turning the table in Gambia will not be a tea party while others however say luck may play a role to earn the Uyo side something to cheer about. More to follow
