All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in River State Hon. Jonathan Vatsa has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to sack the cabals in his cabinet to complete his fight against corruption. He said the president should use his appointment as the continental anti-corruption crusader to clean the system, adding that charity begins at home. Vatsa said Nigerians will never believe in the president’s fight against corruption, if corruption people are still holding positions in his cabinet. He said: “I am saying this to President Buhari, until you do away with the cabals, Nigerians will never take your anti-corruption war seriously.” Vatsa, a former Commissioner for Information, said in Minna, the state capital, that President Buhari had appointed some of his kinsmen who are now cabals in his cabinet. He said: “President Buhari must have the political will to eject his kinsmen and the cabals who have hijacked the government and inject new people, especially technocrats with new ideas who are ready to reshape this country. “His silence has kept many Nigerians in doubt whether he meant all the promises made during campaigns and after his resumption of office. We worked for the APC and what we envisaged is not what we are witnessing. President Buhari should keep to his words especially his inaugural speech when he said ‘I belong to everybody and I belong to nobody. Vatsa added: “Until he can do away with them, Nigerians can never believe that he is fighting corruption. He should prove to us that he is ready to save Nigeria. “Now that the Appeal Court has ruled that Magu be removed, President Buhari should quickly replace him because he is not the only credible Nigerian. There are other Nigerians that can even do better.”
