Lagos  State Accountant General/ Permanent Secretary, State Treasury Office, Mrs Abimbola Umar, has directed ministries departments and agencies (MDA) start implementing the ‘’no cash payment’’ policy. She spoke at a forum to sensitise directors of finance and accounts (DFA) across the state on the new payment regime at the seat of power in Alausa, Ikeja. She said the abolition would plug  loopholes in revenue generation and eliminate incidences of loss of government revenue. “The governor’s directive will ensure all revenue collections go through the government designated banks and multi-payment channels such as web-pay, pay-point, USSD and the conventional online payments”. Umar said no MDA was exempted under the scheme. “All cash payments for revenue collection should be stopped henceforth,” she said. According to her, the move will strengthen ease of doing business in the state especially in the area of transaction with the government, and also prevent fraudulent transactions. She urged accountants to begin to sensitise  tax payers on the ‘‘No Cash Payment’’ policy and the various payment channels available.
