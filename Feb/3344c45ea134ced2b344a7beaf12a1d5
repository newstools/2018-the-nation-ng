A coalition of over 20 women societies and groups, under the aegis of the National Association of Isiala Ngwa Progressive Women, has endorsed Lady Blessing Nwokonneya for the Isiala Ngwa Federal Constituency seat in next year’s election. It made the call in a communiqué by its National President Chief Anastesia Ukomadu, and National Secretary Lady Adaku Erondu, issued at the end of its enlarged town hall meeting held in Omoba, the capital of Isiala Ngwa South council of Abia State. The coalition said the call on Lady Nwokonneya to run for the office was in consideration of her track record, commitment to the people’s welfare, wealth of experience and confidence in her capacity to offer a first class representation in the House of Representatives. Lady Nwokonneya is a financial management specialist and professional banker with many years of experience. She has also won several awards of excellence. The communiqué said: “Given her background, exposure, quality experience, rich network and commitment to the good of our people, Lady Nwokonneya will no doubt offer the people of Isiala Ngwa North and South Federal Constituency a quality and purposeful representation that has never been seen before.” The groups urged Lady Nwokonneya, a woman leader of Isiala Ngwa residents in Abuja and Lady of Knights of Mulumba, to stand up and be counted and urged stakeholders to support the candidature of Lady Nwokonneya to lift the constituency’s socio-economic life.
