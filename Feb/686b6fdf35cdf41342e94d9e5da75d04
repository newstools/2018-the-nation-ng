The President of the Academic Staff Union of Universities ( ASUU ) Dr Biodun Ogunyemi has assured that the current crisis rocking Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) chapter of the union would soon be resolved. According to him, the crisis is just a little problem over the decision of the union at the National level to ‘punish’ officials of the union for their various roles during the Vice Chancellorship crisis that rocked the University in 2016. “Basically what caused this issue was the disciplinary measure meted out to officials of the University.  We would get over the storm soon but there is nothing like ASUU OAU pulling out. Only some persons are frowning at the disciplinary measures,” Ogunyemi ascertained. Following the disagrement, some lecturers who are reportedly said to belong to the  Niyi Sunmonu led faction of the union in the University had said they would pull out of ASUU and stop paying their dues.
