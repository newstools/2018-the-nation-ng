A 50-year-old treasurer at Omole Phase 2 Residential Association, Lekan Somorin, on Wednesday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos over alleged theft of N9.5 million. Somorin, who resides at Omole Phase 2, Olowora, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of forgery and theft. The prosecutor, Insp. Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the accused committed the offence between March 2016 and Nov. 2017 at Omole Phase 2 Residential Association C.D.A office, Lagos. Emuerhi said that the accused stole the money and falsified the association’s account records. “When he was asked about the N9.5 million, he could not give any satisfactory explanation on how the money got missing. “All efforts made by the complainant to get the accused to refund the money proved abortive,” he said. The offences contravened Sections 287 and 337 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Section 337 provides a 15-year jail term for offenders, if found guilty. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. In her ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, granted the accused bail of N1 million with two sureties in like sum. Osunsanmi said that the sureties should be gainfully employed and show evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. She adjourned the case until May 31 for mention. NAN
