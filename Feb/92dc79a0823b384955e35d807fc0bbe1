 Young boxer Abu-Peter Benjamin from BBC Boxing Club thrilled boxing fans in the just concluded 90th edition of the Monthly Saturday Boxing Show at the Mobolaji Johnson Sports Centre, Yaba, Lagos. Benjamin defeated Bamigbiye on points in a very tensed three-round 69kg contest and aspiring welterweight thanked the Chairman of Lagos Boxing Hall Of Fame, Olawale Edun for his commitment to the growth of boxing and thanked the fans for coming to watch boxers fight. “We are grateful to Mr Olawale Edun for given us (boxers) the opportunity to fight. “Also, we would like thank our fans for their support and prayers towards boxing.” Other bouts decided saw the deft Sofiat Lateef from Smart Boxing Club out-punch Fatimah Ibrahim from Hard-Punch Boxing Club by a split decision in their female 51kg bout while the 56kg division saw punches from Rising Star Boxing Club’s Giwa Akinola too much for a clearly flustered Adijat Gbadamosi that her corner from Smart Boxing Club threw in the towel early in the second round. Owonikoko’s Boxing Club’s Abiodun Azeez also defeated Adewale Haastrup of Kamlat Boxing Club in the 64kg weight class by a 5-0 unanimous decision while the 52kg bout saw Adeniji Adewale of Ola-Akins Boxing Club walk over Rilwan Mustapha of Oluomo Boxing Club as the latter failed his medicals earlier in the day. The Monthly Saturday Boxing Show is the premier amateur boxing competition organized by the Lagos State Boxing Hall of Fame and Lagos State Amateur Boxing Association.
