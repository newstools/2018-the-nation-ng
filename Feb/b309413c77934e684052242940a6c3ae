A non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Global Care Foundation International (GCFI), has donated libraries to three rural schools in Edo State. It also stocked their libraries with books and distributed note books to pupils in the schools. Beneficiary schools were: Ubiaja Central Primary School, Ubiaja; Ologwa Primary School, Ohordua  and Okaigben Secondary School, Ewohimi  all in Esan Southeast Local Government Area of the state. President of the foundation, Mr. Christopher Obhere, said the libraries were built to assist less-privileged students whose parents may not be able to buy prescribed  text books. Obhere stated that the gesture was consistent with the vision of the foundation, which was established to render help to those in need. He said the organisation also provides support for free health care, including rendering financial assistance, among other interventions. A former Peoples Democratic Party Chairman in Edo State, Prince Solomon Aguele urged the foundation to sustain its ideals, admonishing the pupils to take full advantage of the library to enhance their studies.
