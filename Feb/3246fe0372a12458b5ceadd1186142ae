Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman Prof. Mahmood Yakubu has urged the Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs) to be firm and avoid needless controversies ahead of the 2019 general elections. Yakubu, who spoke yesterday at the first consultative meeting between the INEC management and the RECs at the commission’s National Headquarters, Abuja, advised them to be firm on the side of the law and the people as they work towards ensuring free, fair and transparent general elections. He warned the RECs on the antics of politicians, who would want to distract them through partisan comments as the polls approach. The RECs’ roles, he said, are pivotal to the success of the elections and hence the commission can never be compromised. It was the third meeting the commission held within the last 48 hours with stakeholders. The commission on Monday met with the media and the civil society organisations (CSOs). The RECs are responsible for coordinating INEC activities at the state levels. He said: “As we approach the 2019 general elections, I wish to draw your attention to the necessity that you stand firm. Be very firm on the side of the law and on the side of the people of Nigeria, who deserves nothing less than free and fair elections. “We should not be distracted, especially by partisan comments from any quarter. As the 2019 elections draw closer, there will be attempts to draw the commission into needless controversies. You must not descend into the arena.”
