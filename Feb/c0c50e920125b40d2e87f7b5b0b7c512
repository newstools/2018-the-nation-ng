The wife of the  Ondo State governor, Mrs Betty Akeredolu,  has launched the Accelerated Birth Registration (ABR) programme in collaboration with the wives of traditional rulers in the 18 local government areas  of the state. Launching the initiative on Thursday in Igbara-Oke,  Ifedore Local Government Area, Akeredolu said ABR would  develop an active communal participation at  the grassroots, alleviate the sufferings of the people and proffer effective solutions to the challenges in healthcare services and data management. She said the programme would feature the direct involvement of wives of traditional rulers (Oloris) in the state to bring healthcare to women, children and people of the state. Operating under the aegis of Olori Connection, she said “the programme would ensure that newly born babies are registered without unnecessary bureaucracy that had been created over the years. “Olori Connection programme will enable children born in the particular community to be registered through the wives of traditional rulers in those communities. “We want to involve the Oloris who will cooperate with us and with the help of Akowe Abiye in the community, we  will collect all the data and take them  to the Oloris. “The Oloris will in turn take them  to National Population Commission  to get the original birth certificates of the children and the records will be taken to the Local Government Areas to help to understand the intervention needed in any particular area from the government.’’ Akeredolu said the records put together will ensure the success of the maternal, child, adolescent, health and nutrition mandates of the government. The Olowa of Igbara- Oke, Oba Adefarakanmi Agbede, lauded the efforts of Akeredolu, promising that the community would support the programme to ensure its success. Agbede urged residents of the community to cooperate with concerned stakeholders in the implementation of the initiative. NAN
