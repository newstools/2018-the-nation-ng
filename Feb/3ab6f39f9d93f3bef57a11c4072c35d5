The Director-General of Segun Oni Campaign Organisation (SOCO) in Ekiti State, Dr. Ifeoluwa Arowosoge, has assured the people that the former governor will deliver his campaign promises to Ekiti residents, if given the opportunity to serve again. A statement yesterday by the campaign’s media aide, Mr. Steve Alabi, said Oni spoke when he hosted some All Progressives Congress (APC) leaders and members from the 16 councils. Oni, who was Ekiti State governor between 2007 and 2010, is seeking re-election on the platform of the APC. Arowosoge said Oni had been receiving calls from interest groups like teachers, civil servants, local government workers, retirees, as well as youth and women, to take another shot at the governorship, given his performance between 2007 and 2010. He recalled that Oni championed the cause for peaceful co-existence and provided social services and education during his first tenure. The former governor’s aide urged the electorate to always ensure that politicians fulfil their promises.
