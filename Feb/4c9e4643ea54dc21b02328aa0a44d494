Oracle said it has expanded the breadth and depth of its enterprise service level agreements (SLAs), delivering a superior experience to customers and help enterprises that want to shift critical workloads to the cloud.  Building on the strength of its recently announced, industry-leading 99.995 per cent availability guarantee for Oracle Autonomous Database, the firm unveiled the industry’s first end-to-end financially backed cloud warranty for Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).  With these comprehensive  SLAs, Oracle is now the only cloud infrastructure provider, offering guaranteed service levels across performance, manageability and availability: the three key characteristics defining how enterprises measure cloud infrastructure providers. “No cloud provider in the world can match what Oracle guarantees. Our competitors offer narrow commitments and countless exclusions in fine print while Oracle’s SLAs deliver an industry first: guaranteed performance, manageability and availability in the cloud,” its President of Product Development, Thomas Kurian, said in a statement. Enterprise customers require critical business applications to perform at consistent and reliable levels.  For example, they need to know back office applications are not going to bog down as they are trying to close the quarter or doing strategic analysis. In addition, enterprises expect to have the ability to immediately add resources if they need extra compute power for urgent business intelligence or to handle spikes in demand. Oracle’s new SLAs are an integral part of the company’s strategy to deliver the best cloud infrastructure for enterprise production workloads. These industry-first SLAs provide reassurance to customers, who want to shift workloads to the cloud and require not only continual availability, but also consistent performance and the ongoing ability to manage and modify the cloud infrastructure that runs their mission-critical applications and databases.
