Saudi Arabia Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Friday called on all parties to the conflict to support the peace process in the conflict-hit Afghanistan, local media reported on Friday. Salman expressed support to the peace process during a recent visit to Saudi Arabia by Mohammad Atmar, the advisor to Afghan president on national security. “Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in his meeting with National Security Advisor Mohammad Hanif Atmar called on all parties involved in the conflict to support the process to get it back on track,” Tolo television quoted a statement of Atmar’s office as saying. Taliban militants who have always rejected joining the government-backed peace process in the presence of foreign forces in Afghanistan and instead want direct talks with the U.S. government, have yet to make comments.
