A gulf appeared to have developed in the Northern Senators’ Forum following the unceremonius removal of its chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. A member of the Forum, Senator Ali Wakil, on Thursday dissociated himself from the removal of Adamu. Adamu was sacked as Chairman of Northern Senators’ Forum on Wednesday following a letter signed by the Publicity Secretary of the Forum, Dino Melaye, alleging financial misconduct. Wakil told the Senate that the meeting of the Forum was never called to discuss the sanction or removal of anybody. He said some of them watched in disbelief the announcement of Adamu’s removal. The lawmaker came short of saying the removal was done in done in bad faith. He said: “I was not here yesterday (Wednesday) but I saw it in the papers and television when you (Deputy Senate President) announced the removal of Senator Abdullahi Adamu as the leader of the Northern Senators’ Forum. “Your Excellency I come from the north and I am active member of the Northern Senators’ Forum. At no time have we met and put to question any of the leaders of the Northern Senators’ Forum. “It was brought to this place and it was announced and some of our colleagues went to the Press Centre and made statements that referred to some of us as monkeys. “We are taking this political brinkmanship beyond the level we are supposed to take it. We are supposed to be wise men.”
