Former House of Representatives member, Hon. Opeyemi Bamidele, will formally declare intention to contest for the governorship of Ekiti State on March 7. Bamidele, who is a former Commissioner for Youth and Sports and later Information and Strategy, hopes to use the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to realize him ambition. His campaign organization is already planning a big rally and declaration ceremony at the APC secretariat located in Ajilosun area of Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Director General of Opeyemi Bamidele Campaign Organisation, Hon. Ropo Ige, explained that Bamidele’s supporters in all the 16 local government areas will witness the event. He also explained that some guests from outside the state who believe in Bamidele’s vision for Ekiti transformation are also expected at the ceremony. According to him, Bamidele will unveil a manifesto to transform sectors like agriculture, security, tourism, housing, mining, human capital development, infrastructure development, good governance, among others. Ige said Bamidele has the capacity to win the governorship seat for the APC if fielded by the party as the flag bearer for the July 14 poll. He noted that Bamidele has acquired experience in governance for twelve years in Lagos State from Special Adviser to Commissioner before representing Ekiti Central Federal Constituency II in the Lower Chamber for four years. Describing Bamidele as a “man of the people who have the interest of the masses at heart,” Ige disclosed that the ex-federal lawmaker attracted 88 projects to his constituency 49 of which were completed before leaving office. Ige stressed that Bamidele remains the only aspirant that has cognate experience spanning the three arms of government as a lawyer in the temple of justice, a lawmaker in the legislature and a commissioner in the executive.
