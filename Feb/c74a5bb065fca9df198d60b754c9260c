William Billy Graham, an American evangelical Christian evangelist and an ordained Southern Baptist minister, died on Wednesday at age 99. He was one of the most influential preachers of the 20th century. He held large indoor and outdoor rallies with sermons which were broadcast on radio and television. Graham is popularly known for his preaching of the message of Christ’s freedom and forgiveness around the world. Reverend Billy Graham has preached God’s Word with so much passion and conviction for over 60 years. We recall some of her memorable quotations. “Sin is the second most powerful force in the universe, for it sent Jesus to the cross. Only one force is greater—the love of God.” “Someone asked me recently if I didn’t think God was unfair, allowing me to have Parkinson’s and other medical problems when I have tried to serve him faithfully. I replied that I did not see it that way at all. Suffering is part of the human condition, and it comes to us all. The key is how we react to it, either turning away from God in anger and bitterness or growing closer to him in trust and confidence.” “Knowing we will be with Christ forever far outweighs our burdens today! Keep your eyes on eternity!” “Take one day at a time. Today, after all, is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.” “Courage is contagious. When a brave man takes a stand, the spines of others are often stiffened.” “God proved his love on the Cross. When Christ hung, and bled, and died, it was God saying to the world, ‘I love you.’’ “A real Christian is the one who can give his pet parrot to the town gossip.” “When wealth is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost, something is lost; when character is lost, all is lost.” “Christ not only died for all: he died for each.” “When we come to the end of ourselves, we come to the beginning of God.”
