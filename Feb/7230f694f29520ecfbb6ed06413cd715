Enugu State government has urged neighbourhood watch groups to hand over suspects to the police for interrogation and prosecution. Capital Development and Poverty Reduction Commissioner Mr. Obinna Mbaeke told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu that vigilance groups should work with the police. According to him, they must remain under the supervision and guidance of divisional police officers. Mbaeke said: “At all times, they must apprehend and hand over any suspect to the police. They should not detain any person or operate unauthorised detention camps.’’ He said the government established neighbourhood watch groups to complement statutorily recognised security agencies, as they were closer to the grassroots. The commissioner enjoined members to show integrity and operate within the ambit of the law. He reiterated government’s commitment to support security agencies. Mbaeke advised them to work with traditional institutions. “Vigilance group members must assist the government to achieve the set target of security and development at the grassroots. “Any deviation from the law establishing the programme will attract sanctions,’’ the commissioner said.
