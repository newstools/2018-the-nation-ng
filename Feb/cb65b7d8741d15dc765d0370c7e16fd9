 Sergio Aguero welcomed his son onto the pitch after Manchester City’s 3-0 win over Arsenal in the Carabao Cup final as the striker celebrated with his No 1 fan. Benjamin was pictured smiling with his father as they toasted City’s first silverware of the season after the showpiece final. The nine-year-old is also the grandson of Diego Maradona and was born to the legendary footballer’s daughter Gianinna and Aguero back in 2009. The CIty striker and Maradona no longer maintain a good relationship after Aguero broke up with Giannina six years ago. Aguero scored City’s opener on Sunday with a delightful chip over David Ospina after taking advantage of a lapse in concentration from Shkodran Mustafi, who failed to deal with a goal-kick from Claudio Bravo. City would go on to seal the victory with second-half goals from captain Vincent Kompany and David Silva as they ran out comfortable winners at Wembley. The result saw City clinch their first silverware of the Pep Guardiola era since the former Barcelona manager joined at the start of last season. City look set to add the Premier League title later this season with a 13-point lead over second-placed Manchester United and a game-in-hand over their rivals. They are 4-0 up from the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash with Basel but were dumped out of the FA Cup by League One Wigan.
