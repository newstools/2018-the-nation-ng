Veronica, the wife of the former Minister of Interior, Abba Morro, is dead. She died after a brief illness in Abuja. Since the news of Mrs. Moro’s death was announced, the Abuja home of the ex- minister has become a beehive of activities with sympathizers trooping to the place to sign the condolence register.
