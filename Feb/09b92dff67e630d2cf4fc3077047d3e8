Coscharis Motors Plc,  BMW brand representative in Nigeria, has ended the celebration of love with its customers through the Valentine Special promo for select BMW variants. It started on February 12 and ended on February 19. The Valentine promo was intended to show its love commitment to customers and prospects alike. “We were celebrating the love season with a special price package for the BMW 435, BMW 218, BMW 6 Series and some MINI cars. In addition to the special price package, we were further offering free one- year service plan, free registration and free weekend demo to buyers of any BMW variant within this period,” Coscharis Group General Manager, Marketing and Corporate Communications, Abiona Babarinde said. Customers, he said, would still benefit from the  two-year warranty or 60,000km or whichever comes first and an optional of four years extended warranty. This is continuing in the quest to offer buyers peace of mind and confidence that they are driving a high-quality product. “Our customers desire the very best love gift, which epitomises style, luxury, prestige, performance and peace of mind. We want to assure them that they can enjoy all these from our BMW variants for their driving pleasure,’’ he added.
