•Soldiers arrest suspect with bullet-proof vest Farmers in Tiv land have lamented that despite the presence of soldiers in their settlements, Fulani militia still destroy their crops and houses. A military exercise, Operation Cat Race, is on in Logo and Guma Local Government areas of Benue State. Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt. Gen. Tukur Buratai, who launched the exercise in Gbajimba, Guma council, said it is to flush out killer herdsmen and restore peace so that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) can return home. However, when The Nation visited Asege, Tse Gbeleve, Agboko, Anyibe, Tse Dzungwe and Ibor, in Tombo ward, Logo council, most villages were deserted. The villagers said the Fulani militia seem to have returned with more force. A victim, Unande Utor, said Fulani militia have looted their property and destroyed their yam seeds. Another victim in Anyibe, Terzungwe Azua, alleged that the destruction of crops had increased since soldiers came to the area. Azua said they were better under the police, who responded to attacks on their farmland and crops. They alleged that the soldiers looked the other side while the Fulani destroyed their houses. Chairman of Logo council Richard Nyajo said he would report to the military to step up operation in abandoned settlements. Police spokesman Moses Yamu said he was yet to get the report. Troops in Benue State have arrested a herdsman with a locally-made bullet proof vest and cutlass at Chegba, Logo Local Government Area. A statement by Col. Aliyu Yusuf yesterday said the suspect had been handed over to the police. Yusuf added that troops in Taraba State intervened in a clash between hunters and herdsmen in Obi Local Government Area, and seized a locally-made pistol with live cartridge at Gidan Kiya, Ibbi Local Government Area. He urged residents to cooperate with troops by providing information and report any suspicious movement to security agencies.
