 The International Olympic Committee have lifted their suspension of Russia just few days after the curtain fell on the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang South Korea. The decision was announced by the Russian Olympic Committee on Wednesday, and later confirmed by the IOC. President Alexander Zhukov stated that the remaining doping tests on the neutral Olympic Athletes from Russia team had come back negative from Pyeongchang 2018. Russia was banned from the Olympics because of a massive doping scandal at the 2014 Sochi Games. Two of more than 160 athletes competing as Olympic Athletes from Russia in South Korea tested positive for banned substances, including a curler who had to forfeit his bronze medal. Aleksandr Krushelnitckiy was stripped of his mixed doubles curling bronze medal after failing a doping test, while bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva tested positive for banned stimulant trimetazidine. The confirmation means Russia have been reinstated just three days after the end of the Winter Games. ‘Today we received a letter from the IOC about the restoration,’ said Zhukov. ‘The restoration of the ROC was connected with the end of the doping tests from the Olympics in Pyeongchang, the IOC can confirm that all other results are negative. ‘It means that the ROC is fully restored in its rights.’ The letter sent by Pere Miro, the IOC’s National Olympic Committees relations said: ‘On behalf of the Olympic Athlete from Russia implementation group, I wish to inform you that, following the IOC Executive Board decision on February 25, 2018, the final notification has now been received from the Doping Free Sports Unit and the IOC can confirm that all the remaining results from the OAR delegation are negative. ‘Consequently, the second point of the IOC EB decision on February 25 comes into effect automatically and immediately. ‘This means that the ROC can again exercise all rights and duties conferred upon it by the Olympic Charter, as any other National Olympic Committee.’
