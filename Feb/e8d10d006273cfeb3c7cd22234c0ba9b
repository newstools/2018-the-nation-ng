For the third time in one week, a Federal government delegation visited Yobe to sympathise with the state governor, Ibrahim Gaidam, over the abduction of some girls at Government Girls’ Science Technical College, Dapchi. Those on the delegation that visited the state on Tuesday were the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Muhammad Babagana Munguno (retd) and Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Sadique  Abubakar. They met the governor and other stakeholders to discuss the progress report on the missing girls. According to the NSA, their visit was in solidarity with government and people of Yobe State. He said: “We identified with the current situation the people of Yobe State find themselves.  I have a goodwill message from President Muhammadu Buhari to commiserate with you though federal government delegations had come. “It is the primary responsibility that rest not only on the President’s shoulder but on mine and all my colleagues who are here. “So far within the last few days activities have been structured by meeting the President to discuss the situation.  The Theatre Command has started working hard on the search 24 hours non- stop.  The Nigerian Air Force has deployed 20 aircrafts to Maiduguri and eight others are on their way.  So far 200 hours have been spent searching for the missing girls.” He assured that the federal government would not relent in deploying all resources to ensure that the girls are rescued safe and alive, adding that measures will equally be put in place  to forestall any reoccurrence of such incident. Governor Gaidam said he is energized by the seriousness demonstrated by the federal government on the matter. “This visit being the third by the federal government has energized and served as motivating factor. This is aimed at ensuring that the missing school girls are returned to their parents in good health,” Gaidam said.
