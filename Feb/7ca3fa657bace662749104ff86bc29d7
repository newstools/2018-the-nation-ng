President Mohammadu Buhari on Thursday asked governors on the platform of the All Progressive Congress, (APC) to give him more time to decide whether or not he was going to contest the 2019 presidential election. The President told the governors led by Imo State governors, Rochas Okorocha at a meeting held at the First Lady Conference Room in the villa, Abuja. Buhari, according to Okorocha, in an interview with Statehouse correspondents said the president asked for  more time to decide on the matter. “We discussed so many issues that affect the nation, our party and Mr President’s ambition to run for 2019 elections. “Anyhow, Mr President in his usual manner has requested that we give him time and that he will address the nation and the caucus of the party very soon. “So we should be full of expectations that Mr President will make officially known to Nigerians his intentions. “But we hope that his response will be in line with what the governors are thinking, as it is the desire of the governors that the President seeks re-election in view of his tremendous performances in the last two and half years.’’ he said. The governors had earlier in the day attended a National Council of State meeting. Buhari, last week in Daura, Katsina had hosted the APC governors when they paid him a condolence visit on the death of his two family members. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo and Ibrahim Babangida had in an open letter addressed to the president asked him not to contest the 2019 presidential election
