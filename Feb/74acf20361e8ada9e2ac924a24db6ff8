Ex-Big Brother Africa contestant, model and TV personality Vimbai Mutinhiri is taking on new and bigger projects this year as she joins co-hosts Bolanle Olukanmi and Laulah Doherty on Moments Nigeria. Moments Nigeria is an African talk show (a spin-off of Moments with Mo) with a selection of hosts from Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and South Africa discussing on key matters that touches Africa, her diverse cultures and peoples. Having carved a niche for herself on the continent as one of the most sought-after TV and show hosts, Vimbai now forges a new alliance with Ebony Life TV as co-host on Moments Nigeria. The 31 year old TV personality with prior hosting experience has been chosen to replace Toke Makinwa in the talk show’s fourth season. Previously, she hosted gigs such as Africa Magic Star Gist, Africa Magic Viewer’s Choice Awards and has modeled on the runway for South African Fashion Week and Zimbabwe Fashion Week.
