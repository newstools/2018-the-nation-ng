An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Ekiti State, Dr. Wole Oluyede, has said that the ambition of former Governors Segun Oni and Kayode Fayemi will divide the party, ahead of the July 14 poll. He advised the two politicians to emulate their senior colleague, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo, by playing the roles of leaders and statesmen. Oluyede said the unity of the party and its success at the poll should be paramount to Oni and Fayemi, warning that joining the race would reduce them to “aspirants and not leaders.” Oluyede, who spoke with reporters in Ikere-Ekiti, his home town,  said the party would face some challenges, ahead of the primary. While Oni, who served as governor between 2007 and 2010, has  declared interest, Fayemi, who was in office between 2010 and 2014, is yet to throw his hat into the ring. Oluyede said: “I want the two former governors (Oni and Fayemi) to recognise themselves as leaders, they did their best. I wish our two eminent leaders, Engineer Segun Oni and Dr. Kayode Fayemi will remain as leaders and keep their national offices. “The signs are there that we may not win the net election if we present any of them as our candidate in the election and their participation in the primary will aggravate our division and their non-participation will make them better men. He added: “If they win in the primary, are will sure we will win the main election? If they come to the field, they will reduce themselves to aspirants and not as leaders. “Their presence in the race will also deepen the divisions and relinquishing their aspirations for the sake of the party will notmake them feel less in any way.
