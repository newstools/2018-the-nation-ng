Both the governor and the senator are members of the ruling party. This was contained in the reaction of the group to the statement credited to the governor of Ondo State, Mr Rotimi Akeredolu, that Senator Ajayi Boroffice is not a member of the All Progressives Congress. In a press release signed by its coordinator, Comrade Akinsola Olagbegi, the group also said Governor Akeredolu is not more committed to the ideals and ideologies of APC than Senator Boroffice. “Obviously, the remark made by the governor is misleading. The remark has the potency to reignite and trigger conflicts and crises within the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State. “Like the Press has reported, Senator Boroffice is a member of the All Progressives Congress. His membership of the APC is not subject of debate and discord. It is uncontestable. “As the 2019 general elections get nearer, we believe all party leaders and members should set aside individual differences in order to work in unison for the electoral success of the party at all levels. The APC is big enough for all our party members to operate. “Finally, we wish to express confidence in the Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu-led presidential committee that has the mandate to ensure reconciliation and confidence building towards improving cohesion within the party. “Furthermore, the reconciliatory committee should make Ondo State the priority on the list of States to be visited. The intervention of the committee is essential because the support base of the governor is not up to 30% membership strength of the party. This fact was corroborated by the scanty crowd that attended the purported unification rally the governor hosted on Saturday. It is crystal clear that without genuine reconciliation between party leaders and the rank and file of the APC in Ondo State, the party will lose the 2019 general elections,” the statement read.
