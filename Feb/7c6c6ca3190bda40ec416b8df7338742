A COUPLE,   Valentine and Stella Anyakaora, has been arrested for allegedly battering their nine-year-old maid, Favour Chiamaka. The incident occurred at 2, Dominic Street, Ijegun, on the outskirts of Lagos. They were arrested by policemen attached to Ijegun, Satellite Division following a complaint by a rights group. A man was said to have seen the child looking scruffy with an injury, which was almost chopping off on her fingers. The man was said to have realised that she was being maltreated after questioning her. The couple, it was learnt,  brought her to Lagos from the east after promising her parents that  they would  train her. A social media user, Iyke Nzelibe, said there were obvious marks of violence on the child’s body, adding that she lived under torture; was subjected to hard labour and was poorly fed. Nzelibe said: “The poor girl was sent on an errand yesterday to buy something when a good samaritan met her in a nearby store with decayed, maggot feasted fingers. “The good samaritan intervened by getting human rights involved in the case. The woman’s husband was arrested. His wife was nowhere to be found. Mothers, please, be mindful of the people you give your kids to.” Police spokesman, Chike Oti, a Superintendent (SP),  said the suspects would be charged to court  after investigation.
