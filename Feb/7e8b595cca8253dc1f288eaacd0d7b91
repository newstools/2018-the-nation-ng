Life must go on is probably the best way to capture the action of former Dortmund and Gunners new buy  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Arsenal may have suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Manchester City in Sunday’s EFL Cup final. But Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang didn’t let their embarrassing 3-0 loss by Pep Guardiola’s side prevent him from enjoying himself on Monday night. The striker, who became Arsenal’s record signing when he arrived from Borussia Dortmund for £56million in January, was seen leaving Nobu Berkeley Street alongside his girlfriend Alysha Behague. Aubameyang is famed for his flashy lifestyle and he and Behague were pictured heading away from the restaurant in an incredible gold Range Rover. The striker, who wore a sparkling jacket and high-top trainers, was enjoying some down time a day on from Arsenal’s crushing defeat by Manchester City Sergio Aguero, Vincent Kompany and David Silva all got on the scoresheet as Guardiola picked up his first trophy since taking over the Premier League club. Arsene Wenger’s players came in for heavy criticism for their display on Sunday. But Jack Wilshere claimed that two of City’s goals should not have been allowed to stand and that City should have been reduced to 10 men. Writing on Instagram, Wilshere made a case for Aguero’s opener being disallowed for a foul on Shkodran Mustafi, before suggesting that Kompany’s strike should have been ruled out because Leroy Sane was offside and interfering with play. ‘City are a good team and deserved to win yesterday. A lot of people have had their say on us and we have to accept criticism when we lose that being said I can’t accept some of the decisions that went against us. ‘Whatever you say about the first goal it was a foul. The second goal is offside. There should have been a second yellow in the first half. ‘Yes this happens in football but it’s still hard to accept. And people will say we are looking for excuses but these are facts.’
