If you follow the popular reality show that got Naija talking right now, you will probably see reasons why we have decided to crush on this young man Tobi Bakre. We are obviously talking about Big Brother Nigeria 2018. Firstly, BBNaija’s Tobi seems to have some charisma and charm of being a leader after all, he has won the head of house challenge again making him a 3rd-time Head of House. Tobi, was born on June 1, 1990 into a family of four. He graduated from the University of Lagos in 2012, where he studied Banking and Finance.  I always had him as a #yorubademon regardless of the hashtag #PrayforTobi which became the trending topic on social media as many believed, he was under ‘Cee-C’s spell’ He is the youngest child who enjoys having eggs and plantain. Tobi, as a multi-talented person, enjoys dancing, poetry, singing drawing and most of all, he has got a passion for photography and honestly, being the third head of house would have been enough to make him our MCM of the week .
