The Chief Medical Director (CMD) of the University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital, UITH, Ilorin, Kwara State, Prof Waheed O. Olatinwo, has described infertility as a global problem. Olatinwo, who delivered the 178th Inaugural Lecture of the University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara State, titled Help for the helpless and hope for the hopeless: The medicine of reproductive possibility, at the university main campus recently, claimed “generally, the prevalence is about 10-15%, but reports from sub-Saharan Africa ranges from 20-26% depending on the population, while up to 20-30% has been reported in Nigeria.” He also stated that about 180 million couples are infertile globally, with a major contribution of these from developing countries. According to the Obstetrics and Gynaecology (O & G) specialist, when all attempts, orthodox or traditional, to become fertile and then produce children fail, “an infertile couple becomes helpless and hopelessness may set in.” Olatinwo said after several couples with infertility problems find no respite to the problem, some give up and accept their ‘fate’ while others employ the blame-game. He, however, enthused that there’s help for the helpless and hope for the hopeless, through what is referred to as Assisted Reproductive Technology, ART. Olatinwo stated that it’s ‘medicine of reproductive possibility’. ART, according to him, “refers to all treatments or procedures that include in-vitro handling of the human oocyte and spermatozoa or embryo for the purpose of establishing pregnancy.”
