The management of Parties and Eventz, an event and protocol company based in Lagos, is organising an exciting two weeks’ intensive photography session for both amateur and professional photographers in Lagos. The maiden edition of the digital photography training session, which will focus on current trends in the photograph, is scheduled to hold from tomorrow February 26th to March 9th 2018 in Ikeja, Lagos. The Managing Director of the company, Mrs Abiola Scott, assured that seasoned professional photographers will be on ground to take the participants through the various aspects of photography and its latest technological applications. The estate management graduate added that the training is going to be a new dawn in the digital photography world as participants will experience new innovations, through theory and practical training, in a conducive atmosphere. According to her, “photography is beyond the act of posing before a camera and printing it on a paper.” Scott, who is deeply passionate about the act of photography, traced her love with the lens to the influence of her father, who she described as a master in the act, during her early days as a teenager.
