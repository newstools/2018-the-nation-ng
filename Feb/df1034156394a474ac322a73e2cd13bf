  Nigeria wrestling team have temporarily resumed training ahead of the 2018 Commonwealth Games billed for Australia between 4 and 15 April 2018. The wrestlers had boycotted their training camp last week in protest of the nonpayment of their accumulated allowances for various African and International Wrestling Championships. One of the wrestlers who did not want to be named, told NationSport that the team decided to resume training in order not to jeopardize their chances of winning medals as usual at the Gold Coast 2018. “The ministry is yet to pay us our allowances but we have given them time and resumed training. In as much as we are fighting for what is due to us, we are still mindful of the Commonwealth Games because we don’t want it to affect our performances in Australia,” Meanwhile, NationSport gathered that the President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation, Daniel Igali and other federation presidents met with the Minister of Youths and Sports, Solomon Dalung and the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Olusade Adesola in Abuja on Tuesday. Igali said that the meeting was to strategize ahead of the the Commonwealth Games, even as he confirmed the wrestlers return to training. “I am just going back to Bayelsa from Abuja where we discussed with the minister, permanent secretary and some of the officials on some issues. “The minister met with all the federation presidents that are going for the Commonwealth Games to discuss plans, training tour schedules, issues that are affecting the teams and so on.
