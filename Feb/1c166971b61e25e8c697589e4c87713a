 Former Super Eagles coach and Captain, Sunday Oliseh is not one to allow himself be depressed over turn of event. The suspended coach of Dutch second division side Fortuna Sittard, is rather catching his fun and putting the time he would have been using to shout out orders by the side of the pitch to attend to his hobbies. Oliseh who did not hesitate in countering his employers charge that he is making it difficult for staff and players to work with him took to the social media to express his satisfaction with the quality of wave making new movie ‘Black panther’ he has just watched describing it as a must watch. “Wow! Just saw the Black Panther. Arguably the best super Hero movie i ever saw. Loved every minute of it! A must see!” he enthused Following his recent suspension, Fortuna Sittard and Oliseh are taking the wait-and-see posture as the club did not specify how long the suspension will last. Oliseh had shortly after the suspension accused his employers of trying to force him to act unprofessionally saying   I confirm: Due to my refusal to participate in Illegal activities at Fortuna sittard & violate the Law,i have been Suspended from my duties as Coach by the Foreign Owners of Fortuna. Unfortunate for the lovely fans, my players & our hard fought phenomenal positioning for Promotion,” Sittard has threatened to drag the former Nigerian international to court over his claims that they were forcing him to break the law, but there are no indications that the club has hit the court yet. Oliseh took the decision to settle for Sittard shortly after leaving the Super Eagles job with CHAN 2016 edition in Rwanda as his last assignment for the national team.
