Former Majority Leader of the Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Funminiyi Afuye, has thrown his weight behind the choice of Dr. Wole Oluyede as the All Progressives Congress (APC) preferred candidate from Ikere-Ekiti. Afuye condemned the opposition of two aspirants, Muyiwa Olumilua and Kola Alabi, to Oluyede’s selection, saying it was wrong for the duo to have agreed to the process at a private parley and come out to condemn it in the open. He hailed the role played by Ikere Development Forum (IDF) led by eminent lawyer, Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), in narrowing down Ikere’s APC aspirants to one, arguing that the process was democratic and not an imposition. The five APC aspirants who participated in the process were Oluyede, Afuye, Olumilua, Alabi and Chief Sesan Fatoba. But Olumilua, son of a former governor, and Alabi have vowed to go ahead with their ambition and declared their readiness to participate in the state APC primary election. Olanipekun and other IDF members, in a bid to enhance Ikere’s chances of producing the next governor, called five APC aspirants from the town together at a meeting held in Lagos from February 11 to 12 and urged them to pick someone among themselves. When the aspirants could not agree among themselves who should be the town’s APC consensus candidate, they all agreed that the group should choose one of them and Oluyede, a medical practitioner and investor, emerged as the choice.
