NOT that Mo Abudu’s ‘Royal Hibiscus Hotel’ is really comparable to Disney-Marvel’s “Black Panther”. It just so happened that this Hollywood film of predominantly black actors set in Africa began running in Nigerian cinemas in the same month of love. The formers outstanding performance around the world had its mark in Nigeria, has the leading film in cinemas from record of its opening weekend alone. Not that it is unusual for a Hollywood film to beat our local productions in Nigeria; the likes of Ayo Makun and Mo Abudu have raised our hopes with sales records that have dwarfed some foreign films running the same time race with us. For example, The Wedding Party wowed us with the record for the biggest weekend opening for a Nigerian movie after making N36m in cinemas across Nigeria in December 2016. Its sequel, The Wedding Party: Destination Dubai doubled that record with N73million in its opening weekend on Dec. 15-17, 2017, beating out Star Wars: The Last Jedi in Nigerian cinemas, which also opened that weekend. There seems to be new lessons from the feat of Black Panther which raked in N135million in its opening weekend and as at Thursday, N200million. We do not know how much Royal Hibiscus Hotel made, but sources say it was far from the records of The Wedding Party let alone anywhere near Black Panther. If we know Mo Abudu well, she may want to try her hand on an ‘original’ African story with Hollywood African cast – perhaps an action film too – if that’s what will turn in N135million in an opening weekend.
