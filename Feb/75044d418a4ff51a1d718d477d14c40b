The Managing Director, Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA), Captain Fola Akinkuotu, has extolled the impact of women engineers in socio-economic development. Akinkuotu spoke at the investiture of Felicia Agubata as the 15th president of the  Association of Professional Women Engineers of Nigeria (APWEN) in Lagos. He noted that Nigeria’s history would be incomplete without mentioning the role of women engineers who have made indelible contributions to its technological advancement. He described the new president, a staff member of NAMA, as a woman of valour, persistence and hard work who has transformed  NAMA Engineering Department within her few years in the agency. “If given the opportunity and enabling environment, women like Agubata, would continue to excel in their endeavours,’’ Akinkuotu said. He praised the leadership and members of APWEN for the investiture of Agubata, noting that it was an honour. Agubata promised to uphold the dignity of women engineers and to serve the profession and humanity well. Acknowledging the challenges ahead, especially the expectations from the engineering community and stakeholders, Agubata promised to focus on capacity building to mobilise necessary human and material resources and create value for the good of the society in line with the mission of APWEN. “There is no research work that has shown that one gender is stronger or weaker than the other, both sexes when given the exposures, training and orientation, the outcome will be very interesting. To guarantee continuous progress, both sexes must complement and support each other. This will ensure that our potential as one humanity is maximised across all spheres,” he said. She said the association members should work together to meet the  needs of the society and to improve human experience and expand opportunities for the emerging woman.
