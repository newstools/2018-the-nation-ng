A Lagos socialite and philanthropist, Prince Kazeem Eletu-Odibo,  has dissociated himself from a suspected   killer, Adeola Williams  aka Ade Lawyer, who was  paraded last week by the police. Ade Lawyer was apprehended alongside former Lagos State Chapter of the  National Union Road of Transport Workers (NURTW) Chairman Alhaji Rafiu Akanni Olohunwa for the killing of Ganiyu Ayinla, personal assistant to the NURTW Chairman in Idumota, Azeez Lawal. Ade Lawyer claimed that he was contracted by Olohunwa to kill Lawal aka Kunle Poly. He also alleged that he had worked for many influential Nigerians, including Prince Kazeem, the youngest son of the late  Lagos white cap chief, Gbadamosi Bamidele Eletu-Odibo. Prince Eletu-Odibo said the suspect had never worked for him, adding that he saw him once, when he came with some area boys during a dispute over a land boundary. He said: “It wasn’t even a physical fight. Nobody exchanged blows at all. It was just a verbal disagreement with the man who also claimed the (disputed) land belongs to his family. “We were surrounded by area boys, some of whom always hail me anytime they came across me and as a kind gesture, I do give them money. So, this bearer (Ade Lawyer) was among them. He came with one NURTW official that day. While the argument was ongoing, the police from the Ilasan Station at Lekki/Ajah came and invited us to their station. That was the first and the last time I met this fellow (Ade Lawyer). “We were transferred to Area J Command and both sides were asked to bring relevant documents which we did. At the end, the Area Commander instructed both parties to maintain peace and return to the status quo based on the Supreme Court judgment in favour of our family as the rightful owner of the land’’.
