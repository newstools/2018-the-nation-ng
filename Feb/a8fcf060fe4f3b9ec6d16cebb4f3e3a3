The Chairman of Ohaozara Local Government of Ebonyi State, Mrs. Nkechinyere Iyioku, has donated 300 KVA transformer each to three communities. They are Uburu, Okposi and Ugwulanugwu. Mrs. Mary Okoronkwoede, an indigent widow from Okposi Achara, got one-bedroom apartment from the council boss. She made the donation yesterday at the local government secretariat. Iyioku said the gesture was the council’s way of complementing the effort of the governor’s wife, Mrs. Rachael Umahi, in transforming indigent people’s lives. She said the transformers would boost socio-economic activities. “I was motivated by the widow’s plight. She has been squatting with relatives following her house, which collapsed. “I also donated to emulate the leadership style of the governor and his wife, especially in uplifting people’s lives,’’ Iyioku said. The National Vice Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Southeast, Mr. Austin Umahi, hailed the governor’s wife for laying a good foundation for women’s participation in politics. “Ebonyi people are grateful for your achievements made through your pet project, Family Succour and Uplift Foundation. We urge you not to relent,” Umahi, who is also the chairman of the occasion, said.
