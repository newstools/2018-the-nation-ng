A release date has been set for the Netflix debut of ‘Vaya’, the award winning film by South Africa-based Nigerian filmmaker, Akin Omotoso. The film, which made its World Premiere at 2016 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) was earlier acquired by ARRAY. ARRAY is an independent distribution company launched by filmmaker and former publicist Ava DuVernay in 2010 under the name African-American Film Festival Releasing Movement. In 2015, the company rebranded itself as ARRAY. ”Vaya” is set for its Netflix debut alongside an international tour across South America and Europe. Ava DuVernay announced Tuesday that her film collective, Array Releasing, has acquired their 19th feature with ”Vaya”. The South Africa-based coming-of-age drama from the Nigerian filmmaker has been fixed for a November 1, 2018 debut on Netflix, the popular internet movie channel. ARRAY has acquired distribution rights in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand territories. Akin Omotoso centers the film on South Africa’s diverse communities to explore the universal experiences related to coming of age,” explained Array’s Vice President Tilane Jones. The 2016 feature film won three awards at the Africa Movie Academy Awards last year, including ‘Best Director’. It was also selected as one of South Africa’s submissions for ‘Best Foreign Language Film’ at the 90th Academy Awards. “We’re excited to add this vibrant work to Array’s catalog and we look forward to sharing its message of hope in the face of adversity with an international audience.” Array Releasing had earlier in the year also acquired the second feature film from female filmmaker C.Fitz.Array, ”Jewel’s Catch One” as it continues to expand its inclusive slate of films and storytelling.
