•Envoy visits APC candidate’s campaign office Ahead of the September 22 governorship election in Osun State, the Consular-General of the Embassy of the United States of America (U.S.A) in Nigeria, Mr. John Bray, has called for a free, fair and transparent election. The Consular-General, who spoke yesterday at the IleriOluwa Campaign Organisation in Osogbo, the state capital, said he was in the state to know the candidates of all political parties contesting the election. He said his visit was meant to show the commitment of the U.S.A to democracy and support its process. Bray, who also said he was in Osun to interact with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agencies to assess the situation ahead of the poll, added that knowing the candidates, the process and the players before the election would enable him and his team to know the position of things and write a report for the international community. The envoy said the U.S was not interested in any candidate but supporting democracy to increase the quality of elections. Oyetola hailed the U.S for its commitment to democracy. The APC candidate assured the envoy that his party was determined to ensure a free, fair and credible election. He described the direct primary method adopted by APC to pick its flag bearer as the best, participatory and cheap. Oyetola noted that it was an innovation that should be replicated across the country. The APC candidate urged the U.S to continue to support Nigeria and even do more for the nation’s federating components in many other areas. He said Osun State under the Rauf Aregbesola administration had become a model for other states in various sectors of the economy, especially in education, agriculture, health, among others.
