No fewer than 15,694 Nigerians are currently in Madinah and Makkah, Saudi Arabia for this yearâ€™s Hajj, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. The pilgrims who started arriving in the Holy land on July 21, were transported by Max Air Limited, FLY NAS and Medview airlines in 38 flights from various destinations including Abuja, Lagos and Kano. The figures were provided in a NAHCON flight statistics obtained by NAN on Monday in Madinah. The latest flight by FLY NASS on Monday transported 218 prospective pilgrims from Kebbi to Madinah, while 2,707 of the total number of the pilgrims are already in Makkah to begin the formal Hajj rites. Transportation of pilgrims from the six designated airports in Nigeria continues. Meanwhile, officials of the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON), headed by its Madinah Coordinator, Alhaji Ahmed Maigari, on Monday returned the Basic Traveling Allowance (BTA) to a Nasarawa State pilgrim, Nuhu Musa, who lost the money. Musa had lost 606 dollars and N10,000 cash in his hotel accommodation; but one of the hotel workers, who found it, promptly handed it over to the management which in turn alerted the NAHCON leader. Maigari, at the handing over ceremony, cautioned pilgrims against careless handling of their BTA. He advised them to be vigilant and careful in transacting business deals and commended the hotel workers for being honesty. Maigari handed over the amount to Alhaji Ahmed Yusuf, an official of Nasarawa State Pilgrims Board, who gave it to Musa. (NAN)
