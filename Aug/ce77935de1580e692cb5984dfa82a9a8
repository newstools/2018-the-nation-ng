THE All Progressives Congress (APC) camp in Sokoto State was in a festive mood yesterday preparatory to the arrival of the APC leader in the state, Senator Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko, today. Wamakko, who is expected to be accompanied into town by Deputy Governor Ahmed Aliyu Sokoto and Senator Ibrahim Abdullahi Gobi, will address party supporters who have been massing in the state capital awaiting his arrival. The former governor had said, earlier in the week, that those who were writing off the APC, following the defection of Governor Aminu Tambuwwal and 18 members of the state’s House of Assembly to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), should wait till this weekend when he returns to Sokoto and see whether the APC is still in control or not. Over the last few days, a lot of Sokoto residents have been expressing support for President Muhammadu Buhari openly, chanting pro-Buhari slogans. Women and youth in particular displayed their joy amidst “Rarara’s” musical songs “Masu Gudu, Su Gudu (those who want to go can go).” Similarly, posters of President Buhari, Senator Wamakko are displayed in many parts of the state capital. Also accompanying Wamakko to Sokoto today are seven members of the House of Representatives from the state; the chairman of APC in the state, Alhaji Farouk Malami Yabo, and Alhaji Sadik Isah Achida, among other notable politicians.
