Nollywood actor and Enugu State governorship aspirant Kenneth Okonkwo has reacted to criticisms for his comments rallying Igbo’s support for President Muhammadu Buhari’s 2019 campaign and that Igbo should wait for 2023 to contest the presidency. “My attention has been drawn to some negative comments and curses poured out against my person by some ignorant and satanically motivated persons because of my preference of President Muhammadu Buhari as President of this country for his incorruptible and firm character against enemies of Nigeria,” said Okonkwo, who is also a lawyer. “Let me reiterate that I am a follower of President Buhari and believe in his integrity and good intentions to better the lots of Nigerians and that of Ndigbo and I have no apologies for this. Whoever disagrees with me should produce his own strong reasons and better alternatives.” While speaking at a political meeting last week in Enugu, Okonkwo said: “If the South East shall support any other person for the presidency, they are going to spend the next eight years in the wilderness.” “It has been agreed that it is their turn after President Buhari. Our slogan is Ndigbo for President Buhari 2019 and then President Buhari for Ndigbo 2023.”
