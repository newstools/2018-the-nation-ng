Six female pupils who recently won gold in a Technovation competition at the Silicon Valley in San Francisco, the United States of America (U.S.A), yesterday got scholarships from Anambra State Governor Willie Obiano. The awardees, all from the state, also got N1 million each from the governor, who announced his readiness to sponsor the girls to the university for their first degree. Congratulating the beneficiaries at the Governor’s Lodge, Obiano said the girls had dazzled the world with their talent and outstanding brilliance. The governor said he was particularly excited that the talents of the average Anambra indigene were further spreading under his watch. He pledged continuous celebration of those who make the state proud. Obiano said: “We all adorn the colour of the Regina Pacis Model School today as a mark of honour for the school. “The girls have broken old stereotypes that blacks were inferior. The girls have shown that our people, given the right platform, can perform. The average Anambra man is a fearless man. I charged them to go and do us proud and they did.
