One held on August 1, the other three days later. Both held in Sokoto, the seat of the Caliphate. It was a show of strength for two former allies, now political adversaries: Governor Aminu Tambuwal and Senator Aliyu Wamakko. In 2015, Wamakko shut his door against other aspirants and railroaded Tambuwal into office as his successor. Tambuwal was then Speaker of the House of Representatives. Fast forward to a little over three years after, Tambuwal and Wamakko are on different pages politically. The governor last Wednesday dumped the All Progressives Congress (APC) for his former political party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He described the APC as the home of the corrupt and said it was time Nigerians rejected prison democracy practised by the APC-led Federal Government. His defection rally witnessed a massive crowd. It was planned to be a statement of his popularity in the state, but his erstwhile godfather fought back three days later with a crowd, which if described with any word other than massive will amount to injustice. Since these shows of strength by these two gladiators, analysts are of the view that both men are ‘on ground’ politically. Each of them also controls sizeable members of the House of Assembly and other big wigs in the historical state. At this stage, analysts are at a loss as to who will have the upper hand. What is not in doubt is that neither can lay claim to being sure of landslide victory if the polls are opened today.
