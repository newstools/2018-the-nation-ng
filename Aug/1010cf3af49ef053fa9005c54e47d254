The Edo State Governor, Mr Godwin Obaseki, has paid a condolence visit to the Edo South Senatorial leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Gentleman Amegor, over the death of his son, Uyi Amegor. The late Uyi Amegor, was the Vice Chairman of Egor Local Government Area, until his death. Obaseki was accompanied on the visit by his Chief of Staff, Chief Taiwo Akerele, and the Commissioner for Communication and Orientation, Hon. Paul Ohonbamu. The visibly shaken governor, who could not speak to journalists, spent some time condoling with the Amegor family at their Siluko Road residence, in Benin City, the state capital. Recall that when news of Uyi Amegor’s death broke earlier in the week, the governor expressed rude shock at the news and said he was taken aback by the passing of Hon. Uyi Amegor. “I commiserate with his family, Edo South Leader of our party, Gentleman Amegor and the people of Egor local council. We lost Mr. Uyi Amegor at a critical moment of our development as a state, when he was working with the team at the local government to re-position local government administration. It is indeed a great loss to the people of Egor local council and the entire state,” Obaseki said. He pledged that the Edo State Government and the entire APC family will stand by the Amegor family through their trying moments and prayed that God grants the family the fortitude to bear the huge loss.
