The Federal Government has commenced a review of the Monthly allowance paid to corps members, Director General, National Youth Service Corps, Brig. Gen. Suleiman Kazaure, has disclosed. He said the NYSC, through the Ministry of Youth and Sport Development received a letter from the Presidency indicating that the process to review the allowance of corps members had started. Kazaure said the Presidency also copied the Ministry of Finance in the letter. The DG disclosed this during a tour of the NYSC orientation camp at the nation’s capital on Thursday. He said: “The federal government is working to increase your monthly allowance therefore, wherever you find yourselves conduct yourself well, be good ambassador of your family, the scheme and the nation. “We received a letter from the presidency, that is, ministry of youth and sport, copied the ministry of finance that shows that the corps allowance will be reviewed upward, it is in the pipeline.” He urged the corps members to reciprocate the government gesture by taking advantage of the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development (SAED) of the NYSC so that they can assist government by creating jobs. Kazaure said the corps members should consider themselves privileged to serve the nation, urging them to patriotic and uphold the mandate of the scheme. He said: “Immediately after your orientation, you will be posted out, you should respect the tradition of your community. “Avoid indecent dressing and be security conscious, and avoid night party, night party is allowed in your lodge but aside your lodge this is not allowed.” Kazaure therefore gave his mobile numbers to enable the corps members reach him for any complain and information. The FCT state Coordinator, Mr Ballama Birniwa, said the DG has banned the use of firewood in the camp kitchen, adding that gas would be provided for cooking in the camp.
