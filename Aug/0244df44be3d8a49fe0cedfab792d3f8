The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has advised intending travellers to stop patronising unregistered travel agencies. The General Manager, Public Relations, NCAA, Mr Sam Adurogboye, gave the advice on Sunday in Lagos. Adurogboye explained that this was due to the increase in reports of fraudulent ticketing practices by unregistered travel agencies. He said the Nigeria Civil Aviation Regulations (Nig.CARs) 2015, Part 18.9.1 (111), prohibited the undertaking of the business of travel agency by any person in Nigeria without a Certificate of Registration or Licence issued by the authority. “Upon fulfilment of certain requirements, an applicant submits evidence of membership of National Association of Nigeria Travel Agents (NANTA) to NCAA. “In addition, Section 30 (4) of the Civil Aviation Act 2006 empowers the NCAA to regulate, supervise and monitor the activities of travel agents in the country,” he said in a statement. Adurogboye said consequent upon reports of sharp practices by unregistered travel agencies, the authority directed all duly registered travel agencies to display their certificates of registration or licences in all their outlets. The general managing noted that there were 150 travel agencies on the register of the NCAA. Adurogboye said the applicant must fulfil both the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and NCAA requirements before it could be registered. (NAN)
