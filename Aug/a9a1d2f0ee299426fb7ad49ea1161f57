Operatives of the Department of the State Security Service on Wednesday vacated the premises of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) following the sack of its Director-General Lawal Musa Daura. A high ranking official at the federation who begged not to be mentioned, said they were surprised to see them drive out without a word. ‘Well we thank God because we hardly work, once it’s 4 p.m. they will ask us to close and leave the premises.” NationSport can also report authoritatively that the members of the Giwa led-board were seen at the boardroom of the federation Sports Minister Solomon Dalung had earlier given an assurance that the DSS will vacate the glasshouse this week to enable the right person legally recognised by law to take charge of the activities of the federation even though he strongly believed that the Abdulmuminu Aminu-led committee will find a lasting solution to the crisis. “This administration is a government based on the rule of law and I will not allow any person who has no respect for Supreme Court judgement to run a parastatal under my watch.  The invasion of the NFF by the DSS was unacceptable and security stretched too far.  But I am happy that normalcy has returned to the glasshouse for now”.  said the Minister. Dalung who travelled to France ahead of today’s FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup second group D clash involving Nigeria and Haiti, expressed confidence that the Falconets will qualify from the group. “Don’t judge the team with their game against Germany. Falconets have a history in this competition and I know they will make it to the final. I will ensure that all their outstanding allowances and bonuses are paid, not even a dime will be owed to them. They are the main actors and must be encouraged,” he concluded.
