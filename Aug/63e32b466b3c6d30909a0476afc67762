The Edo State Agency for the Control of Aids (EDO SACA), in partnership with Ogbona Elites Forum, has concluded plans to assemble a team of experts on a medical outreach to Ogbona community, in Etsako Central Local Government Area of Edo State. In a statement, Vice President, Ogbona Elites Forum, Ikhane Bernard Kasim, noted that the medical outreach holds from September 1 to 3 and will complement the state government’s effort on healthcare delivery. He added that the team of experts consist of acute medical consultants, geriatricians, cardiologists and a stroke physician. Ikhane said the team will “be donating some medical equipment to the Community Health Center and the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Comprehensive Health Center, Ogbona, (Chief M.C.K. Orbih Comprehensive Health Center, Ogbona). He noted that the equipment includes: “ECG machines, along with other new devices, that can detect atrial fibrillation and hence reduce the incidence of stroke. These are the newest machines in the market and they are cloud-enabled.” The Executive Director, Edo State Agency for the Control of Aids (EDOSACA), Flora Oyakhilome, urged Edo people to take advantage of the medical outreach. Ikhane explained “the ECGs will be read in real time by a cardiologist in the United Kingdom who will do the analysis and send down the results immediately.  We expect to carry out about 10,000 tests with the cloud-enabled Technomed machines.  We will also be donating a powerful solar generator with a hybrid rack system which is also a new technology that produces portable water. “The team made up of seven foreign, 30 home-based medical doctors and eight nurses will be accompanied by directors and technicians of the supporting companies who will install the machines and ensure they work,” he added.
