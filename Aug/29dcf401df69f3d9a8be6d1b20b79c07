Guaranty Trust Bank plc will be launching its banking services on WhatsApp Business Solution. This will enable the lender to offer Nigerians additional channel to connect with the bank for enquiries, service requests and access to other basic banking services. This is in line with the bankâ€™s continued efforts to enhance service delivery and offer superior banking experiences to customers. Over the years, GTBank has been at the forefront of establishing a wide range of value-adding touch-points through which customers can access banking services and interact with the bank on all account-related enquiries at any time of the day. The bank was the first financial institution in Nigeria to set up a fully interactive contact center in 2006 and has, since then, led the finance sector in driving customer interaction across online and social media platforms. Following the launch of the WhatsApp Business Solution, GTBank is leveraging the platform to bring financial services closer to customers, whilst offering them more channels to bank, make enquiries and have their service requests treated promptly.
