Former Big Brother Naija housemate, Cee-C, has alleged she is being threatened with an acid attack. Cee-C, whose real name is Cynthia Nwadiora, shared the threat on Instagram which she captioned ‘Is this ever going to stop.’ A bromide of the threat was captured in an email dated August 6, 2018 and supposedly written by Greg Conway. in the email, she was threatened with an acid attack because her fans trolled Alex and Tobi. The message read: “Since you won’t tell your fellow bitter fans to stop trolling Alex and Tobi. I will teach u a lesson u will never forget in your miserable life. You are a bitter short witch. Tobi has moved on from u. U should do same. It’s not by force. U pay people to troll them every day. I know where u live and I will f..k you up. Be prepared. Anywhere I see u, I’m going to pour acid on Ur face. As a scar u will never forget in ur life. I won’t kill u but I wil bath ur face with acid.” However, other than posting the threat on social media, it is not known whether the runner-up of the reality TV competition had reported the matter to security officials. But, quickly coming to her defence, fellow former housemate Leo reacted to the threat of acid attack on Cee-C. “You’re threatening child of grace in Lagos where one of her allies is a true Lagosian,” he wrote on Twitter. He went on further to say: “We need to start taking mental health very seriously in this country.” Rumours that Cee-C and Leo are dating have been circulating.
