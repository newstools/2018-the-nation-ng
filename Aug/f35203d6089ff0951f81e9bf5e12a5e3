A youth group under the aegis of Ikale Development Initiative (IDI) on Wednesday dissociated itself from the protest over power outage NY a coalition of youths from Ondo South senatorial district over power outage. In a statement jointly signed by the President and Secretary of the group, Messrs Afolabi Ebilala and Denis Adeoye respectively, the group described the protest as politically motivated thereby disassociating itself from such sabotage. According to the statement, the brains behind the planned protest are individuals exploiting the plight of the people of the district to attack the state government in advancement of their parochial political interests. It reads “We, members of Ikale Development Initiative (IDI) hereby dissociate ourselves from this infantile and politically sponsored protest. We are particularly appalled that certain individuals could turn the plights of our people to a political weapon against the state government.” IDI described the timing of the planned protest as wrong and unwarranted most especially when the state government last week approved commencement of power intervention initiative through establishment of mini power grid in some communities in the Ondo South Senatorial District. The group reasoned that protests were not initiated by these individuals when the state government had not announced the approval of its power intervention initiative, thereby describing the move by the politicians as dead on arrival. “Without making noise and with all sense of measured decorum, our group, which comprises of Ikale youths from different parts of Nigeria, has lobbied the Niger Delta Power Holding Company, Transmission Company of Nigeria and we have engaged the Ondo State government through the Office of Public Utilities where we received assurances that the Governor Rotimi Akeredolu-led administration is working on initiative to power some of our cri “We have carried out investigation and we now know two politicians who are using these individuals to portray the Ikales and the rest of the people of Ondo South as ungrateful impressionable beings.” While appreciating the state government for the intervention, IDI urged the contractors to move to site immediately.
