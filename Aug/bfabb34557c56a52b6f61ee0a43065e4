The Senator representing Bayelsa East in the National Assembly, Ben Murray-Bruce, has said that ballot brought him into office and not bullet. An unusual security blanket was thrown around the National Assembly Complex in Abuja on Tuesday by men of the Department of State Security (DSS). The National Assembly staff, legislative aides and journalists who arrived the complex, met stern-faced operatives of the DSS who disallowed entry into the premises. Reacting to this, Ben Bruce through his Titter page wrote: “I am here at the National Assembly. I will not run away. If they like they can shoot me. Bullets did not bring me into office. Ballots brought me into office. I am here. Let them do their worst!” I am here at the National Assembly. I will not run away. If they like they can shoot me. Bullets did not bring me into office. Ballots brought me into office. I am here. Let them do their worst! pic.twitter.com/zwEW76UQNR — Ben Murray-Bruce (@benmurraybruce) August 7, 2018
