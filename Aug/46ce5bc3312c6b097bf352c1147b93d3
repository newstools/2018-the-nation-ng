Super Eagles forward Alex Iwobi and his Arsenal teammates will open their Europa league campaign against Portugal side Sporting CP following the draw which was dished out on Friday. The Nigerian international who has been in great shape for the Emirates landlords will be looking forward to help the side compete for title after missing a place in the Champions league finishing in the 6th place last season with 70 points. Compatriot Victor Moses who recently announced a decision to retire from the national team and concentrate on club assignment will be facing Greek side PAOK with his Chelsea teammates. The 27 year old who reportedly is being approached by the Super Eagles coaching crew to have  a rethink into what has been dubbed his ‘shocking and early retirement from international football’,was left out in the Blues 2-1 away victory over Newcastle last week prompting some of his mischievous critics to predict that it will be hard for him to get the required playing time under new coach Maurizio Sarri. He was equally an unused substitute earlier when Chelsea hosted Arsenal in a tie that ended 3-2 in favour of Chelsea with Iwobi enjoying 75 minutes action garnished with a 41st minute goal to his credit.
