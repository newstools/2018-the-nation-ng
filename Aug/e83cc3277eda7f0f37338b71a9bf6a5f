Twenty eight ministers on Wednesday attended the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting presided by Acting President Yemi Osinbajo. The ministers were those present in the Council Chamber when Osinbajo called for rendition of the National anthem by 11a.m. The Minister of State for Education, Prof. Anthony Anwukah said the Christian opening prayer, while the Minister of Water Resources, Suleiman Adamu offered the Muslim prayer. The turn out on Wednesday was unprecedented compared to the past FEC meetings chaired by Osinbajo at Vice President or Acting President. Osinbajo had last week Tuesday terminated the appointment of the immediate past Director-General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Daura. On Tuesday, Osinbajo also ordered immediate overhaul of Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS).
