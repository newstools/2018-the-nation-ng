Operators of the new aircraft hangar in Lagos and Abuja, 7 Star Global Hangar, yesterday clarified that it was granted license by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) as an Approved Maintenance Organisation (AMO) to carry out aircraft line maintenance. Its Chief Executive Officer, Isaac Balami said the clarification became necessary against the background of media reports that the firm got approval for major aircraft repairs including C- checks. He said the firm could only upgrade its level of checks on aircraft after inspection and approval by the NCAA, following improvements in its services. “Our approval from NCAA only covers line maintenance of aircraft. We have not advanced to the C- check stage yet. As we progress in the business and subject to the approval of the authority we shall undertake other levels of check,” he said.
