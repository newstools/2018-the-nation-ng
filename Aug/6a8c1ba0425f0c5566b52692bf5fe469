House of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara said on Friday that he had nothing to do with the political ambition of one of his aides, who had declared his intention to seek a ticket to the Bauchi Sate House of Assembly on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Iliya Habila, a media aide to Dogara, wants to represent Bogoro Constituency, same as Dogara. Habila’s declaration earlier in the week was thought in some quarters to have received the blessing of the Speaker. However Dogara’s Special Adviser on Media and Public Affairs, Turaki Hassan,said on Friday that the Speaker had no input in or influenced the political aspiration of Habila. He said: “contrary to reports published by some national dailies, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara, Speaker of the House of Representatives, did not endorse any aspirant to vie for Bogoro Constituency in Bauchi State House of Assembly or any other. “His constituents and political associates know that he does not interfere and will not endorse anybody, and neither will he ask anyone to seek election under the platform of any political party; whether the All Progressives Congress or the Peoples Democratic Party.” Dogara though a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) ,has not been attending party functions for some time now. He is a close ally of Senate President Bukola Saraki who recently defected from the APC to the PDP . He announced on Thursday that he will be seeking the party’s presidential ticket for next year’s election.
