The Director-General of DMO, Ms. Patience Oniha,  said as at June 30, the nation’s public debt stock increased marginally by 3.01 per cent from that of December, 2017. “One of the beneficial outcomes is the rebalancing of the debt stock, the ratio of domestic debt to external debt inching towards the target of 60:40 and the target of 75:25 between long term domestic debt and short term domestic debt. According to the figures for June 30 released by the DMO, the ratio between domestic and external debt stood at 70 to 30 compared to 73 to 27 in December, 2017. Ms.Oniha said the ratio of 60 to 40 was important to ensure that the nation was not 100 per cent indebted externally, and that it was also easier to raise money domestically. She said the Federal Government has been borrowing from the external debt market to refinance maturing local debts because of the lower interest rates obtainable from foreign sources
