Speaking to DAZN about his targets at Juventus, Cristiano Ronaldo said: “I want to win the Champions League with Juve – we will focus on that but without obsession, step after step, and then we’ll see: whether this year, next year or the year after.” He then added that “The goal for the club is to win the championship, the Italian Cup and of course do our best in the Champions League.” Ronaldo made his debut for Juventus in the 3-2 away victory at Chievo Verona but failed to find the net, most notably injuring Chievo’s experienced goalkeeper Stefano Sorrentino. Next up for Juventus and Ronaldo is a home game against Lazio on Saturday evening.
