Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike yesterday declared Governor Aminu Tambuwal’s defection as “victory for democracy”. In a statement, he said: “This is a victory for democracy.  There are lots of Nigerians who believe that the right thing should be done.  What the Sokoto State governor has done is the right thing. “There are some people who have said that we cannot continue to live in a world of intimidation.  We cannot continue to live in a world of harassment.  Every right thinking Nigerian should come together to see that something is done to salvage the country. “Democracy is under threat in Nigeria. Nobody obeys court judgments.  Nobody obeys the rule of law. If you say anything they come after you. That is no democracy. Democracy means allowing people to have different opinions.”
