The Oyo State Government on Sunday demolished Music House, the  structure owned by popular musician, Yinka Ayefele, and which houses his Fresh FM Station. The state government had  marked the structure located on the  Challenge-Toll Gate road for demolition for allegedly contravening the state ’s planning laws. But Ayefele had approached an Oyo State High Court sitting in Ibadan seeking to stop the planned demolition. Ayefele’s counsel, Mr Olayinka Bolanle, in an exparte motion, filed before the court, sought for an order of the court restraining the state government from demolishing the property pending the determination of the suit. Bolanle also stated that due process was followed in the construction of the structure while relevant approvals were obtained from the state’s departments and agencies associated with land and housing. Justice I. Yerima ordered the claimant to ensure service of the court process on the respondent and adjourned the case till Monday for the hearing of the exparte motion. However, the state government on Sunday demolished the structure. Witnesses told NAN  that bulldozers moved in at about 4.30 a.m. to commence the demolition  while Fresh FM alerted the public on the development. The government officials and equipment used in the exercise had since left the scene. NAN reports that the radio station had  since been off air while a huge crowd gathered at the scene of the  demolition as at the time of this report.(NAN)
