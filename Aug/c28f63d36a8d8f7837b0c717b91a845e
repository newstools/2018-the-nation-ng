POPULAR blogger and media personality, Tosin Ajibade, popularly known as OloriSupergal has said she is content to face the world on her own terms. “The focus has just been me basically,” the blogger who recently published and launched her book, ‘From Social Misfit To Social Media’ said to The Nation. “Everybody wants something different. I want to be different from the rest of the world.” On the success of her career on social media, she said she didn’t envisage it. “I’m really grateful that everything has turned out well,” she said. “A lot of things that I did not see or know have actually validated the things I’ve been doing for years. Social media is something that everybody is doing right now.” Sharing how social media has affected her life, OloriSupergal said: “For me, I’m really an introvert. But I try as much as possible to socialise with people; even people that I’ve not even met before because my work takes me out a lot. I get ready to face the world the way it comes to me. “It’s a little bit weird that people who are closer to you are the ones far away from you and the ones that you can’t even see, touch are the ones you’re closer to. So, it depends on how people work on their relationship.” She also said her online personae affects the way people relate with her. “They see Olori Supergal as a blogger,” she said. “They don’t want to associate themselves or they don’t want to talk when I’m around because they feel that anything that is said to me will be published online. So, I get a lot of that when I go out. Some of them change the topic when I’m around them but I just move on as if nothing happened.”
