Super Eagles’ captain, Mikel John Obi was again missing for the fourth consecutive Chinese Super League match as Tianjin Teda recovered from a goal down to beat Hebei China Fortune 2-1 away from home, AOIFootball.com reports. The Tianjin midfielder has been suffering from a knee injury which has kept him out for two weeks but was, however, hopeful of featuring against Hebei. His absence will now send worrying signals to Gernot Rohr ahead of next month’s qualifier against Seychelles. Goals from Frank Acheampong and Xie Weijun cancelled out Ayoub El Kaabi’s opener as Teda boosted their chances of a top half finish, moving up the table to 8th, with 21 points after 16 games. Mikel has been a super regular for the Chinese side but will hope to return in the coming weeks as Teda hopes to build on their impressive form of late which has seen them win two of their last three fixtures.
