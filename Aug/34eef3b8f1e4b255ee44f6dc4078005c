A former Edo State Youth Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Edo State, Comrade Osakpamwan Eriyo, has said that he will not defect to the Peoples Democratic Party. Eriyo, the former Chairman of the Road Transport Employers Association (RTEAN), said he disliked jumping from one political party to another. Eriyo said the PDP is dead across the country. He told reporters in Benin city, the state capital, that the APC is the toast of Nigerians for 2019. Eriyo said those defecting to he PDP were ones who cripped the economy. He said: “Is PDP a party? The PDP is not a party. The party that everybody recognise and everybody is clamouring to vote for is the APC. That is where I still remain. “The PDP should check my history if I am a person that move from party to party. I believe in APC. We are at the Bénin Airport to receive our national chairman, Adams Oshiomhole. Eriyo added: “We have more than 5000 persons waiting for Oshiomhole. There is a reason we believe in APC, it is because of Oshiomhole. Those waiting for me to defect to the PDP or other parties are wasting their time. Why should I leave a great a party like the APC to the PDP? “I will rather quit politics than for me join the PDP. We have believe in the APC. The defection you are seeing is because those leaving the APC do not have the people at heart. “Those leaving the APC has caused damage to our country. They are only going back to their former party.”
