Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar said yesterday he is not defecting to the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). There were speculations at the weekend that the former vice president would leave the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in his bid for a presidential ticket. Atiku returned to the PDP from the All Progressives Congress (APC) this year. Atiku left the PDP in 2007 to contest for President on the ticket of the Action Congress (AC) He contested and lost the bid for the APC ticket in 2014 having been defeated by President Muhammadu Buhari. A statement by his Media office yesterday described the report as a malicious attempt to confuse the public aboutAtiku’s aspiration. The statement said: “For the avoidance of  doubts, Atiku remains the frontline aspirant for the presidential ticket of the PDP. “In the past two months, Atiku Abubakar has moved across states in the country consulting with stakeholders of the PDP and explaining his agenda encapsulated in the acronym JOBS (Jobs, Opportunity, Being united and Security) for Nigeria. “The nationwide consultations continue this week with visits to the South West, North West and North Central zones of the country. “Atiku’s passion and commitment to winning the PDP primaries is without any compromise and to assume that he will abandon the hard work he has done with the positive results he is getting from the stakeholders of the party is to say the least preposterous and unthinkable”. The campaign office urged Atiku’s supporters across the country to remain steadfast and see the contrived news of defection as an attempt to distract him from the set task of winning the PDP ticket and the 2019 presidential election.
