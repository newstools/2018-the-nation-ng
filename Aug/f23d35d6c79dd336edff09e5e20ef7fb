The National Identity Management Commission (NIMC), in collaboration with Sokoto State government, has planned to set up a committee to enlighten indigenes on need to enrol into the National Identity Database (NIDB). This was disclosed in a statement issued by Mr Loveday Ogbonna, Head, Corporate Communications, NIMC on Friday in Abuja. Ogbonna said that the Sokoto state Deputy Governor, Ahmad Aliyu, during the presentation of his National Electronic Identity Card expressed concern over the low enrolment figures of National Identification Number (NIN) in the state. He expressed the state government’s readiness to ensure that adequate enlightenment was carried out especially at the grassroots level on the need for every citizen to obtain his or her NIN. “The issuance of the NIN is a nationwide programme; the importance of the NIN to national planning and development cannot be over emphasized . “Hence, the people in Sokoto state will not be left out in the exercise,” he stated. Aliyu further appealed to the citizens to participate fully in the exercise and support government’s policies and programmes at all times, adding that the state government would contribute its quota toward the success of NIMC project. In his remarks, Mr Garba Balarabe, Sokoto state Coordinator, NIMC, appreciated the state government for its support toward ensuring the fulfilment of NIMC’s mandate. Balarabe expressed readiness to work alongside the committee in ensuring that the people were sensitised on NIN. The coordinator further said that more registration centres would be opened in the state to further take the exercise closer to the masses. He also said that children were not exempted from the NIN enrolment exercise. (NAN)
