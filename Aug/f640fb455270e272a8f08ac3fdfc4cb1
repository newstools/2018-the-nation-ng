A partnership of groups of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sokoto State has insisted that defecting Governor Aminu Tambuwal should account for the bailout funds received from the federal government. The group recounted that the governor received various sums of money to ameliorate the problems in the state. “On behalf of APC support groups, we demanded Governor Tambuwal to account for N18.3 billion Paris Club refund, N38.7 billion bailout funds, N10.5 billion salary/pension arrears, N8.7 billion CBN/FGN agric interventions fund and N2.2 billion ecological funds from federal government’’. The Elders Committee of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Sokoto state which disowned Governor Aminu Tambuwal’s defection to opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said the governor should account for the money. Also recounting the assistance the state has received from President Muhammadu Buhari, the elders committee noted that the administration constructed Runjin Sambo-University road in Sokoto metropolis. “Buhari’s government executed Maradi junction border road, Sokoto-Tambuwal-Jega road, Shagari Dam project, establishment of 8 Divisions of Nigerian Army and ecological project among others,’’ the Chairman of the Committee, Sen. Bello Gada, said. Gada explained that all groups have joint partnerships for the success of President Buhari and APC in 2019 elections. Prof. Lawal Bashar, from APC Adalci Buhari Sak Organization, also alleged that Tambuwal had crippled local government administrations in Sokoto state as they were not doing anything during his tenure and workers salary were not being paid at when due. Bashar described the administration as the worst in the history of the state and stressed that the present administrations in the nearby states of Katsina, Kebbi and Zamfara states were far better. He added that governor’s exit from APC had become a relief and noted that APC would surely win all elective positions in 2019 elections.
