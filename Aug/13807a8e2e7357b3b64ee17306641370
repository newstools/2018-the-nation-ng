Operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) on Tuesday morning took over the entry of the National Assembly in Abuja. They blocked the entrance gates to the complex and prevented Senators Rafiu Ibrahim, Ben Murray Bruce and staff from entering the complex. The Clerk of the National Assembly, Alhaji Mohammed Sanni Omolori  was also refused entry at the second gate of the complex. Some of the masked operatives reportedly claimed to be acting on orders. Senator Rufai Ibrahim in a tweet said “I was just barred by fully armed, masked officers of the DSS from entering the National Assembly (@nassnigeria). “We’re acting on the order from above,” I was told by officers laying siege on the Assembly. All entrances BLOCKED.”
