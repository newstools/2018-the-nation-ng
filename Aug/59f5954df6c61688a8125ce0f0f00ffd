… Says he remains full – fledge PDP member   Senator Buruji Kashamu on Thursday insisted that he remained a full – fledge member of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), saying his alleged expulsion by the Party’s National Leadership cannot stand. Kashamu, representing, Ogun East Senatorial District at the Senate  was expelled two weeks ago for alleged anti-party activities but addressing thousands of party supporters at a mega rally in Abeokuta, Ogun State Capital, he assured his cheering supporters a subsisting court order robustly protects his membership of PDP. The mega rally was organised at the State Secretariat of the party on IBB Boulevard, Oke – Mosan, Abeokuta, as unity gathering where aspirants for various positions in the 2019 elections and placards bearing supporters besieged the venue. Kashamu who is a major fianacier of the party since 2011, wondered how a committed member could be expelled, dismissing his alleged expulsion as a ruse and illegality that would not stand. “How can somebody expel you when you are committed to the party, the party is not for an individual. “I want to state authoritatively that I, Senator Buruji Kashamu remain PDP member up till today. Any attempt to expel me will be an effort in futility because, I have an order that protects me from being expelled by anybody,” he said. According to him, his battle with the “National leadership of the party is to liberate the masses from the oppressed.” Also, the state factional Chairman, Bayo Dayo, who was also expelled by the Party Leadership said a Lagos High Court has recognised his executive as the authentic one and needed not be bothered by action that were in contempt of the court order. To him, the Party’s leadership acted illegally hence their decision is null and void. Adding that INEC has recognized us as the authentic PDP in Ogun State and we are dealing directly with INEC.
