The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has set a five-year timeline for banks to keep physical cheque presented to them by customers after which the instrument may be disposed. This is contained in the Nigerian Bankers’ Clearing System (NBCS) Rules released yesterday by the apex bank. The policy is in line with the CBN’s exercise  of  the  powers  conferred  on  it under Sections  2(d),  33  (1)(b)  and  47(2)  of  the  CBN  Act  2007  — to  promote a sound  financial system,  issue  guidelines,  facilitate  the  development  of  an  efficient  and effective  payments  system.

A  member  bank  may  be  penalised  by  suspension  from  participating  in  clearing for such periods as shall be determined by the CBN for non-attendance of two consecutive meetings of the Committee, without a satisfactory reason communicated in writing within five working days before or after any scheduled meeting. Eligible financial instruments for clearing purposes are paper-based payment instruments, such as cheques, managers  cheques, drafts , dividend/interest warrants, debit/credit notes, bankers  payments.
