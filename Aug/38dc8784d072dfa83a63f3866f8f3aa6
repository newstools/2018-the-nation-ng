The deputy national youth leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Afeez Bolaji Repete, has described the candidate of the party for the September 22nd Osun governorship election, Mr. Gboyega Oyetola, as the “best man to succeed Governor Rauf Aregbesola. Repete, who spoke while handing over his team’s campaign materials, including posters and educational booklets in support of IleriOluwa Campaign Organisation in Osogbo, the state capital, said Osun State deserved the best to carry on from where the incumbent governor will stop his “visionary tenure.” He said the Aregbesola administration, no doubt, has performed excellently in all sectors of the economy in the last eight years. He said Oyetola as a major contributor to the administration would not let down the people of the state if elected into office as governor. In a statement by the Media Officer of IleriOluwa Campaign Organisation, Dayo Fasola, the youth leader was quoted to have said that “governance is no longer business as usual. Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola’s administration has shown that so much can be acquired with so little and within the span of eight years. So we are here to contribute our own quota in our own little way.” Also, aspirant of the APC for the House of Representatives, representing Olorunda/Osogbo/Irepodun/Orolu federal constituency, Engr. Sola Oladepo; aspirant for House of Representatives in Ife federal constituency, Prince Sikiru Ayedun, and their counterpart to represent Obokun/Oriade federal constituency, Arch. Babatunde Desmond Ojo, expressed satisfaction with the performance of the Aregbesola administration. Responding, Oyetola expressed joy for the gestures and promised to live up to the expectations of the people of the state. He said: “I am always humbled by the people’s display of support for my aspiration. From God and your support, I have drawn a great strength to move on.”
