Senator Godswill Akpabio has said that he will support President Muhammadu Buharin to generate jobs and eradicate poverty. Acknowleging the anti-corruption drive of the President, Akpabio said he would join in fighting its “twin-brother which is poverty.” “I am joining the APC to stabilize the government and to assist the government to create employment opportunities for Nigerians so that we can fight the twin brother to corruption, which is poverty. “Poverty creates corruption and corruption deepens poverty, so we need to fight the two together. And that is one of the things I find attractive with the APC and believe me, with my people in Akwa Ibom State, with my presence in the APC, my people in South South have now seen the light and they say APC is the party to vote for come 2019.” he added. He told reporters after the National Caucus meeting at the Villa that “The meeting went very well and a lot of topical issues were discussed bothering on the interest of the nation. The resolutions are fantastic and I believe that the resolutions will not only move the party forward but will help to alleviate the situation in the country today and Nigerians will be happy for it.” Akpabio praised President Buhari’s leadership, saying “the President has kept his integrity intact.” He added: “He has been able to improve the image of Nigeria and restored a lot of respect for Nigeria before the international community. “I can assure you that he alone can attract millions of people, he is that infectious.”
