Rashidat Ajibade  scored in the  last-minute goal to seal a place in the quarter-finals for Nigeria, as the Falconets forced China to a 1-1 draw in the on-going FIFA U-20 Women’s World Cup.’ The Nigerians needed a draw to advance, with China needing a victory to advance. Peter Bonde’s Chinese ladies drew first blood as Linyan Zhang broke the deadlock in the 41st minute, beating goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie. In the second half, China threatened as they created several scoring chances, while poor marksmanship was the Falconets’ major undoing. The Asians looked well set to cruise into the quarter-final before captain Ajibade found a way to send her side through with barely the last kick of the encounter. Ajibade converted a cross at the 95th minute to set up a quarter-final fixture against Spain, in Concarneau on Thursday 16th August.
