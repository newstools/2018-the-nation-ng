Ten members of the dissolved Ishola Balogun – Fulani led executives of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara state, Thursday have resigned their appointments. The dissolved executive members  have been laying claim to their positions. The National Working Committee of the APC had dissolved the state executives led by Ishola Balogun-Fulani shortly after the gale of defection of APC members to PDP in the state. The NWC thereafter set up a caretaker committee headed by Hon Bashir Bolarinwa. However, a Kwara state High Court ruled that the Ishola Balogun-Fulani led executive is the one recognised by law. Leading the pack of those who resigned are the former state women leader, Ramat Oganija and the state the publicity secretary, Buhari Sulyman who resigned. Other APC officers that have resigned their appointments include Mohammed Halliru (Asst. Welfare Secretary) ,Isiaka oniwa (North senatorial chairman), Jimoh Adesina (Central Senatorial Chairman), Katum mohammed (Organizing Secretary), Ramat Ibrahim (Financial Secretary),Jinatu ibrahim (North Women Leader),Atiku Abdurahman (North Senatorial Chairman) and  Sunkanmi Ereoye (South Senatorial Youth Leader). In his letter of resignation, Alhaji Buhari said his resignation was occasioned by the national leadership of APC who he accused of causing crises in the state chapter. He added that there was also lack of reward system in the party” we toiled to build from the scratch.” The letter reads: I wish to notify you of my resignation from the position of the publicity secretary of the APC in Kwara state. I have also resigned my membership of the party with immediate effect. “My resignation is based on litany of issues, chief among the issues is that the national leadership of the APC, through its actions, has continued to directly fuel crises in the state chapter of the party at the detriment of those of us who toiled day and night for years to ensure the ultimate victory of the APC at the polls.”
