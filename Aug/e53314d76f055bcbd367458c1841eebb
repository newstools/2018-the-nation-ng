The Federal Government has flagged off the rehabilitation of the 122 kilometre Mayo Belwa-Jada-Ganye-Toungo road in Adamawa which will cost N22.7 billion. Mr Babatunde Fashola, (SAN) the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, disclosed this in a statement by Mr Theodore Ogaziechi, the Director of Information in the ministry. Fashola, represented by Alhaji Mustapha Shehuri, the Minister of State 1 in the ministry at the occasion marking the commencement of the project, said the road was due for rehabilitation. He said that the road, constructed in 1999, was currently in very deplorable state with several failed sections, potholes, alligator cracks, depressions and washouts at the edges. The minister added that the road was also an important economic route linking major farming communities of Mararaba, Jamtari, Jada, Dashen, Ganye, Toungo and neighbouring Taraba. He said that the project, expected to be completed in 36 months, would involve the reconstruction of the 112 kilometre road with 7.3 metre carriageway width and 2.75 metre shoulders. According to him, the carriageway will be overlaid with 60mm asphalt concrete binder course, 40mm asphalt concrete wearing course with pavement of 200mm thick and 200mm stone base. The Governor of Adamawa, Bindow Jubrilla, commended the federal government for the project, adding that it would no doubt, increase investment in rice production and livestock farming in the state.
