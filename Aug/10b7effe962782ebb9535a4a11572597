An Ikeja High Court yesterday dismissed the murder charge preferred against Lagos State People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Chairman Mr Moshood Salvador and 10 others. Justice Obafemi Adamson freed the defendants following the advice of the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), exonerating them of the killing of Apapa Local Government Area PDP Chairman Adeniyi Aborishade on July 21. The others are: Kehinde Fasasi, Rotimi Kujore, Fatai Adele, Ismaila Abiola, Amos Fawole, Victoria Falowo, Mukaila Odukoya, Oropo Isaac, Mohammed Babangida and Ugochukwu Nwoke. They were docked before Chief Magistrate Oyetade Komolafe of the Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court on July 25 for alleged conspiracy and unlawful killing. Mr Komolafe remanded them in Kirikiri Prison following their not guilty plea and adjourned till August 27 for the DPP’s advice. But Salvador, through his counsel Mr Lawal Pedro (SAN), challenged his remand and sought a dismission of the charge, among others, at the high court. When the matter, came up before Justice Adamson yesterday, an Assistant Director of Public Prosecution, Mr Olaitan Soetan, said there was a “development” regarding Salvador’s prayers. The judge’s attention was drawn to the DPP’s report to the lower court recommending the defendants’ discharge for want of evidence. The report, endorsed by Lagos State Attorney-General, Mr Adeniji Kazeem, advised the police to release the suspects and intensify the hunt for the actual killers. It, however, advised the police to charge Kehinde Fasasi with disorderly conduct contrary to Section 168(d) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State for causing the fracas that led to the incident Pedro affirmed the new state of affairs and told the court that “the matter has been overtaken by circumstances.” He urged the court to dismiss the charge. Ruling, Justice Adamson freed the defendants based on the DPP’s advice.
