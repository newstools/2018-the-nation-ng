Some residents of Lagos State yesterday said they have come to terms with the dirty and multilated naira notes in circulation, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. They told NAN that clean naira notes were hard to come by nowadays. Miss Ekene Okugba said she had not seen new naira notes in over two years. “I’m used to seeing and receiving dirty notes, so I have got used to it. I can’t remember the last time I received clean naira notes from anywhere. “Even Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) dispense dirty notes, so we have all got used to it not because we like it, but because we don’t have a choice. A trader, Miss Damilola Ajayi, said she was used to accepting mutilated notes from customers. “Most customers always come with dirty notes but what can I do than to accept it from them. I can’t drive them away because of some dirty notes. “Even when you go to the bank to get money, you will be given dirty notes. I can’t remember the last time I saw neat notes; that is really a scarce commodity. “The most important thing is that it can be accepted whenever l spend it, so I’m fine with it,” she said. Mr Timi Alawode, a public servant, urged the authorities to address the situation which, he described as worrisome. “People in this country always settle for less and that’s why we can tolerate some certain kind of things which should not be. “The Central Bank of Nigeria should address the situation by sanctioning erring banks that give out dirty notes to the public.
