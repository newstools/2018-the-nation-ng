Super Eagles’ defender, Kenneth Omeruo will spend the 2018/19 season on loan at Leganes in the Spanish top flight after becoming the latest Blues’ player to be loaned out of the club ahead of the new campaign, AOIFootball.com reports. Omeruo, who completed his loan switch to Spain on Wednesday morning has been handed the number 24 jersey ahead of his unveiling to the fans at ID Butarque on  Friday, a club statement confirmed. The 24-year-old central defender, who could also play at right-back, moved to Stamford Bridge from Standard Liege in 2012 but has failed to establish himself with the London club, joining the likes of Ado Den Haag, Middlesbrough, and Alanyaspor on loan in the past. Omeruo spent last season on loan at Turkish side Kasimpasa, where he made 28 appearances and was named in the Nigeria squad for this summer’s World Cup.
