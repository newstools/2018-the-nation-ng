Super Eaglesâ€™ World Cup 2018 squad member Joel Obi is edging closer to a move to Spanish La Liga side Celta Vigo as talks have progressed nicely in the past few days, Owngoalnigeria.com understands. Obi is deemed surplus to requirements at Torino by new coach Walter Mazzari despite playing 22 league games last season and also finding the back of the net five times from his deep-lying midfield role. Fellow Serie A side Parma stepped up its pursuit of the 27-year-old but Celta which has long signified its intention to add the Nigerian to their squad, held a productive meeting with Torino over his transfer. Celta Vigo intensified its push to sign the former Inter-Milan midfielder as it warms up for the potential exit of their Slovakian midfielder Stanislav Lobotka, who is close to agreeing on a move to Napoli. On his part, Joel Obi is keen on a new adventure in a different environment after spending the entirety of his career so far in Italy, where he has turned out for Inter-Milan, Parma, and Torino, where he has been the past three seasons.
