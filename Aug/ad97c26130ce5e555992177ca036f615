Super Eagles captain John Mikel Obi has pulled out of the September 7 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers between Seychelles and Nigeria in Victoria. NationSport scooped that Mikel called up the team’s manager Gernot Rohr to excuse himself from the crucial game, citing the fact that he had not fully regained the required fitness level needed to play the game. Mikel also informed the President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick, to disclose his reasons for opting out of the Seychelles game. Mikel joins the long list of injury-hit players such as Tyronne Ebuehi and Shehu Abdullahi, both of who play at the right back of the Eagles’ defence line, especially at the 2018 World Cup held in Russia, where Nigeria was eliminated in the group stage. Former captain of the Nigeria U-17 and U-20 team Musa Muhammed has been invited to replace Ebuehi and Abdullahi. Abdullahi now plays for Croatian side HNK Gorica. Asked if Victor Moses will be listed among those to make the trip to Victoria against Seychelles on September 7, NationSport’s usually dependable source revealed that the body and the manager have agreed to respect Moses’ decision, but he didn’t rule out moves to sit with the Chelsea star to evaluate why he chose to quit international football at such a young age of 27.
