The Enugu State Police Command has arrested a three-man Automated Teller Machine (ATM) fraud syndicate operating in the state. In a statement on Friday, the Command’s spokesman, Ebere Amaraizu, said police operatives recovered 30 ATM cards belonging to different individuals from the syndicate. He said the syndicate was smashed by the Command’s Anti Cultism Squad who acted on a well-coordinated intelligence information. He said the syndicate specialised in swindling their victims of hard-earned money through ATM cards’ transactions. According to him, they do this smartly under the guise of offering assistance to customers, but exchange their non-workable ATM cards with the customers’ version. “They will pick the real ATM cards and also spy on the pin code of the customers’ cards. “They use this trick to wreak havoc on the affected victims and withdrew the customers’ deposits in few hours,’’ he said. The suspects are – Chinweuba Ogodo, a tricycle operator in the city, Okechukwu Nwoke, a bus driver and Sopuruchi Emmanuel. NAN
