A tyre expert, Rajendra Vishwakarma, has cautioned motorists against over-inflating or under-inflating their tyres, saying it hampers smooth driving and compromises safety. Viswakarma, who works with Infinity Tyres Limited, said this at a  workshop organised by the Nigeria Auto Journalists Association (NAJA) at Golden Tulip Hotel, Lagos. According to him, an over-inflated tyre loses grip of the road from the sides of the tyre, while an under-inflated tyre loses grip of the road from the middle. He listed the effect of incorrect pressure to include premature failure of tyre, uneven wear, vehicle stand-still on roads, hard steering, more fuel consumption, less grip of the tyres on the road leading to increased braking distance, as well as financial losses. Viswakarma listed the important roles played by air in the tyre to include carrying of the load of the entire vehicle, ensuring wear pattern of the tyre and elongating the life of the tyre. He advised motorists to check inflation pressure of their tyres at regular intervals, saying: “It is advisable to check inflation pressure on every tyre every trip or 2000 kilometres due to adverse road conditions. “Motorists should allow tyre to cool down for at least 15-20 minutes before checking and inflating, ensure that pressure gauge used for checking are in good condition; check any possible leakage from valve or bead area, and close the valve with valve cap after inflating,” he added.
