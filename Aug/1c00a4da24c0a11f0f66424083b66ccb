Mother of a student of Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) allegedly assaulted by the school’s security men on July 11 for wearing earrings has threatened to go to court. Ms Folake Sokoya said she was injured when she went to enquire why her son, Boluwatife Olowu, was beaten up. She described as false LASPOTECH’s claim that she attacked its security men. In a statement, she said she had video and photographs to prove her case. Boluwatife is a National Diploma II student in the Hospitality Management Technology Department. The statement reads: “Reading through the purported press release, I find it misleading and false as the narrative of the Public Relations officer (PRO) does not depict the true account of what happened that day. “It may interest the general public to know that there are pictorial and video evidences on the true account of what transpired between both parties that fateful day. “The pictures of how I was battered with my son are enough evidence that their publication is false and misleading. My son and I were not in an accident but were battered mercilessly by LASPOTECH guards. I have resorted to seeking legal redress in quest for justice and my lawyer has been consulted and briefed on the matter.” In a petition, Sokoya said she lost some valuables to the attack. She said her son’s $300; stud earring, N70,000 earrings, a gold chain and pendant worth $800, a swatch wristwatch ($250) were lost. She claimed that her two Samsung J3 prime phones worth N40,000 each got damaged. The school denied the allegations in an earlier statement by its Deputy Registrar (Information and Public Relations) Olanrewaju Kuye. It described Ms Sokoya as the aggressor, alleging that she attacked its security men when she came to the school over the seizure of her son’s earrings.
