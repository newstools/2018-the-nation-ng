The All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of leaking its official correspondence to the public. The party asked the commission to look into its internal mechanism for handling sensitive mails. The party is not happy with the commission for leaking its letter notifying it of its proposed dates for party primaries in compliance with the provisions of the Electoral Act. A time table for the primaries was published in a national daily, forcing the party to issue a denial, but a letter signed by the National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole addressed to the INEC Chairman and received in August 17 by the commission surfaced in the media. Reacting to the development, Acting National Publicity Secretary of the APC, Yekini Nabena, said the National Executive Committee of the party need to approve the time table for it to become authentic. Nabena said: “Our attention has been drawn to a leaked letter the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole wrote to the Chairman, Independent National Electoral Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, informing the Commission of the schedule of the congresses and primaries to elect party candidates for the 2019 general elections. “These leaks of our sensitive and confidential correspondence to INEC is becoming commonplace and totally unacceptable,” Nabena said. “We strongly request that INEC looks into its internal handling of official correspondence and put a stop to these leaks. “While the leaked formal notification to INEC has been done by the APC pursuant to the provisions of Section 85 of the 2010 Electoral Act (as amended), we advise the general public, particularly the media, to wait for an official announcement from the party as the leaked dates are subject to changes, if necessary.”
