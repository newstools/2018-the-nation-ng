Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has expressed delight over the return of Governors Abdulfatah Ahmed of Kwara State and Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). While Ahmed defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP on Tuesday, Tambuwal announced his defection on Wednesday. The former Vice President congratulated the two governors, as well as the Deputy Governor of Kano State, Prof. Hafizu Abubakar and Nigeria’s Ambassador to South Africa, Alhaji Ahmed Ibeto, who also defected from the APC to the PDP about the same time. A statement issued on Wednesday by the Atiku media office said:  “When in December 2017, the Waziri Adamawa said the APC has to embrace the true tenets of democracy or lose its soul, he was greeted with hostility and his warnings were scorned. “At that time, Atiku Abubakar had warned that without justice, there could be no unity and without internal democracy there could be no internal cohesion.” The presidential aspirant urged true lovers of democracy to emancipate themselves from the faux democracy practiced in the APC and move over to the only party capable of entrenching genuine democracy in Nigeria and economic progress for Nigerians. He also called urged the Federal Government to respect the decisions of those now voting with their feet and ensure that they are not persecuted by security officials and law enforcement agencies.    The PDP chieftain urged the powers that be to note that the party set up these agencies to fight crime and criminality and not to fight democracy and democrats.
