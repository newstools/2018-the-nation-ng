Robert Lewandowski put the summer speculation over his future behind him with a hat-trick inside 55 minutes, before Kingsley Coman added a fourth shortly before the hour mark and Thiago Alcantara added a late fifth to wrap up the victory. The result sees new Bayern boss Niko Kovac get off to a winning start against his former club, who he masterminded to DFB-Pokal glory at the expense of Bayern last season. There were a number of flash points in a spiky affair despite the semi-competitive nature of the fixture, and the first of those saw Lewandowski clash with a defender before opening the scoring moments later. Joshua Kimmich provided the cross for the Poland international, who drew a blank at this summer’s World Cup but needed only 21 minutes to open his account for the domestic campaign by planting his header back across goal and into the bottom corner. Frankfurt almost produced an immediate response as they looked to emulate their surprise victory under Kovac in last season’s cup final, but Mijat Gacinovic fired narrowly wide from the edge of the box. Bayern soon gained complete control of the contest with a second goal in the space of five minutes, though, and once again it came via a Lewandowski header as he was left unmarked to the area to glance his effort past the keeper. Frankfurt avoided any further damage before half time, but Bayern were quickly back on the front foot after the interval and it took a fine fingertip save from Frederik Ronnow to turn Arjen Robben’s curling effort past the post in the opening stages of the second half. Another run-in between Lewandowski and a Frankfurt defender was then followed by the striker’s hat-trick goal, although he needed a stroke of luck to get past his marker despite a poor touch, before sweeping his finish past the keeper with aplomb.
