HIS Imperial Majesty, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, the Ooni of Ife on Wednesday played host to businessman and philanthropist, Dr. Tope Agbeyo, and Mr. F. John Bray, Consul General, United States Consulate General, Lagos, at a sumptuous breakfast meeting at his palace in Ile Ife, Osun State. The meeting which also had in attendance Rev. Mother Esther Ajayi, the General Overseer of the Love Of Christ Generational (C&S) Church, London, was used to discuss the development of the Ife Kingdom and the role of the United States in the coming September election in the state, among others. While the full details of the meeting were not released immediately, it was gathered that the monarch extended the invitation to Agbeyo, CEO of Cornfield Group, due to his growing influence in the areas of peace and strategic development across Africa. Agbeyo has continually been gaining recognition from various international and local governmental organisations who have been acknowledging his quiet contribution to the human capital development in Nigeria and other parts of the world.
