Four thousand and fifty pupils seeking places in JSS2 and SS1 classes in public junior and senior secondary schools in Lagos State took a transfer test on Monday across the six education districts. While 3,063 of them are seeking admission to SS1 classes, 987 pupils seek placement in JSS2 classes. The test examined the applicants’ academic capabilities for the class they applied for in the state owned schools. The Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Education, Mrs Adebunmi Adekanye monitored the screening at the Immaculate Hearts Comprehensive Senior Secondary School, Maryland. She expressed satisfaction with the exercise and promised that the result would be released in good time to enable the successful pupils resume at the beginning of the new academic session next month. Mrs Adekanye said improved performance of public school pupils in public examinations and competition as well as the government’s free education policy increased the attraction of the schools. Also Speaking, the Tutor General/Permanent Secretary, Education District II, Mr Abayomi Olusanya said 1,346 pupils sat for the examination in the district which has over 100 schools across three local governments of Ikorodu, Somolu and Kosofe. He said admission will be based on the student’s performance and the space available in schools for successful applicants. Parents at the various examination centres who spoke with the media team were thankful for the conduct of the examination.  They thanked the government for making the exercise transparent and providing level playing ground for interested pupils to compete for the available vacancies in public schools of their choice. Makinde Samuel, who had his junior secondary education at the Hossanah College, a private school, said he wants to undertake his senior secondary education in a public school because of better quality and  that parents could no longer afford the fees paid in the private school.
