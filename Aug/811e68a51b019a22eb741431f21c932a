Senate President Bukola Saraki has expressed optimism the impeachment threats against him will fail. He said he is not losing sleep over the threats, saying he would retain his seat as long as rule of law is followed. He also described insinuations that he defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because of his presidential ambition as “cheap blackmail”. Saraki, who was on a private visit to Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa yesterday in Asaba -the Delta State Capital, said he left from the All Progressives Congress (APC) because the ruling party had derailed from the “democratic visions and ideas” espoused on its formation. Saraki, who had on his entourage Senators Peter Nwaboshi and Dino Melaye among others, said he is not losing any sleep over the impeachment threats. According to him, when the National Assembly reconvenes and constitutional processes are followed, the impeachment threats will “fizzle out”. His words: “You can look at me. I am not losing any sleep about it.  We believe democracy must go by the rule of law. “There are processes, constitutional processes over what we do. So I am not concerned about that. There are lots of noise being made about that but be sure that once we resume the processes are followed we will see that the noise will fizzle out so I am not concerned about it.” He said his mission to Delta State was to share views with a colleague with whom he had a very cordial relationship at the National Assembly, describing Okowa as a very “important, capable and competent party man”. Saraki lauded the level of development witnessed in Delta State in the past three years, saying, “A lot of opportunities have been created for Deltans. There is a lot of development in the state and this is what we want to see in most of our states.”
