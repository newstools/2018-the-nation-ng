The Lagos State government said it has credited N466.85 million to the Retirement Savings Accounts (RSA) of 187 of its retirees under the Contributory Pension Scheme (CPS) for  last month. More retirees from the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) benefited from this batch. Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr. Akintola Benson Oke, said despite the paucity of funds, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode  ensured that he released funds monthly for their entitlements. He said 9,401 retirees had been paid about N38.5 billion. LASPEC Director-General, Mrs. Folasade Onanuga, said the government would continue to play the mother-hen role. She advised retirees on the importance of putting their houses in order in case of any eventuality by ensuring that they wrote their wills while they were alive. She also advised them to be active in retirement, because the more they moved around, the better for their health. Speaking on behalf of the others, two of the retirees, Mr. Orisayomi Olafemi and Mrs. C. B. Adewole commended Ambode  for accelerating the payment of their entitlements, which they said could not be compared with what obtained in other states.
