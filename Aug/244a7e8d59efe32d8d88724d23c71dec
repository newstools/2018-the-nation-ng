Former Super Eagles’ striker, Julius Efosa Aghahowa has backed media reports linking Eagles’ captain John Mikel Obi with a return to European football, calling it a welcome development for both the player and the national team, AOIFootball.com reports. The former Shakhtar Donetsk striker told AOIFootball.com in an exclusive interview, that Mikel might have seen it all in China and believes it’s the right time to move on. John Obi Mikel of Nigeria is challenged by Luka Modric of Croatia during the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia group D match between Croatia and Nigeria at Kaliningrad Stadium on June 16, 2018, in Kaliningrad, Russia. “Well, if the reports are true, then Mikel has said it all. He obviously feels the league is not what he wants anymore and wants to return to Europe and also get close to his family which is very important. “He could be getting the money in China but misses the competitive nature of European football, especially for a player of his stature, used to a very high level of competition during his time at Chelsea. I believe he’s a top professional and will take the right decision,” Aghahowa noted. The former Wigan striker further added that Mikel’s return to Europe could be a boost for the national team, considering the fact that he is the captain. “I think it will be good for us because he is the captain and will boost the image of the Super Eagles. I also believe if he returns to the competitive nature of European football could add more years to his playing career,” Aghahowa concluded.
