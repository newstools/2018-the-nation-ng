Mrs Buhari said the gesture was to empower women to be self-reliant. The Presidentâ€™s wife, who opened the Daura Office for grassroots women initiatives, also gave out groundnut-grinding machines. Mrs. Buhari explained that President Muhammadu Buhari is focused on the fight against graft, even if it involvs his relatives using their position to abuse public trust. While urging women to be ambassadors of peace, she called on stakeholders to be proactive in nation-building. Some of the beneficiaries thanked her for providing succour to them. Mrs. Fatima Idris said as a grassroots woman, she did not need millions to excel in her business. She promised to make judicious use of the money for the success of her business.
