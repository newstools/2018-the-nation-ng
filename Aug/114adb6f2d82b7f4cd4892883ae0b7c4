Some residents of Shogunle in Oshodi Local Government Area of Lagos State have decried the smoking of India hemp by some youths in the community. No fewer than five boys sat in a house beside a church at the entrance to Esuola Street smoking the India hemp early in the morning when The Nation visited the community. A community leader, Sunny Balogun, told The Nation that the boys have so many hideouts where they smoke. “In Shogunle, we have some dark spots where street urchins otherwise called area boys always hangout to smoke cannabis. After taking all the concoction into their systems, they begin to have ideas to commit one crime or the other, including getting involved in rape and stealing, among others. About a year ago, we had a case where one of their godfathers was shot dead in the street.” He said the smokers’ activities reflected badly on the community. He called on the federal and state government to come to their aid. “Government should implement community policing that will help checkmate the excesses of these bad eggs, weed them out and get them engaged in meaningful activities of earning their living rather than getting involved in criminal acts.” He urged youths to avoid anti-progressive acts, because they are leaders of tomorrow. The Community Development Association (CDA) Chairman, Alhaji Rasak Oyekanmi, said the boys action was affecting the health of many residents. “An old woman who went for test recently was told by the doctor that the test revealed that she smokes hemps or something of such,” he said. He urged the police to help dislodge the boys from the dark spots. “Though the police are doing their best to curb the situation. I believe the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) can assist the police to curb the menace,” he said.
