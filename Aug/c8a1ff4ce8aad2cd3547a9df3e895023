Members of the Private Depot of Oil & Gas Marketers Association of Nigeria (PDOGMAN) have passed a vote of confidence on President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring fuel availability, especially during the just celebrated Moslem festivities. Speaking in an interview with our correspondent over the weekend, the pioneer National President of the Association, Chief (Dr.) Kolawole Adewoyin said it was heartening to note that under the current administration the perennial fuel scarcity being experienced during festive period was no longer the norm. According to the PDOGMAN boss, this feat was achieved thanks to the commitment of the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu with the support for Mr. President. “We want to thank President Muhammadu Buhari for ensuring fuel availability, especially during the just celebrated Moslem festivities as well as creating the enabling environment for our organisation to thrive,” he said. While reiterating the Association’s commitment towards driving the oil and gas sector, the Group Managing Director/Chief Executive of AA Adewoyin Petroleum said: “Our sole objective is to market and distribute petroleum products and gas to the teeming populace of this country. As the name implies, Private Depot of Oil & Gas Marketers Association of Nigeria, we are entrusted with buying and selling/distribution of petroleum products from all private depots across Nigeria as we are working according to the norms of each depot.” The membership of the Association, he stressed, is opened to all station owners and dealers as long as they are duly registered with the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR). “We are not in contention with any organisation but our primary objectives amongst others, is to work towards alleviating the sufferings of our teaming members across the nation. It is on record that our members do face a lot of challenges before and after loading their products from any private depot.”
