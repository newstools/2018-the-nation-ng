The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) claimed yesterday that  the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Federal Government were  shopping for  an interim court order to unseat  Senate  President Bukola Saraki, following his defection to the PDP. The National Publicity Secretary of the opposition party, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged plan by  “cabals in the Presidency and APC” to file an action to challenge the validity of Saraki’s seat for the purpose of securing a fraudulent injunction to force him out of office pending the determination of the substantive suit. He said:“further intelligence available to us shows that once they are able to secure the injunction from a particular compromised judicial officer, they intend to arraign and detain the Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, on trumped up charges and ensure he is not granted bail so as to keep him out of circulation while their men would move in to effect an illegal leadership change in the Senate. Ologbondiyan said  the  alleged plot to destabilise Nigeria’s  democracy confirms  “our earlier stand that President Buhari’s supposed London vacation is a ploy to absolve himself of responsibility for the political terror they have plotted to unleash on the opposition, especially the National Assembly. “Although they denied it as usual, Nigerians can bear witness to the fact that there is nothing the APC government denied that they did not eventually execute. Indeed, there has never been any impunity they executed that they did not deny.”
