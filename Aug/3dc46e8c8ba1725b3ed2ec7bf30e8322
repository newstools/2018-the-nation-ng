Ahead of Saturday’s bye election for the Lokoja/Kogi Federal constituency, the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ), has assured of a smooth exercise. Addressing a stakeholders’ meeting on the conduct of the election, on Wednesday, in the state capital, the Kogi State Resident Electoral Commission (REC), Prof. James Apam disclosed that materials for the exercise are ready, adding that distribution (non sensitive materials) to the designated areas will commence on Thursday (today). Allaying the fears of many, the REC assured the people of a free and fair election conduct, just as he enjoined all to remain law abiding before, during and after the exercise. The state Commissioner of Police (CP), Mr. Ali Janga said that the command will be up to its duty in providing security for all and guarding against the breech of the law, throughout the period. Some of the stakeholders had expressed fears of alleged plans of manipulation, inducement, intimidation, disruption of process and deployment of fake National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) members, among others.
