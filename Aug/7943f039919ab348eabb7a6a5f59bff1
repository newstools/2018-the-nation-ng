The police in Niger State have arrested truck thieves at Sabo Wuse in Tafa Local Government. The suspects, Samson Audu, 32, Philip Amodu, 25, Safiu Amisu, 29 and Ismaila Aburata, 27, were nabbed by detectives attached to Tafa Division, following a tip-off. The Nation learnt that the suspects had stolen a yellow Iveco truck registered as Lagos KTU 422 XP, which belonged to Sinoma Kun-Shan Chinese Company in Lagos. The vehicle was brought to the North for sale. One of the suspects, Umar Haruna, a driver in the company, was said to have diverted the truck from Lagos to Niger State to look for a buyer. The truck was to have been sold for N3 million, but luck ran out on the suspects, as they were arrested before they could get a buyer. One of the suspects, Audu, said Haruna, now at large, was the one who suggested that they should steal and sell the vehicle. He said he did not know how and where Haruna got the truck from. “Haruna will be in a better position to explain where he got the truck. Ours is to look for a buyer and collect our commission. We have been in this business for some time. This is not the first time people are bringing vehicles to us to look for buyers.” Command spokesman Muhammad Abubakar said Umar Haruna is at large, “but we are trailing him.”
