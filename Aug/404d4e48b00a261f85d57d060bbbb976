The All Progressives Congress (APC) has said it is yet to release a timetable for the conduct of primaries for elective offices ahead of the 2019 general election. It said in a statement by Acting National Publicity Secretary Yekini Nabena that the timetable in the social media was the figment of the imagination of those who originated it. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to a timetable circulating in the social media and published today (August 23), purportedly for the APC primaries for state House of Assembly, National Assembly, Governorship and Presidential elections. “The timetable is fake and should be disregarded. The party is yet to announce its official timetable for the primaries.” Parties are expected to inform the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of the timetable for their primaries on or before September 15 and have till the end of October to conclude the processes.”
