A 45-year-old man, Isaac Olawale, has asked a Mushin Customary Court to dissolve his marriage because his wife, Oyindamola, was “disrespectful.” Isaac, an Economics graduate, said he was no longer interested in the seven-year-old marriage, blessed with two children. According to him, Oyindamola, who also has a B.Sc in Economics, is fond of disobeying him. “Throughout the years after our marriage on March 20, 2011, my wife always disregard my instructions. I kept telling her things I don’t want repeatedly, but to her, I complain a lot and she more often than not went against my words,” he said. He also claimed that she closed down the shop he rented for her after a year because she wanted a government job. “My wife said she doesn’t want to be self-employed that she wants a government job. She turned down all my reasonable offers. But I know it’s an excuse to display her laziness. “I have lost trust in her, Oyindamola is no longer my friend; please separate us,” he pleaded. Oyindamola, 40, who did not deny her husband’s claims, said he misunderstood her intentions. “All I wanted as a graduate was to work in a government organisation. The shop my husband got me, I appreciate it, but it wasn’t challenging enough. I just really wish to work in a government establishment,” Oyindamola said. She explained that she does random jobs that earn her money, “but Isaac is the one who fends for my two kids and I. My husband is trying; I still want to be in this marriage. I don’t want to divorce my husband. Please, I pray for settlement.” The presiding judges, Mrs. E.E Amuka-Pemu, Mrs. Yetunde Ogundo and Mrs. N.M Fashanu, advised the couple to maintain peace and adjourned till August 16.
