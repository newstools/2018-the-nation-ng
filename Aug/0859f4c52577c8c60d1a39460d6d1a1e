The police have arrested two men for allegedly robbing in traffic. David Okon, 32, and Ibe Okonne, 27, said to be wanted criminals, were arrested at Mazamaza on Badagry Expressway. It was gathered that they were caught by plaincloth policemen, while terrorising road users. In a statement yesterday, the police said the undercover agents apprehended them as they were robbing a woman simply identified as Oluwatosin. “They had succeeded in dispossessing their victim of her phone and other valuables before they were arrested by the eagle-eyed policemen attached to Raider team, Area E Command, Festac Town, who had observed uneasiness in the woman’s encounter with the suspects,” said the statement by police spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent (CSP). Oti said the suspects confessed to the crime, adding that the stolen items have been returned to the owner. He said: “To forestall incidence of traffic robbery along Maza-Maza/Mile Two, Oshodi/ Airport Road, Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal has deployed additional undercover operatives and motorised patrol teams to beef up security in the areas.” Photo caption: Okon (bearded) and Okonne.
