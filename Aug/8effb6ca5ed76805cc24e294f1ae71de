State NYSC Coordinator, Mrs Florence Yaakugh also confirmed the incident. Yaakugh said that the seven bodies have been recovered while the search for the other two bodies was still ongoing by the locals in collaboration with security agencies and the NYSC. While describing the incident as most regrettable and unfortunate, Yaakugh said that the NYSC would soon have the identity of all the Corps members involved and make such known appropriately. “We have information indicating that about nine of our Corps members were drowned in Gashaka on Saturday. “So far, seven bodies have been recovered and we are working with other relevant persons to recover the rest and to identify the persons. “This is a very sad development and the entire NYSC family in Taraba state is already thrown into deep mourning,” she said.
