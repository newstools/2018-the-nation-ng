Former Anambra Governor Peter Obi said Nigeria needs men of vision with proven track records to wake from stupor. He spoke yesterday at the 2018 Making Nigeria Great conference organised by the Summit Bible Church at Abuja. Obi, who looked at the trajectory of the nation’s development from 1980-date, bemoaned Nigeria’s backwardness. He compared Nigeria to a car with knocked engine, insisting the engine must be fixed first even before the question of who drives it arises. “To make Nigeria great is a welcome development which Nigerians are called to work towards. However, we must at all times recognise where we are and what should be done. “In our own case, we have lost it completely as a country. The idea of greatness is good but we must start from doing basic things. “We cannot aim to build skyscraper when we cannot maintain simple toilets. I believe as St. Theresa of the Child Jesus said, that greatness consists in doing small things in an extraordinary way,” Obi said. Other speakers at the event were Mr. Osita Chidoka and Leke Alder. They submitted Nigeria needs a man of vision to move on.
