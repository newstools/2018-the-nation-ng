President Muhammadu Buhari sends warm greetings to the matriarch of the Elumelu family, Mrs Suzanne Elumelu, on her 90th birthday. President Buhari joins family and friends of the kind-hearted and loving mother of five, including Chairman of Heirs Holdings and Founder, The Tony Elumelu Foundation, Tony Elumelu, in celebrating the milestone, which is an evidence of God’s favour and grace. The President commends Mrs Elumelu, who is fondly called Mama, for her strength of character and entrepreneurial spirit in raising a strong and healthy family, and her advocacy for good education and investment skills for children and women particularly in the country. President Buhari believes Mama’s life story of succeeding against the odds of early widowhood  serves as an inspiration to many, while her virtues of the fear of God, discipline, integrity, dedication and hard work will continue to resonate among the communities of the less privileged that she supports and regularly encourages. The President prays that God will grant Mama Elumelu, the Adadioranma of Onicha Ugbo, Delta State, longer life, filled with joy and good health.
