After over one year of muscle-flexing on the review of the Olubadan Chieftaincy Declaration, members of the Olubadan-In-Council yesterday met at the palace of the Olubadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji. The high chiefs, who have been elevated to the rank of obas, met with the top monarch at his Popoyemoja, Ibadan palace. The royal fathers had been locked in a battle over the review since the enthronement of members of the council by the state government in August last year. The new obas jettisoned the palace for regular meetings and opted for Mapo Hall as their new venue. But Oba Saliu did not join them at the historic hall, insisting that his palace is the right place to hold such meetings. He also did not recognise their new ranks, saying they remained high chiefs. But Ibadan elders and the leadership of the Central Council of Ibadan Indigenes (CCII), last week, facilitated a resolution of the crisis. One of the high chiefs and former Governor Rashidi Ladoja was said to have played a huge role in the reconciliation. Ladoja, who is the Osi Olubadan, as well as Oba Lekan Balogun, who is the Otun Olubadan, had met with Oba Adetunji at the Popoyemoja palace at the weekend, a sign of true reconciliation after one year. The decision for yesterdayâ€™s meeting was said to have been taken at the three-man meeting. The Nation gathered that the new obas arrived the palace at noon but Oba Adetunji reportedly did not meet them until about two hours later. When he surfaced, a source told The Nation, the monarch told them that he would not like to hold the meeting without Ladoja and the Iyalode of Ibadan, Chief Mrs Aminat Abiodun. The source added that Ladoja had hinted the monarch that he would not attend the meeting due to a more pressing engagement. The visit signalled the imminent end of the one-year crisis.
