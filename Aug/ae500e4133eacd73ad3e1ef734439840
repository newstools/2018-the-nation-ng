Nigerian fans have shaded singer Oritsefemi for saying he is the best artiste ever to come out of the country. The musician who got national fame with the release of his song, ‘Double Wahala’ made the declaration on Twitter. “I know some people will be waiting for me to buy dem car before dey play my songs that I just drop lately,” he tweeted. “Later still give all the award to dem people too… am still the best artist Nigeria has produced.. from me as a 7yr old boy till date still I sing.” In another tweet, he posted “Hypocrites,” before he tweeted another post, “Them sha no fit pursue me for my own country, that na one thing I knw for sure.” However, many Nigerians threw flaks at him. A poster, igwegeorgiano, on Nairaland, wrote, ‘just wondering which brand of weed oritsefemi smoke. if u re the greatest artist ever then where will you keep the likes of king sunny ade, ebenezer obey etc?.’ Another Nairaland poster, Alejoc, wrote: ‘Anybody is free to say anything!.’ However, few posters like Bustinsole supported Oritsefemi’s criticisms. “Nothin work in Naija xcept u bribe ur way in,” he said, “das d logic.”
