Super Eagles forward Alex Iwobi enjoyed Arsenal’s first victory in the new season on Saturday.  Iwobi who only recently sealed a new contract extension with the Emirates landlords that will see him remain in the club till 2022, saw 46 minutes action in the tie against hard fighting West Ham before making way for Frenchman Alexandre Lacazette. Visiting West Ham had shot into the lead into a surprise lead in the 25th minute thanks to Austra import Marko Arnautrovic. Although Iwobi and his teammates made frantic efforts to turn the table immediately, it was not until the 30th minute that the equaliser came with the Nigerian providing the needed assist for Nacho Monreal. An own goal by Issa Diop in the 70th minute increased the tally for the Arsenal side that was determined to avoid another defeat and eager to sing victory song. A timely blend between Bellerin and Danny Welbeck in the two minutes of added time finally added the icing on the cake for Arsenal who ran away with a 3-1 victory. The triumph on Saturday is coming after the side had suffered back to back defeats in the hands of defending champions Manchester City and Chelsea respectively. Interestingly Manchester City who had recorded two victories in two matches scoring eight goals in the bargain were surprisingly held to a 1-1 draw by new comers Wolverhampton Wanderers.
