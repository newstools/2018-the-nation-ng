Parents and guardians have been urged to recognise their children’s  creativity and assist them to grow it. They got the advice at  the maiden graduation of Kingdom Garrison International College in Minna, Niger State. The guest speaker, Mr Famous Osamulu, who spoke on: ‘Education and creativity’ stated that the weight thrown on literacy should also be thrown on creativity, adding that skillful people have never lacked placement in life. Osamulu lamented that education has made parents desirous of enforcing careers on their children instead of giving them the leverage to versatility. “The schools sector should also encourage creativity in children so they do not to lose their creative side. It would be noted that children are loads of creative minds and should be nurtured with utmost sensitivity,”he said. The school’s Proprietress, Pastor Flora Ojo Peters, appreciated God for bringing to reality a dream of many years. She said God had been faithful in the just-concluded academic session as the children’s performance was quite encouraging in both academics and extra-curricular activities. He praised parents and guardians for having faith in the institution to release their wards for their upkeep. Peters expressed optimism that next session would be bigger and better as Kingdom Garrison International College would upgrade. Some of the presentations by pupils include: music, talk shows, career talks and recitations. The best performing and outstanding students were rewarded with various gifts.
