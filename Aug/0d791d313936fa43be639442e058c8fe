The Delta State Assembly has approved Governor Ifeanyi Okowa’s request to extend the tenure of the board of Delta State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission (DESOPADEC) by six months. The approval followed the motion moved by Majority Leader Tim Owhefere, which was seconded by Mrs. Erhiatake Ibori-Suenu (PDP-Ethiope West). The motion was adopted when the Speaker, Sheriff Oborevwori, put it to a voice vote. Oborevwori read the governor’s letter in which he said DESOPADEC’s board expired on Monday. Okowa said the request for the board’s tenure extension was in line with Section 7 (2b) of the DESOPADEC Amendment Law, 2018, praying the assembly to approve it by six months. The Assembly also received another letter from the governor, nominating, Mr. Benjamin Igo and Dr. Frank Atube, for as Chairman and Secretary, Delta Bureau of Local Government Pension. Igo retired as a permanent secretary from the civil service. Consequently, the Speaker directed the nominees to submit 35 copies of their Curriculum Vitae to the Office of the Clerk of the House, and appear for screening today.
