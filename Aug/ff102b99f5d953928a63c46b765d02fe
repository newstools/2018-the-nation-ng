A man, Daniel Ekwerekwu, yesterday fell and died while trying to evade arrest after allegedly vandalising a car. Ekwerekwu was said to have attempted to jump a fence at Okungade Street, Mende in Maryland, Lagos,  while being chased by the police and some people. He was said to have miscalculated and hit his head on the floor, shattering his skull. According to the police, one of the owners of the cars he allegedly vandalised had sighted him while preparing for church and raised the alarm. The alarm, it was gathered, attracted a police patrol team and others in the neighbourhood, who went after him. “They chased the thief who ran into a building. He tried to scale the fence but unfortunately for him, his hands slipped off the wall and he landed on a cemented floor breaking his skull as a result. “When the police searched his trouser pockets, they recovered a voter’s card bearing his name and picture. “He was taken to Mainland Hospital, Yaba, Lagos Mainland, where he was confirmed dead. The body was thereafter deposited at the hospital’s morgue for autopsy,” police spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), said. Oti said the voter’s card and the car keys found on him led to the recovery of a dark blue saloon car marked KRD708DK.
