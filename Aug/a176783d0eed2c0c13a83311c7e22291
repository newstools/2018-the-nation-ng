Constipation is common in menopause. It is typically defined as being unable to have more than three complete bowel movements within a week. Constipation is considered chronic if it lasts for three months or longer. When you are constipated, it can be difficult to completely void your bowels.

You may be uncomfortable or have an overall sluggish feeling. Occasional constipation is not unusual and has a wide range of causes in addition to menopause. You can even have multiple causes simultaneously. What’s the link?  Menopause happens when your menstrual cycles have ended for at least a year. It’s earmarked by a drop in female hormones such as estrogen and progesterone. These hormones affect many areas of the body, including the digestive tract. As a result of this hormone drop, some postmenopausal women experience constipation. However, changes in bowel routine can begin even before menopause, during perimenopause. Estrogen is responsible for many things including keeping cortisol levels low. Cortisol is a hormone associated with stress. When estrogen declines, cortisol levels rise. This can slow down the digestive process, lengthening the amount of time it takes for food to break down. This can make stool more difficult to pass. Too little progesterone can cause your colon to slow down. The longer food waste remains in your colon, the dryer it gets. Stool also tends to be dryer when estrogen and progesterone levels are low. Some postmenopausal women also have weakened pelvic floor muscles. This can make it difficult to eliminate stool, especially when it is hard and dry. As women age, they may also need medications which have constipation listed as a possible complication. These medications include:
