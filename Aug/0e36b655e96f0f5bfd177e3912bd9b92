Ahead of 2019 general elections, the physically-challenged people in Lagos State have promised the All Progressives Congress (APC) three million votes. The leader of the group Mr Israel Akiode made the promise yesterday at a solidarity rally held at the APC Secretariat, ACME Road, Ikeja. He said official record shows that there were four million people living with one disability or the other in the state. Akiode said the leadership have been mobilising members to register and collect their Permanent Voterâ€™s Card (PVC). He advised members that have not registered as APC members to go and register in their wards. According to him, only card carrying members of the APC would be allowed to take part in the direct primaries for choosing party candidates for general elections. He commended Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode and the entire leadership of APC in the state for recognising the physically-challenged and incorporating them in the party executives at the ward, local and state levels.
