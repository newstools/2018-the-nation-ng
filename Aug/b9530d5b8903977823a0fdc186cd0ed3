LESS than a week of their defection to the opposition PDP , the 18 lawmakers of the Sokoto State House of Assembly boastfully expressed their readiness to answer any questions or inquiries from the Economy and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) or any other security agents upon invitation. Confirming their stand to reporters, a member representing ,Silame local government  area in the Sokoto State House of Assembly, Hon. Atiku Liman Gande, said they were undoubtedly ready to honour and grant EFCC, if invited. Gande described such invitation as normal if caused, stressing that” its not a new thing and if served,  we will honour it and respond to any questions which we are aware of as appropriate.” The lawmaker continued: ” even if  the EFCC are  after us, as far as I am concerned, we have nothing to fear about their actions.” Gande, hitherto, said they were not corrupt and as such, nothing to hide with regards to EFCC’s inquiries against them even as he added” we are not aware of the development that the EFCC may pursue us.” Meanwhile,  reports saying EFCC had invited the State Accountant General in connection with the state governor’s defection to PDP remain a pulse that is currently generating serious concerns especially among government officials in the state.
