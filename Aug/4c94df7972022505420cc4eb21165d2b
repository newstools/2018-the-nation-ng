The Convener of youth advocacy group ‘Together for Everybody: Working for Everyone’ Mr. Uche Annie-Okonkwo, has demanded an apology from the Department of State Service (DSS), over “the unacceptable invasion” of the National Assembly. Annie-Okonkwo, who is aspiring to represent Idemili North/ South Federal Constituency of Anambra State on the platform of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), described the security operatives’ action as embarrassing. He said: “There are behaviours that are not just unacceptable, but also pointedly so grievous and completely abhorrent. No worse act can be this abhorrent than the rehearsed anarchy rendered in dark hoods by the DSS upon this often harassed symbol of our democracy. It was an absurd theatre with no sense.” He commended the Presidency for the prompt acting by sacking the then head of the DSS. “Yes, it was good news that the architect of this script was sacked. I advise and dare to demand that on behalf of Nigerians, an apology from the DSS is not just expedient but a healthy step to take.” He urged Nigerian youths to work hard and continue the mobilisation to play active role in the 2019 general election.
