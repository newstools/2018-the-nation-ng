President Muhammadu Buhari said on Wednesday that development is usually the first casualty in an unstable polity. The President stated this while receiving President Adama Barrow of The Gambia at State House, Abuja. In a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President said: “The best route to national development is stability. When a country is not stable, you spend most of your financial resources on security. “That is the money that should have gone into education, infrastructure and generating employment for the people, particularly youths.” He congratulated President Barrow for stabilizing The Gambia after his emergence, following the impasse caused by his predecessor, Yahya Jammeh, who refused to vacate office after losing the December 2016 presidential election. The Gambian President thanked President Buhari for the role Nigeria played in helping his country return to the path of constitutional democracy. He also congratulated the Nigerian President on his emergence as the new Chairman of ECOWAS, noting that he was the first foreign leader to visit Abuja after the development.
