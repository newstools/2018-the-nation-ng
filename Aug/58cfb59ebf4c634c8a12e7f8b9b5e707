Nigeria born British boxer Anthony Joshua can hardly wait to add another knock out to his bag of laurels.  Joshua who is leaving no stone unturned in his training ahead of all important clash against Alexander Povetkin appears ready for bout even if re-scheduled into a less than 72 hours affair The massive calorie burning Joshua shared a video of his workout on Instagram and looks in great condition ahead showdown. The WBO, WBA and IBF world heavyweight champion worked on his cardio with a session on the exercise bike. He also strengthened his neck muscles by flexing against a giant pilates ball on the wall. Wearing a white vest and shorts with his headphones on, Joshua appeared to be working himself hard but cracked a smile for the camera on the treadmill. That fitness and neck strength could be crucial against Alexander Povetkin, his next opponent on September 22. The Russian is a power puncher and wily veteran who will pose a stern test of the former Olympic champion’s 21-0 professional record. Victories over the 38-year-old at Wembley will set-up a mega-fight against Deontay Wilder or Tyson Fury who have agreed to lock horns in the interim. It seems that Joshua is refusing to be sidetracked with the prospect of those massive contests in the pipeline as he continues to get in shape with less than a month until he faces Povetkin.
