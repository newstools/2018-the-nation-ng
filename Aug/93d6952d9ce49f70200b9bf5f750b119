The Oyo State government has warned all trespassers on its land holdings across the state, particularly in Ajoda, Egbeda local government area where its estates are located to desist from such practice noting that legal machinery are already in place to deal precisely against defaulters. The state government through the state housing corporation also urged members of the public not to patronise land grabbers who are parading themselves as legal owners of parts of the Corporation’s land holding especially at Ajoda New Town, saying such patronage would amount to falling victim of land fraud. The Corporations in a release signed by the Acting General Manager, Mr. Samuel Adekunle and Director, Public Relations and Information, Mr Kunle Sanni reiterated that the government through the agency is still in full control of the about five thousand hectares of land, located within the Egbeda LG of the state. Faulting the claims of the alleged land grabbers, the Corporation recalled that a magistrate court sitting at Ejioku gave a judgement in its favour by refusing all the prayers of the applicant and subsequently dismissing the application brought against the Corporation. Advising anybody interested in buying land at Ajoda New Town to approach the Corporation or conduct necessary verification and or search in order not to fall victim of fraud, Oyo State Housing corporation said it has renewed its commitment to surpass its revenue target for the year and generate income to the coffers of the state by inaugurating a task force for revenue generation. According to the Corporations AGM, Mr Adekunle, the eight member committee will among other things “identify new sources of revenue, monitor distribution of bills to clients in respect of such payments, make a follow-up and ensuring that clients settle bills promptly, compile and collate suns paid on such sources of revenues on each estate of the Corporation and give weekly report to the management through the revenue supervisory committee members.” While imploring members of the task force to see their appointment as a call to duty to turn around the fortune of the Oyo state Housing corporation, the AGM during the inauguration urged the entire staff to key into the policy of the state government aim of making government and parastatals self sustaining. He said if all the available revenue sources to the Corporation are adequately tapped, the agency will surpass its revenue target for the year
