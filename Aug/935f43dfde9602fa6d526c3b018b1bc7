Adamawa State Chapter, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) has blamed the failure of the Federal Government  to keep its promise, for the high cost of local rice in the country. Its Chairman, Stephen Maduwa, who spoke in an interview  with The Nation in Yola, the state capital, said the government had promised last year to help fix the challenges confronting local rice farmers, especially by providing solar-powered pumping machines for the rice farms to reduce farmers spending on diesel and petrol. Specifically, he said the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, made the promise, lamenting that over a year after, that the promise has not been kept. He said the cost of local rice would continue to rise. He added that the farmers buy water-pumping machines at very high cost, petrol, diesel as well as high cost of labour without any form of incentives from the government. Local rice is currently being sold between N16, 000 and N17, 000 but the ministry had promised a bag of rice will sell for N10, 000 before December last year. “The cost of local rice will continue to be high until the government is ready to trim it down. I put that to the minister in our last meeting. I told him we get pumping machine at very high cost, diesel and petrol are also costly. There and then, he promised us he was bringing in three-inch solar pumping machines through his ministry but up to this moment, we have not got anything. It’s more than a year now,” Maduwa said.
