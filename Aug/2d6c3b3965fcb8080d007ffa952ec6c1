Nigeria Under 18 and 20 male teams have won the African leg of the IHF Challenge Trophy, which came to an end yesterday in Kigali, Rwanda. The under 18 team defeated Guinea 45-31, while the under 20 boys narrowly beat DR Congo 27-26 to emerge the continental champions. Both teams have qualified for the World Championship billed for Spain later this year and will also play at the Cadet and Junior Nations Cup in Marrakech, Morocco from September 6 to 15. The Secretary General of the Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN), Mohammed Haruna Ilerika stated that the victories were results of hardwork and commended the players and technical crew for their industry. “The victories are result of hard work and determination on the part on the players, technical crew and awesome support of the HFN board. “At the inception of the board, we promised Nigerians not to judge us on short results but what we are able to do in the long run. The results on the short run are surprising and encouraging. We remain focused and steadfast in our resolve to put Nigeria handball on a high pedestal,” Ilerika added.
