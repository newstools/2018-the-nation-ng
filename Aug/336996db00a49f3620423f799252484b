He resigned following  hints that 31 members of the state House of Assembly, signed his impeachment notice, which would be tabled before the house on Monday. Abubakar  has been having a running battle with his boss over issues bordering on loyalty between the Gandujiyya and Kwankwasiyya group of his intention to resign his position. In a letter, dated August 1, 2018, addressed to the Governor, Dr Abduallahi Umar Ganduje, Professor Hafiz said” : I would desire to remain up to the end of our tenure in order to fulfill the aspirations and expectations of the good people of Kano State, as expressed in their joint ticket in 2015. ”But with the current and persistent   irreconcilable differences on matters relating to governance and government operations, personal opinions and the concept of, and  respect for democratic  ideals and values, it would be unfair to my conscience to the good people of Kano State and  you, as the head of the Government to continue to remain in my position as the Deputy Governor.” Abubakar, a University Professor was said to have resigned his position and will join his political godfather, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso, who defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the ruling APC. The deputy governor of Kano State has personally refuted speculations that he had defected from the  APC to the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. The Nation earlier reported that speculations were rife in the state last Wednesday that the academic and a Professor in Nutrition at Bayero University Kano, will quit his office. Abubakar has been under pressure from the governor’s loyalists to resign or face impeachment.
