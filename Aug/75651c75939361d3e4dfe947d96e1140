A group, Campaign for Democracy (CD) has given the federal government a 14-day ultimatum to overhaul the Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC) or face massive street protests. The group based its call on allegations of corruption and human right abuses against the commission, lamenting that graft was becoming the order of day among officials of FRSC. In a statement signed by the group’s publicity secretary, Dede Uzor, CD said in spite of efforts by individuals and organisations to restrain the commission from sliding into the bandwagon of corruption, it had continued to inexorably decay. “We hereby give the federal government 14-day ultimatum to overhaul the FRSC. If nothing is done at the end of the 14th day, we will mobilise our members and the masses to protest the human right abuses of Nigerians by the commission. “The FRSC has indirectly increased the cost of acquiring new driver’s licence between N25, 000 to N30, O00 from about N6, 500. “As if that isn’t enough, Nigerians are made to pay almost the same amount when they want to renew their licences. This is not what is obtained abroad. This is gross cheating. “They have abandoned their mandate of ensuring safety on the roads to full commercialization of FRSC,” it said. CD noted that the states in the southeast as well as Delta were worst victims of the exorbitant driver’s licence renewal fees, calling at the FRSC office at Bridgehead Onitsha. “They have civilian agents who collect money for them from overloaded vehicles. Bridgehead has become very attractive for them. Even when the police and army have left the place to allow free flow of traffic, FRSC still blocks the bridge and cause avoidable traffic jam,” said the group.
