Armed men struck afresh at  Tse- Ujo village, in Katsina Ala Local Government Area of  Benue State on Thursday killing 10 persons, according to residents. The hoodlums invaded the village at about 8am allegedly in search of a rival gang member but left disappointed as they did not find him. They were said to have returned in the evening and when they still did not find their target, decided to vent their anger on innocent villagers, shooting indiscriminately. The police said yesterday that nine were killed.  Spokesman for the state’s police command, Moses Yamu, a deputy superintendent, said policemen had been drafted to the area. Governor Samuel Ortom condemned the incident and asked  security agencies to go after the bandits. The governor described the attack as unacceptable. Ortom, in a statement through his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, assured the people of Katsina-Ala that steps had been taken to prevent further attacks in the area, adding that three persons had been arrested in connection with the attack. The governor also reassured the people of the state that his administration will not allow armed militia to continue to terrorize communities. “He encouraged anyone with information that can lead to the apprehension of other  gang members to contact the police, Department of State Services or the military,” Akase said.
