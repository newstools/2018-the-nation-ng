Civil society group Coalition Against Corruption and Bad Governance, (CACOBAG) has requested the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to probe sacked Director General of the Department of State Service (DSS) Lawal Daura’s alleged involvement with foreign accounts. The group, with bias for ant-graft, in a statement said it had prepared a petition to be forwarded to the EFCC. It also expressed its readiness to ask the court to compel the EFCC to heed its call should the antti-corrption agency fail yo act. In a statement by its Chairman Alhaji Toyin Raheem, CACOBAG said It had called on the EFCC to unravel the mystery face behind the name Auwalu Kallamu, which it believed is a “pseudo name used to operate two foreign accounts into which over £3million” for an operation was traced. The group raised the possibility of the cash being linked to secueity chief, hence its call for a probe of the DSS DG. CACOBAG said information available to it showed that foreign investigators were probing alleged diversion of millions of Euros by a Nigerian security chief using the pseudo name of Auwalu Kallamu. The group added that the Nigerian suspect with Niger Republic dual nationality was said to have worked with other foreigners including an Israeli following which Israeli police investigated the matter andarersted one of its citizens and others on account of bribery and corrupting foreign government officials. “CACOBAG is determined to see that the investigation on this matter is not stalled. We have trust that the EFCC will save us from the ridicule brought upon the country by the fake Kallamu. “This is by exposing him and punishing him according to our law. Only this will prove to the world our seriousness in the fight against corruption.”
