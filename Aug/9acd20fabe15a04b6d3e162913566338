An aspirant to the northern senatorial district seat of Cross River State, Comrade Godwin Nyiam, has said the Senate should not serve a place for governors to retire to after their tenures in their various states. Nyiam, who intends to pursue his ambition on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), said the senate is supposed to be a place for vibrant people with the capacity to bring good governance to their constituents, not for those who have exhausted their ideas. “Unfortunately, in Nigeria, the National Assembly has become an office for past and immediate past Governors who are supposed to have joined the retirees club because they no longer have something in stock to offer to their people,” he said. The senatorial hopeful called on the electorates not to vote past governors but instead vote people fresh people with fresh ideas to enable them make laws that can improve the fortunes of the country. “I see myself as a young person with capacity to perform, given the fact that I haven’t stolen money from anywhere to make it possible for operatives of the Economic and Financial Commission EFCC to chase me about to make me lose focus. This will make me function well. It is not all about money or god-fatherism, but about the passion for the service,” he said. Nyiam said he would sponsor bills that would be not just relevant to his constituency but to the entire country if he successfully gets to the Senate. “The National Assembly should not be a place for retirees, but a place for researchers. Readers are leaders. Why don’t we look at what is happening in developed nations of the world, instead of sending people who were supposed to join the retirees club to go make laws for us. Sending such retirees to represent the people in the legislature negatively impacts on the socio-political economy of the nation,” Nyiam said.
