Eight-time Olympic Gold medallist Usain Bolt has admitted that he is yet to fully get used to the changeable pace of top level football even as prepares to make his official game debut for Central Coast Mariners on Friday. Bolt, who played a friendly during a trial with Norwegian side Stromsgodset earlier in the year, admitted he would be nervous as he took another step towards his dream of being a professional footballer. “There will be nerves,” the 100m world record holder told reporters. “It’s not like it is a charity game anymore, this is a career that I am pursuing. “I expect to make mistakes but also to make myself proud and to push myself. I know I am not going to have a perfect game. “I have been playing on the left wing so far, that is where I have been placed and what I am working with. I am not used to going up and down in speed, back and forth. I think that is the most challenging thing. “It is all about practicing, going through the rounds and pushing myself to try and get used to the system. I have time, so I am going to take my time to learn new ways and continue pushing.” Bolt said former Reading midfielder Kalifa Cisse, who played one season in the Premier League with the Royals in 2007-08, had been helping him to prepare for Australian football. “He is really explaining to me, and he has been in the Premier League,” Bolt said of the former Mali international. “So he has explained the level and he has explained how this league is and how they play here and how he thinks I should play so far. “We have been talking a lot and he has been explaining to me a few things. So he has been key so far.” It is however apparent that the Jamaican will only be allowed average playing time for now as he has not been properly listed in coach Mike Mulvey squad. Can the 32 year old make a success of the round leather game just like he made on the tracks?  Time no doubt will tell.
