…says it’s poised for victory in 2019  The African Democratic Congress (ADC) will elect the state chairman and other party officers Tuesday. It had earlier conducted congresses where officers were elected into the 236 wards and 20 Local Governments across Ogun State. The State Chairman of the party, Dr. Gbolade Osinowo who disclosed this to The Nation in Abeokuta, said the essence is to put party executives in place as parts of preparation to position ADC for successes in the forthcoming general elections in Ogun. Osinowo added that the conduct of the congress was in line with the provisions of the ADC constitution and described the exercise as the first step to victory for the party in the 2019 governorship, senatorial, House of Representatives, House of Assembly and LGAs elections in the state. “I assure Ogun residents and Nigerians that the leadership of ADC at the state and national level is set to provide a responsible and responsive opposition till we takeover in 2019. “This is against the alarming scenario of the unyielding actions, unemployment, economic lull, insecurity created by the ruling party that has failed to admit its failure to deliver the professed ‘Change’. “The firsthand feelers from the electorate and residents indicate that a significant number of them are disillusioned with the style of governance adopted by the ruling party in the state and determined to seek alternative platform. “A lot of civil servants, artisans and investing public are tired of poverty inflicted on the people by the ruling party, they described as an expired drug and they can’t wait for ADC to subvert it.”
