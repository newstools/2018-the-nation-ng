An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain in Ekiti State, Senator Ayo Arise, has unfolded his senatorial ambition in Ekiti North District. Arise represented Ekiti North in the sixth Senate between 2007 and 2011 where he served as the Chaiman of Committee on Privatisation. The politician inaugurated his ward and local government coordinators in Oye-Ekiti to kickstart consultations with party leaders ahead of the APC National Assembly primaries. He said President Muhammadu Buhari needed National Assembly members who will cooperate with him to translate his dream for Nigeria into reality. Arise also pledged to work with Ekiti State governor-elect, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, and assist his home state to get what is due to it in the federation. He promised to give Ekiti North vibrant representation better than what he did between 2007 and 2011, which was regarded as the golden era for the people of the district. Arise said Buhari has set the country on the path of greatness  infrastructural revolution and development. He said: “To say Nigeria is now working on the path of greatness will be an understatement going by the level of industrial and infrastructural revolution going on across the country under the present administration of President Buhari.
