The leadership of Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) yesterday called for a three-day prayer to be observed in all churches. This followed the political drama unfolding in the country. The development, CAN said, was becoming embarrassing and constituting threat to democracy. A statement by the Special Assistant (Media & Communications) to the CAN President, Pastor Adebayo Oladeji: said: “The prayer is for divine protection for our nation and democracy. “We request all bloc chairmen, zonal chairmen, state chairmen, local and all church leaders to mobilise our members nationwide for a three-day prayer from August 27 to 29 to seek the face of God concerning the social and political state of our nation and for peaceful conduct of 2019 elections. “We are to pray that God should frustrate the efforts of evil men among our politicians and to prevent them from being elected into any office in 2019. “We should pray for peaceful co-existence and an end to bloodshed and violence caused by suspected herdsmen, bandits, ritual killers, robbers and other hoodlums. “We should pray that God should guide our leaders aright. We should pray for the release of Leah Sharibu and the remaining Chibok girls, together with those in the captivity of insurgents throughout the nation. We should pray for economic prosperity of the nation. “We should pray for unity and mutual respect for one another.”
