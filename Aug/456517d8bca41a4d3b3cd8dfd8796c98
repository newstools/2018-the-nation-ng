For returning a passenger’s bag, two workers of a security firm at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja have been rewarded with N250,000 each. Daniel Achi and Francis Emepueaku of Halogen Securities Limited (HSL) returned the bag containing foreign currencies and other valuables, which they found at  the airport’s multi-storey car park on August 18. A woman, who just arrived from the United States (US) had dropped the bag while helping her driver to move her luggage into the car boot. The firm said it honoured the duo to celebrate their honesty and exemplary conduct to the owner. It offered them scholarships to enable them acquire a Diploma in Security Management. HSL Group Managing Director Wale Olaoye described them as security heroes. Olaoye said their action indicated that something good could come out of Nigeria, appealing to other workers to emulate Achi and Emepueaku. He said: “Today, what we may see as inconsequential has caught global attention. It is work in progress and we are in the pursuit of excellence. If the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) didn’t give opportunities to Nigerians who have their teeth in their professional endeavours, we will not be celebrating what we are celebrating today”. In a message to HSL, Dr. Banji Oyegbami, a family friend of the owner of the lost bag, who witnessed what happened, expressed hope that Nigeria would be great again with such men of integrity. “I was really surprised at the level of honesty and integrity displayed by both of them and I think they should be commended. There is no doubt, Nigeria is going to be great again with their kind of new breed of professionals ”, he said.
