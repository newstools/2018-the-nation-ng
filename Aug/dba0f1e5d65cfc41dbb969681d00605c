Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal yesterday said he has what it takes to contest against President Muhammadu Buhari on the All Progressives Congress (APC) platform if he wanted. Tambuwal, reacting to a statement that he defected from the APC to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) because he feared it will be a tall dream for him to get an automatic ticket, insisted that he could have challenged President Buhari under the APC if that was what he wanted. He noted that if he did, only the votes of delegates could have produced a winner. Tambuwal stated this in his Tweeter handle “@Sokotogovthouse” as his reaction to the widely publicized statement that he hurriedly left the APC for fear of Buhari. He said: “If I wanted to and if the Presidency is what Ahmed Tinubu thinks I defected, I could contest with President Buhari under the APC. I have what it takes to have contested with Mr. President. “Tinubu tried to rock the boat when he was denied Buhari’s vice presidency. He thinks every other person could behave his way. If I wanted to contest under the APC as president, I could have done so and only the votes could have produced a winner. “In any case, Tinubu is confessing that there is no level-playing ground for all members of the APC; that there is no internal democracy in it and that some people were denied their right to internal democracy.” Tambuwal stressed that while addressing the people of Sokoto State and by implication, Nigerians, he stated his reasons for leaving the party (APC) none of which was “automatic ticket”. “I adduced reasons my defection to the PDP. The reasons are still on record. Automatic ticket by the APC is certainly not part of that,” Tambuwal said.
