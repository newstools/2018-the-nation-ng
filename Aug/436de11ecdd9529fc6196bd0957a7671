Serena Williams‘ daughter, Alexis Olympia, turns one on Saturday, but don’t be thinking Instagram will be flooded with party pictures. And that’s not because the tennis ace wants to keep things low key, in fact, there will be no celebration at all. The tennis star has confirmed that she won’t actually be celebrating her little one’s first birthday because of her belief as a Jehovah’s Witness. Speaking at a press conference at the US Open, Serena was asked whether she had thought about how she would celebrate Olympia’s first birthday. “Is there a birthday party planned?” the 36-year-old was asked by a reporter, to which she replied: “Olympia doesn’t celebrate birthdays. We’re Jehovah’s Witnesses, so we don’t do that.” According to JW.org: “Jehovah’s Witnesses do not celebrate birthdays because they believe that such celebrations displease God.” The site goes on to say that Jehovah’s Witnesses believe the celebration of birthdays has pagan roots and that early Christians did not celebrate birthdays. Speaking to Vogue last year about her faith, Serena explained that her husband, Alexis Ohanian, has also embraced her beliefs. “Being a Jehovah’s Witness is important to me, but I’ve never really practiced it and have been wanting to get into it,” she said. “Alexis didn’t grow up going to any church, but he’s really receptive and even takes the lead. He puts my needs first.”
