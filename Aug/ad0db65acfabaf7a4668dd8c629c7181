Ganduje called on the well-meaning Nigerians and corporate bodies to emulate the gesture for the development of the education sector. The Managing Director, Nigerian Breweries, Mr Jordi Borrut, said that the project was part of the company’s commitment in partnership with the state government to support the education sector. “We believe these infrastructures will improve the standard of education in schools and complement government’s efforts in the provision of basic, qualitative and affordable education in a conducive learning and teaching environment for students and teachers in order to build our future leaders,’’ he added. The Permanent Secretary, SERVICOM Directorate, Alhaji Abdullahi Musa, said the project came to reality due to the efforts of the directorate of ensuring that individuals and corporate bodies discharge their corporate social responsibilities to the state. Musa thanked the state government for allowing the company to execute the project and Dorayi Babba community for donating a piece of land to the school for the project.
