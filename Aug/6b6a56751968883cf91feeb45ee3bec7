Kenya’s deputy chief justice Philomena Mwilu was arrested on Tuesday for corruption allegations, failure to pay tax, and improper dealings with a local bank now in receivership, the police and the country’s top prosecutor said. Noordin Haji told a news conference that Mwilu had abused her office for personal gain, undermining public integrity in the judiciary. Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti told Reuters in a text message: “I can confirm the arrest of the deputy chief justice.” Reuters was unable to immediately contact representatives of Mwilu.
