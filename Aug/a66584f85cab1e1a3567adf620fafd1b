The Bayelsa State Chapter of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) wants  politicians to stop the ongoing   gale of defections, and play politics by the rules to safeguard democracy in the country. Mr. John Ndiomu, the state Chairman of NLC, told our reporters in Yenagoa,the state capital onFriday that political actors should instead focus on issues that  would drive Nigeria’s development. The chairman cautioned against repeating mistakes of the past, stressing that defection would not impact on national development in any form like job creation and provision of basic amenities. He said: “I will not say that our democracy is under threat or that we are going backward; my concern is that our politicians are yet to learn their lessons because the current issue of defection is indicating that they are going to repeat the old mistakes in the forthcoming elections. “My question here is: are the defectors defecting for the good interest of Nigerians or for their selfish interest? “It is high time we learned  from the past in order not to repeat the old mistakes. “In the forthcoming elections, we want politicians who have the interest of Nigerians at heart. “The electorate should be mindful not to vote for politicians that have failed the people.”
