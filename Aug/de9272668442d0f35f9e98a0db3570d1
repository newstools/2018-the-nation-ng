More men have registered in the ongoing Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC’s) Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) exercise, it was learnt yesterday. According to INEC’s update, of the over 12 million newly-registered voters, 6,856.558 million are men, while 5,832,234 are women. There are over seven million Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) awaiting collection. Besides, INEC’s update showed that 998,993 applied for replacement of voter cards, while 640,796 requested for transfer of vote. The exercise, which was to be suspended on August 17, has been extended to the last day of this month. INEC argued that the exercise, which had been on for the past 16 months, was extended due to pleas by Nigerians. It said: “Nigerians have appealed to the commission to extend the exercise. Consequently, INEC has decided to extend the CVR to August 31. The exercise will continue in all the designated registration centres every day, including weekends, but excluding public holidays, between 9am and 5pm.” The commission informed the public that the ongoing collection exercise would be on until very close to the general election. “INEC wishes to inform the public that the ongoing collection of PVCs will not end with the CVR exercise. Collection of PVCs will continue until close to the general election,” it said.
