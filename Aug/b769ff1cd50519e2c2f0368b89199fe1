An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court will on October 11 begin the trial of a man, Thomas Morgan Olufemi, who allegedly hired one ‘Terminator’ to threaten his ex-lover, Miss Adeleke Taiwo. Magistrate M.F. Onamusi fixed the date on August 6, following Olufemi’s not guilty plea to a three-count charge of conspiracy, assault and threat to life. Olufemi, 41, of No. 18A, Lugard Avenue, Ikoyi, and Terminator, said to be at large, were arraigned by the Onikan Police Division on a charge marked: Q/55/2018. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh alleged that the defendants conspired and committed the offences in Lagos at about 4pm on August 1, at Obalende in Eti-Osa Local Government Area (LGA). Mameh said the trouble began after Taiwo allegedly resisted Olufemi’s demand for custody of their baby. The court heard that Olufemi recruited an accomplice, who phoned Taiwo on her GSM No. 0909036….. The accomplice introduced himself to Taiwo as ‘Terminator’ and “threatened to terminate her life if she refused to comply with his warnings and demand…” Olufemi then went to No.30, Masalashi Street, Obalende, where Taiwo was seeking refuge with her friend, Okiti Steffi. A quarrel broke out and Olufemi allegedly assaulted Taiwo’s friend, Okiti Steffi, “by giving her a dirty slap on her left cheek.” Mameh told the court that the offences contravened sections 172, 232 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
