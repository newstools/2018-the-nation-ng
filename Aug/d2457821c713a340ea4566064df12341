The outgoing Ambassador of Denmark to Nigeria, Mr Torben Gettermann, has stressed the need for Nigerians to hold politicians, companies and individuals accountable to win anti-corruption crusade in the country. Gettermann, who said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja, said such was what helped his country to become one of the least corrupt countries in the world. “Denmark is one of the least corrupt countries in the world because we hold our politicians and our companies to account. “We need to do that for our politicians, individuals, companies to not only subscribe to the ideal of being transparent and non-corrupt but also to actually live it out. “We have a code of conduct for Danish companies. As public servants, we have to sign a declaration and we have to go through courses so that we know what corruption means,“ he said. He, however, said that Denmark could assist Nigeria in addressing the challenge in some ways. “What we can do is to highlight the situations and make sure that people talk about it, that action is taken to an extent possible. “Also go into cooperation with Nigeria on education in terms of understanding how much money corruption actually takes out of the system, money that the people in general could benefit from. “We have had Danish companies active in some of the task forces that have been set up here in Nigeria,” he said While noting that corruption in Nigerian ports was tremendous, he commended the efforts of the Federal Government to reduce it, stressing however that there was still much more to be done in the sector. He commended the present administration in the country for laying a good foundation in fighting corruption. “The current government in Nigeria has made a mark with the President Muhammadu Buhari being the anti-corruption champion in the AU.
