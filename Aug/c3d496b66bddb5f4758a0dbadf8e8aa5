Head of Nigeria National Office, West African Examinations Council (WAEC), Mr Olu Adenipekun, has emerged the Vice President of the Association for Educational Assessment in Africa (AEAA). He was elected for a one-year term during the 36th Annual Conference of the AEAA held in Maseru, Lesotho as successor to Dr Litsabako Ntoi of the Examinations Council of Lesotho (ECOL). The conference, which had as theme, “Reforming educational assessment: A renewed agenda”, had 325 delegates from 27 countries in attendance. Eighty-two papers were presented at the conference opened by the Minister of Education and Training of the Kingdom of Lesotho, Prof Ntoi Rapapa. In his keynote address, Rapapa said the theme was a wake-up call for assessment bodies, as the 21st century knowledge, skills and expertise requires them to review their role. He added that the need to integrate technology into assessment combined with the broadening array of candidates the assessment bodies have to cater for, have necessitated the introduction of new dimensions to the mandate of these bodies. AEAA is a non-profit making organisation established in 1982 to promote cooperation among examining and assessment bodies in Africa. During the closing ceremony, the baton for the hosting of the 37th Annual AEAA Conference was handed to WAEC Nigeria. In his acceptance speech, Adenipekun, said the conference, which will have as theme: “Innovations in educational assessment” will be hosted by WAEC Nigeria at the Ladi Kwali  Conference Centre, Sheraton Hotel, Abuja from August 5-9, 2019. The WAEC delegation to the 36th Annual AEAA Conference was led by the Registrar to Council, Dr. Iyi Uwadiae.
