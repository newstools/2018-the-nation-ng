Across section of soccer stakeholders in the country have raised the alarm that the ongoing crises rocking Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), would have multiple ripple effects on the Super Eagles’ chances of qualifying for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations. With a ding-dong tussle for control of The Glasshouse now unravelling each week between the groups of Amaju Pinnick and Chris Giwa, a class of stakeholders were unanimous early Thursday that preparations for the Eagles’ match away to Seychelles is already being hampered. After battling away to Seychelles on September 7, the Eagles will return to face Libya at home a week later, which means they have less than four weeks to prepare for two crucial matches, but nothing yet appears in place. Airing their views at a roundtable of analysis of topical football issues, the stakeholders warned that Nigeria might be on the verge of missing AFCON for the third edition running, considering that the NFF crises are distractions for the players, coaches and officials. One of the stakeholders lamented during a radio programme monitored in Lagos: “I fear for our chances of qualifying for next year’s Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroun, because nothing is yet in place in terms of preparations. “I wonder who will arrange for the Eagles’ camping and allowances. Who will give consent to Gernot Rohr’s team list? Who will the coach even report to? These are salient issues we have to settle immediately, otherwise, it will be doom for Nigeria again at AFCON 2019, which would be the third time running that we will not qualify. God forbid.”
