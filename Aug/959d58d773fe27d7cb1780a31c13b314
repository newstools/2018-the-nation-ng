No fewer than 200 widows have been empowered by an aspiring member of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Oladele Fasuyi. Fasuyi gave the widows cash and food items at the event held at the Ofako Ijaiye Mini Stadium. According to him, the gesture was to help the less privileged to make a living. He said it was necessary to reach out to the needy, adding: “I am concerned about their plight. The widows and the senior citizens should not be neglected. Focus is also placed on the young ones to enable them dream and believe in Nigeria again. It is believed that if young ones are meaningfully engaged, they will be at their best for the good of the society. I want the youths to change the mindset that nothing works, they should know that they can secure jobs and live a good life. The youths will be engaged to become information technology (IT) experts, and have a sustained means of livelihood.” Fasuyi urged widows not to give up on themselves, but to see a future in the country. “Our youths should also stay focused. Nigerians are not lazy, but they must move in the right direction. Many Nigerians do not have voter’s card; we all must get the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) and be interested in the political affairs in our country,” he said.
