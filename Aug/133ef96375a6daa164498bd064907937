Sacked D’Tigress coach, Sam Vincent has described his former players as wonderful and wished them well at the FIBA Women Basketball World Cup in Tenerife, Spain from September 22 to 30. While relieving Vincent of his duties on Friday, the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF) said the decision was taken in the best interest of all parties involved and the long term interest of the D’Tigress. NBBF also stated that considering the numerous conflicting commitments of the 55 year old coach which has continued to affect his duties as the coach of the team, the latest decision became pertinent. The basketball federation said that In view of the importance of giving the team the best of preparation for the World Cup as to make a mark in Spain, the NBBF decided it needed a coach who will spend more time in camp preparing the team. In a face book post yesterday, Vincent who led the D’tigress to the Afrobasket title last year in Mali said it was a pleasure coaching the team and expressing hope that they will replicate their title-winning performance at in Spain. “Wow, big thanks to all of the family, friends, officials, Nigerian supporters and colleagues that reached out to express their support.  I am fine and feel blessed and grateful for the time I spent with Nigeria.  The basketball memories and friendships are truly Fantastic! “Any competitive head coach would be sore about missing the opportunity to extend on a undefeated 8-0 team record.  Chemistry, commitment, execution and many other special factors are needed for undefeated teams and that doesn’t always happen.  Maybe nobody could beat us! I’ll never know. “But it’s time to move on.  Please support and encourage the women of the Nigeria National Basketball Team.   They are a wonderful group of ladies and I wish them nothing but the best during the 2018 World Cup in Spain,” the coach added. He has since been replaced by his compatriot, Otis Hughley has since submitted his programme to the NBBF.
