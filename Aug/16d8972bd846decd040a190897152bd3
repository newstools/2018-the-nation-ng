An Ilorin-based legal practitioner, Mr Kolawole Usman, has advised parents and guardians to teach their children and wards morals, to enable them to become responsible citizens in the society. Usman gave the advice on Thursday in an interview in Ilorin. According to him, most parents expect school teachers to instill morals in their children, thus exposing them to cultivate bad behavior from their peers in school. He urged parents to give their children and wards moral discipline at home, and allow their teachers to improve on such foundation while in school. Usman blamed the moral decadence in the society on the failure of parents to properly bring up their children, leaving such responsibility solely to the teachers. According to him, charity begins at home. So, parents has a lot to do in the life of their children. “Parents are expected to be the best teachers, as everything starts under their supervision right from home. “Teach your children how to dress decently, how to eat and how to approach people they come across. “Teach them manner and how to respect their elders, as required in our rich African culture. “Everything starts with you as a parent. It is expected of you to understand your children better than any teacher. “Try and guide your children right and stop relying on teachers to shape their lives for you. “Mind you, teachers are not robots that can do everything; start first, and let them complete the task for you,” he advised. The lawyer, however, urged parents to be an exemplary role model to their children by behaving well.
