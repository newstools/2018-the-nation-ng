Tianjin Teda’s German coach Uli Stielike has dismissed any chance of John Mikel Obi leaving before the expiration of his contract at the end of this season, but he admitted that the former Chelsea midfielder lost his place in his Tianjin-based side’s starting line-up after recovering from a knee injury. Though the German ex-international rubbished speculation linking Mikel with a transfer from the Chinese Super League club this summer Stielike admitted that the Eagles’ star’s chances of starting matches this season depends on the club’s new Brazilian star Jonathan. Stielike stated: “I don’t know about this news, and I am not interested. We only want to focus on this year’s league. As for whether Mikel will play, it depends on whether Jonathan can recover.” Stielike has also been constrained by CLS rules on foreign player quotas for each match, such that he picked Ghana’s Acheampong and German ace, Bastians alongside Jonathan as the three foreigners in the squad. That decision left Mikel out, only for the Eagles star, who did not feature in six matches since the Chinese Super League resumed after the World Cup, to return for last Saturday’s match against Jiangsu Suning.
