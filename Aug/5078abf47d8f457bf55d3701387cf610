Jose Mourinho says his Manchester Unitedsquad “is the same” as last season following a frustrating transfer window for the club. “It is the same, the same squad as last season,” Mourinho told Sky Sports. “We changed the goalkeepers with Lee [Grant] because Joel [Pereira] Is such a good young goalkeeper that he needs to play. “We changed Daley Blind for a 19-year-old kid [Diego Dalot] that we believe has the potential to play right-back or left-back and we changed Michael Carrick for Fred so our squad is the same. “He [Fred] is a midfield player, he’s not a striker, not a central defender, he’s a midfield player that technically is very good. In that sense, typically, the Brazilian player has a very rich luggage in technical terms and also in some static beauty movements of football. He’s a player to really enjoy, if he adapts as soon as possible.”
