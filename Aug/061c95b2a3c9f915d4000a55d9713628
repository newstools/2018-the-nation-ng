Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr will arrive in Abuja next week to commence preparations for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying match away to Seychelles on September 7. The Franco-German tactician has not been in Nigeria since the Eagles participated in the Russia 2018 World Cup and has been actively involved in FIFA organized seminars and meetings. He has now confirmed that he would be in Nigeria next week and would likely release his team list for the Seychelles match next Friday. Rohr disclosed that he has been travelling around Europe to monitor young Nigerian players doing well for their various clubs during the pre-season and the league proper. He also told NationSport that he would be in France this weekend to watch enterprising 20 year old winger  Samuel Kalu playing his first match for his new club Bordeaux after joining the club from Gent of Belgium. Former Gent of Belgium winger Samuel Kalu recently joined Bordeaux of France to replace Malcolm who moved to Barcelona. “I will be in Nigeria next week. We will announce our list for Seychelles when I arrive. This week end I will watch the first appearance of (Samuel) Kalu with Bordeaux,” Rohr noted.
