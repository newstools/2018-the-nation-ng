A 40-year-old visually-impaired man, Rotimi Sowemimo, has called on Nigerians to help him gain admission into the Pacelli School for the Blind, Oshodi, Lagos. Sowemimo told The Nation that he would fend for himself if educated. “I want to go to school. I want to be able to use my hands well. I believe I can be useful to myself and the society. That is why I am pleading with Nigerians to assist me to go to school,” he said. Sowemimo, who lives at 13 Shittu Street, Idi-Araba, Mushin, is also seeking assistance to regain his sight. His predicament, he said, started in 1997 when he began feeling uncomfortable with his eyes.  He assumed it was conjunctivitis (Apolo).  He went to the Isolo General Hospital after one month and he was referred to Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LASU) where he was giving an eye glass. Sowemimo said: “The doctor did not tell me anything. He just recommended an eye glass to me and told me to come for check-up after some months.  When I eventually went for the check-up, I met another who attended to me. He was shocked that the previous doctor did not run any test on me before recommending an eye glass. He then did a check-up on my eyes and told me to do some tests. The result of the tests confirmed that my left eye has been damaged. He then referred me to Eye Foundation Hospital, Ikeja”. Sowemimo said he had done four surgeries and is still unable to use his eyes.  He is appealing to the public to help him regain his sight. His account details are:  Guaranty Trust Bank (GTB), 0014440305. He can be reached on 08091823418.
