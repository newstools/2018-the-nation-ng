Acting President Yemi Osinbajo on Wednesday presided over the weekly Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting with many ministers in attendance. The meeting started one hour before the usual 11:00 a.m. commencement time. In the past, many cabinet members found reasons to stay away from such meetings when President Muhammadu Buhari was out of the country. But the story was different on Wednesday with at least 23 ministers present in the Council Chamber when the meeting started at few minutes past 10:00 a.m. The Acting President had on Tuesday sacked the Director-General of Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Daura, over the unauthorized siege on the National Assembly.
