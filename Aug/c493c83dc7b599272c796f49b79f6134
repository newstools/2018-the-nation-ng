Thevron has announced a contribution of $500,000 from the Chevron Global Community Fund to the American Red Cross in support of relief efforts for California wildfires.
“These fires have had a severe impact on the lives of so many people, both residents and responders,” said Chevron Chairman and CEO, Michael Wirth. “Our thoughts are with all of them, and we know everyone is working very hard to prevent any further injuries or loss of life.”
Chevron places a high priority on supporting the communities where it operates. In 2017, the Chevron Global Community Fund donated a total of $1 million for California wildfire relief efforts, he added.
