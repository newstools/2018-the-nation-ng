Niger State Governor, Alhaji Abubakar Sani-Bello has said that he has no plan to defect from All Progressive Congress (APC) to any other political party. According to the Governor, there is no cause for apprehension in any quarters emphasizing that Niger state has remained predominantly an APC state and political affiliation in the state will continue to wax stronger. In a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary, Malam Jibrin Ndace, the governor maintained that he remained consistent in support of President Muhammadu Buhari-led government and committed to party ideals stating that APC remains the only political party to rescue Nigeria from the many wrongs of the past administrations. “In the last three years, we have shown commitment to the needs and aspirations of Nigerlites through restoration agenda predicated on agriculture, health, education, peace and security, youth and women empowerment and infrastructural development” “We demonstrated through completion of abandoned and uncompleted projects by past administration that government is about the people. It is on this account that i seek to renewed my mandate from Nigerlites.” He stated that President Buhari has and is doing well in terms of infrastructural development in the state and the country; while the state government is fulfilling the yearning and aspirations of the people, hence there was no justification to defect. ” President Muhammadu Buhari remains a stabilising factor in strengthening the nation’s unity. I and my colleagues have already set in motion a political strategy to lead a successful campaign for President Muhammadu Buhari’s re-election.“
