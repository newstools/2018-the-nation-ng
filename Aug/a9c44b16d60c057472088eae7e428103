Ahead of Osun governorship election, a civil society organisation, YIAGA AFRICA, has trained 31 long term observers to monitor the pre-election environment in the state. In a statement by its Executive Director, Samson Itodo, the group said the pre-election observation will help Yiaga Africa detect early warning signals which may affect the credibility of the process. According to the statement, the Osun State Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Olusegun Agbaje, witnessed the training for long term observers in the state. During the training in Osogbo, Agbaje expressed appreciation to Yiaga Africa for her collaborative role with the commission over the years as part of efforts towards building a true and lasting democracy in Nigeria. Meanwhile, YIAGA AFRICA has said timely receipt of the non sensitive materials by INEC would enhance its performance.
