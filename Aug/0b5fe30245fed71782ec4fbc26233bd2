The Kaduna State Police Command confirmed on Sunday that an abducted Islamic scholar, Malam Ahmad Garko, has regained his freedom. Garko was kidnapped alongside his two sons by unknown gunmen last week in Kaduna. The Command’s spokesman, Mukhtar Aliyu, said all the abducted persons have regained their freedom. Aliyu said two suspects were arrested in connection with the abduction, adding that the cleric was released due to the pressure mounted by security operatives. He said: “The two suspects are under investigation and we are on the trail of two other suspects. “No ransom was paid as far as I know. He was released unhurt and he has reunited with his family.” NAN
