…Lauds, PMB, Tinubu on direct primary   Oil magnate and entrepreneur, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has declared for the Ogun State governorship race, expressing the confidence that he would not only clinch the All Progressives Congress (APC) gubernatorial ticket, but also succeeds Governor Ibikunle Amosun on May 29, 2019. Abiodun who lauded President Muhammadu Buhari and APC national leader, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, for their position on direct primary as the right approach to select its candidates for electives offices, said he would focus on “mass centric” programmes and not “ones that cater for the elites or “have only visibility value,” if he emerges  as Governor in 2019. The APC chieftain and Real Estate investor, made this known to reporters in Iperu, his home town, Ogun State on Thursday evening while declaring his ambition to succeed Governor Amosun. He urged the Ogun State chapter of the APC to adopt direct primary system as the right approach for selecting governorship candidates, saying it remains the way to give party members the unfettered freedom to pick the right person from the pool of aspirants. According to him, the pronouncement of the party leaders like President Buhari and Tinubu – on direct primary as advocated by both, actually saves the party from further hemorrhage due to defection, since direct primary assured every party member equal chance of participation in the race in a fair and free level playing field, devoid of impositions. Abiodun assured that he has the intellectual capacity, experience, pedigree to govern the state and “raised the bar” because of veritable leadership and management skills garnered over the years from the private sector, adding that it would be “laughable” for anybody sit in a “corner of somewhere and appoints who should be Governor of Ogun State.”
