Proprietress of God’s Own Orphanage located along Siluko Road in Bénin City, Mrs. Kehinde Blessing Imariagbe, has been arrested by men of the Edo State Police Command over the discovery of a missing child in her orphanage. The child identified as Elo Ogidi was reportedly stolen from the Christ Embassy church in Oregun, Lagos State on Sunday, July 8, 2018. It was gathered that she was discovered at the orphanage in Edo through the help of a prophetess. Speaking to newsmen when she was paraded, Mrs. Imarhiagbe rained curses on the man that brought Elo to her. Imarhiagbe stated that the man claimed to be father to Elo which was why she did not report the matter to relevant authorities. She gave the name of the man that brought Elo as Patrick Chukwuma. According to her, “I have been calling Chukwuma since last week but his numbers could not be reached. “It was my mistake not to report to the matter because I felt since it was her father that brought her. We only report cases if the child could not be traced to anybody. “If it as an abandon child, we go to the police. The girl looked like the man that brought her which was why I believed.” Edo Police Commissioner, Babtunde Kokumo, said the stolen child was brought to the orphanage under questionable circumstances. He said the matter would soon be charged to court after investigation has been concluded.
