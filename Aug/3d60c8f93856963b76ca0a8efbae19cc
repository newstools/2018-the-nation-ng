Most transactions at the Nigerian equities market closed yesterday at higher prices but losses recorded by large-cap stocks overshadowed the overall market position. Benchmark indices at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) indicated average decline of 0.32 per cent, representing a net capital depreciation of N42 billion. With 26 gainers to 14 losers, most sectoral indices closed on the upside as investors sought to take advantage of low share prices across small and mid-cap stocks. However, profit-taking transactions of Dangote Cement, UAC of Nigeria and FBN Holdings depressed the overall market value.

Analysts remained cautious about the outlook for the equities market, with projections depending on the investment horizons. “In subsequent sessions, we expect a positive performance as investors position in bellwethers with attractive entry prices,” Afrinvest Securities stated. “In the interim, we expect sentiments to remain downbeat underpinned by continued apathy towards the market as the 2019 electoral cycle draws nearer amid sustained sells in emerging and frontier markets by offshore investors,” SCM Capital stated.
