It’s a period to have nice time with friends and relations. “I have been to this place on several occasions and I must confess, it is getting better over time,” he said. Medical practitioner Wole Smith described the beach breeze as good for health. “I was looking forward to the break so I can get a deserved rest from the stress of work. “Coming to the beach is perfect for me to appreciate nature and the environment. It’s so good for the soul,” he said. Meat seller Malam Abdul Musa described the season as good for business. “I have made good money at the beach. It’s a place to do business at a season like now,” he said through an interpreter. A worker at the beach, who pleaded not to be identified because he was not authorised to speak, said the beach had been attracting hundreds of fun-seekers daily. “The large turnout of people on this beach is a daily occurrence because the beach is clean and of high standard. “We intend to keep it this way, to maintain our standard and increase patronage,” the official said.
