A 69-year-old woman, Munirat Alao, and her son, Yusuf, were yesterday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly damaging a fence, valued at N81, 000. The accused are facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and wilful damage. The prosecution alleged that the accused conspired and damaged a fence of thirty blocks, property of one Akeem Oloyede. Sergeant Michael Unah told the court that the accused committed the offences on August 3 at 11.00 p.m. at Ajasa Command. Unah said the duo, who also allegedly stole 30 pieces of blocks, had been committing the offence since 2017. He said the accused wanted the complainant to use where the fence was built as a pathway but he refused. “The complainant rebuilt the fence each time and the accused always damaged it,” the prosecutor said. The duo pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate A. A. Fashola granted the accused N50, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. Fashola said the sureties must be gainfully employed with evidence of two years tax payment to the Lagos State Government and should have their addresses verified by the court. He said the sureties must also reside within the court’s jurisdiction. The case continues on September 3.
