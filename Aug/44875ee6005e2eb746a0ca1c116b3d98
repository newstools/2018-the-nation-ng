Mrs. Amanda Pam, the Secretary, Health and Human Service Secretariat, Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA), says one out of every two babies delivered in FCT is not exclusively breastfed. Pam disclosed this at a ‘Baby Show’ organised by the FCT Primary Health Care Board to commemorate the 2018 World Breastfeeding Week with the theme “Breastfeeding: Foundation of Life’’. The scribe identified this gap as a contributing factor to the rate of death and illnesses in the territory describing it as unacceptable. She however suggested that the only way to reduce this burden was to ensure that all women in FCT irrespective of where they live are often time provided with adequate information on affordable, effective and efficient nutritious meals for their babies. According to her, the answer to mortality rate is exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life, followed by introduction of complementary food at six months while continuing breastfeeding for up to two years and beyond. Pam, who identified breast milk as God’s made best food for babies, however urged men to support their wives to effectively breastfeed to enable the children benefit optimally. She further urged women to ensure early initiation of breastfeeding within 30 minutes after delivery. ‘Women breastfeed your babies within half an hour of delivery, breastfeed without adding water or any food nor drink in the first six months of life.’ ‘Breast milk provides all the nutrients that the baby needs for growth, development in the first six months of life.’ ‘It has no cost implication, it promotes bonding between mother and child and as well makes children intelligent, among other benefits,’Pam said.
