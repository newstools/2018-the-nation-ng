The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) yesterday assured motorists of free flow of traffic, despite the closure of the Third Mainland Bridge betweent today and Sunday. FRSC Lagos State Sector Commander Hyginus Omeje said 200 personnel had been deployed in the critical corridors to free traffic. Omeje said the corps was working with other law enforcement agencies to prevent gridlock on the road. “We have about 200 FRSC personnel joined with LASTMA, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the police. All efforts have been put in place to make sure there is free flow of traffic at various alternative routes for motorists. “The traffic officers have mapped out strategic and alternative routes where the personnel will be positioned to direct motorists accordingly and ensure their compliance with traffic rules,” he said. The FRSC chief said motorists coming from Lagos-Ibadan could use alternative routes to connect Ikorodu-Funso Williams, Western Avenue to Eko Bridge. “Other alternatives are from toll gate to Alapere-Ogudu, Iyana Oworo to Gbagada to Anthony then down to Ikorodu Road. “The rest is from Oshodi-Apapa Expressway to Orile to Eko Bridge or Ijora Olopa.” According to him, moving out of Lagos Island, motorists can make  their way to  Adeniji-Carter Bridge, Idumagbo down to Oyingbo, then to Herbert Macaulay to Ijora Olopa to Eko Bridge. LASTMA Chief Executive Officer Chris Olakpe said about 150 LASTMA officials had been drafted to ensure free movement of vehicles during the period. Olakpe said the operatives were stationed at various critical routes to monitor the movement of vehicles and give directions to them. “LASTMA is on top of the game and we are joining forces with other law enforcement agencies to handle the traffic, especially on Eko Bridge.
