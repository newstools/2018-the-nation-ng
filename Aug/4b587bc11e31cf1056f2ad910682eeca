The lawmaker representing Akoko-Edo Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, Peter Akpatason, has berated those who recently defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying they do not fit into the vision of the APC. Akpatason said the defectors would loose next year’s general elections, because “they left good people in the APC to join bad people”. The lawmaker, who spoke to reporters in Bénin City, the Edo State capital, said the defectors triumphed in the 2015 general elections because of the APC platform. Akpatason described the PDP as a dumping ground for those he termed waste products. He said: “For you to effect development, you need the good, the bad and the ugly. But, in the process of development, you begin to see the good from the bad and the ugly. “At some point, it becomes clear to some people that they do not fit into the system and that is what is happening now. They jumped ship to where they actually belong. Some people jumped ship some years ago, because they wanted to contest election and they were attracted by the APC platform, particularly the Buhari tsunami. The factors also include the dynamics of their local politics. Akpatason “The PDP is a dumping ground for waste products and not a beautiful bride. Somebody who defected four years ago and is defecting now is a waste product. They don’t have value to add to the system. People of value command respect and do not defect, but only political merchants who see political parties as a platform do.”
