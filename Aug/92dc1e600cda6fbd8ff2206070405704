Scores of Youths in the Southern district of Ondo State have adopted an engineer, Raphael Ademulegun as their candidate for the 2019 senatorial election in the state. At a news briefing in Akure, the state capital, the youths mainly from Ikale axis of Okitipupa local government lamented the alleged retrogression in the area due to poor representation particularly at the National Assembly. The chairman, Ikale Youth Organization (IYO) Ademola Akinrinlola who spoke with reporters said Ademulegun, the chairman of Odigbo local government in Ondo state is their sole candidate for the Ondo South Senatorial seat. He said they hinged their decision on the fact that the former council chief going by his antecedents and youthful disposition would elevate the district. The youth leader said irrespective of the political platform Ademulegun was to run for the election, they would support him for victory. IYO lamented that the Ondo South senatorial district had suffered a major setback due to bad leadership and errors in appointment. It said “Due to poor representation and appointment error by the executive, Ondo South has suffered a major setback in terms of development and infrastructure.” “We are in darkness for the past four years now and we have a senator, a minister and other elected and appointed representatives as if we have none. It is irritating that many of them are making move to return for the second term despite their present failures. “Just imagine our current Senator in Ondo south is also seeking re-election despite his obvious failures in governance. He has been in the Senate since over three years as if the Ondo South senatorial seat is vacant”. The aggrieved youths maintained that they would go out to all the local governments and wards in the district to mobilize support for Ademulegun.
