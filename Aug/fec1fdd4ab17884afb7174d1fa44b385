An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded a teacher, Afeez Balogun, 27, in prison following his arraignment for allegedly defiling a two-year-old pupil. Chief Magistrate P. E. Nwaka remanded the accused in Kirikiri Prison pending advice from the Lagos State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Police prosecutor Christopher John said Balogun committed the offence last month at the premises of Holbrook Creche Nursery and Primary School, Gbagada, Lagos. John said the accused invited the minor to one of the empty classrooms during school hours and assaulted her. “Balogun, thereafter, inserted his sex organ in the private parts of the girl and defiled her, ignoring her cry and shout. “It was the accused’s co-teacher who was passing that caught him in the act and the case was reported to the owner of the school. The case was later reported at the police station,” John said. The case continues on August 30.
