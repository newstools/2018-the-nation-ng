Twenty-three members of the 24-member Kwara House of Assemblyyesterday defected to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Speaker Ali Ahmad announced this as conveyed in a letter by Majority Leader Hassan Oyeleke. Only one member Saheed Popoola, representing Ojomu-Balogun Constituency in Offa Local Government Area, did not defect. Ahmad said that the movement to the PDP by the 23 lawmakers became imperative “since the APC has failed to meet the aspirations of Nigerians”. He alleged that the APC-led Federal Government was harassing and intimidating top government functionaries instead of tackling the problem confronting the nation. “In 2014, l was terribly sad leaving PDP reluctantly with 36 members of the then House of the Representatives. Today, l am the happiest man leaving APC for good. “l wish l was never a member of that party,’’ the speaker said. The speaker announced the removal of Popoola as Chairman, House Committee on information, Youth and Sports. The members replace Popoola with Abdulrahman Abdulrafiu, representing llorin North West constituency.
