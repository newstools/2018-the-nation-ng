The prosecutor, Insp Johnson Okunade, told the Court that the defendants committed the offence on August 5 in Ado-Ekiti.

The offences contravened Section 4 (i) of the Secret Cult Code and Section 3 (i) of the Robbery and Firearms Act, 2012. The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges, while their counsel, Mr Chris Omokhafe, urged the Court to grant them bail, promising that they would not jump bail.

He adjourned the case until September 19 for mention.
