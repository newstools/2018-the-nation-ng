An Ado-Ekiti Magistrates’ Court has ordered the remand of a farmer, Toyin Ajakaye, for alleged murder and ‘secret burial’ of a commercial motorcyclist, Omoniyi Are. Toyin was alleged to have committed the crime on August 22 at Agbado-Ekiti in Gbonyin Local Government Area. Toyin told the court he engaged the Okada rider to take  him to the farm where a fight allegedly ensued between them following disagreement on the fare. The fight, according to him, was sparked by his offer to pay the deceased N100 of the N200 he charged. Toyin claimed he held the deceased by the neck as he (Are) was trying to grab his genitals, adding that the deceased died in the scuffle. The defendant confessed that when he couldn’t carry the body, he dug a shallow grave and tied a rope on the neck of the deceased and buried him. Toyin said he was apprehended by passers-by who handed him over to the police. But the report of the Investigating Police Officer (IPO), Lasisi Bashiru, countered the statement of the defendant. According to the IPO, investigation showed the defendant tied the rope on the neck of the deceased on the scene of the crime and buried the body. He added that Toyin had been detained for stealing goats. The police prosecutor, Oriyomi Akinwale, pleaded that the court should grant the request to remand the defendant in prison custody. Defence counsel, Busuyi Ayorinde, asked that the duplicate case file be forwarded to the Ministry of Justice for legal advice, adding that application for bail will be filed before an appropriate court. Magistrate Modupe Afeniforo ordered that Toyin be remanded in prison custody, and adjourned the case till 16.
