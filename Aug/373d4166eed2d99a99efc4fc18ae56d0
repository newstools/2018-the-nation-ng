NationSport can reveal today that Super Eagles’ assistant coach Salisu Yusuf has been dropped from the team’s technical crew slated to prosecute the September 7 cracker against Seychelles in Victoria, due to his inglorious role of in the $700 bribery scandal which happened last year during the CHAN tournament held in Ghana. Revealing this to NationSport on Friday in Lagos, Eagles’ manager Gernot Rohr lamented the situation where Sanusi was captured on camera collecting $700 from an undercover reporter to field two players who were regulars in his other age-grade squad, although they were not in Ghana. Rohr regrets the setting where Salisu accepted the cash stressing that: ” I have worked with Salisu for close to two years and I trust him. But he won’t be with us in Victoria for Seychelles’ game because there is a FIFA inquest on the matter and the NFF has inaugurated a panel to probe what transpired in the unfortunate incident. ”Salisu is a victim of circumstance. He fell for a trap. He was naive. But he is an honest person. A good coach but he is out of the Seychelles trip due to what has happened,” Rohr said.
