The Chief Executive Officer of Discomfort Creative Agency, Hertz K. Fauzan, last Friday threw up a cocktail party for 100 CEOs and entrepreneurs. The event, tagged: ‘Industry Meet for CEOs and Entrepreneurs’, took place at Westwood Hotel, Ikoyi, Lagos, aimed to network, mingle and share business ideas. The host of the night, Hertz Fauzan, while addressing the audience reinforced the need for a vision. “Some businesses collapse because they don’t have a clear vision,” he said. “Sometimes clients have a dream but they don’t have a map, sometimes they have a map but don’t know how to execute it.” Speaking about the initiative, the Director of Communications and Strategy, Kingsley Iweka, said the aim of the event was to connect, network and enhance business relationships within entrepreneurs. Iweka said the event is “also to unlock innovation potential through collaboration and resource sharing because, the primary goal of every entrepreneur is to make more money and stay above their competitors.” Among those present at the event was the CEO of Cyrus45 Factory, Banjo Olabanko who recycles tyres to produce bespoke furniture.
