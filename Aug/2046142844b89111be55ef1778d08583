It was excitement and fun for kids at the Cycling Lagos children Race as organisers took time to groom and inspire children who may represent Nigeria in future international cycling events and for a healthy lifestyle. The Children’s edition of the Cycling event was held on Saturday, August 18, 2018, at the Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere for kids between 13-18 years old, during which prizes were won. Speaking at the event in Lagos, Chairman Cycling Lagos, Mr Soji Adeleye said the event was necessary to create cycling culture among the kids and prepare them for future events on the World Stage. “Aside from promoting cycling culture among the children at an early stage, the Cycling Lagos Children Race is aimed at grooming children who would grow up to represent Nigeria at international cycling events,” he said. The Minister of Transportation, Mr Rotimi Amaechi has promised to join other leaders and cycling enthusiasts in the Celebrity Race at the grand finale of the highly anticipated Cycling Lagos 2018 scheduled for August 25th.
