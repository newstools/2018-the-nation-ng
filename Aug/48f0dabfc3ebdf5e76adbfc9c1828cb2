After initially being prevented from entering the National Assembly complex, some senators have been allowed in by security agents. Operatives of the Department of State Security had earlier turned back the senators claiming to be acting on orders from above. Among those allowed in were Senators Rafiu Ibrahim, Mrs Abiodun Olujimi, Ordia Clifford, Peter Nwaboche,  Ben Bruce, Ahmed Ogembe  and Isa Misau. The Senators who are sitting in front of the chamber decried the blockade and warned against any illegal action to impeach principal officers of the Senate.  More details soon.
