The total loans granted by Nigerian banks to the private sector declined from N16 trillion in the first quarter of 2017 to N15.34 trillion in the second quarter of 2018, a difference of N600.60 billion. A report by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Selected Banking Sector Data: Sectorial Breakdown of Credit, ePayment Channels and Staff Strength (Q2 2018), revealed that credit to the private sector declined for six consecutive quarters. A breakdown of the total N63.27 trillion credit provided in 2017 by banks to finance activities of the private sector shows that N16 trillion was provided in the first quarter. The second, third and fourth quarters had N15.7 trillion, N15.83 trillion and N15.74 trillion, respectively. According to the report, banks lent N15.6 trillion to the private sector in Q1 2018, while the total value of credit allocated by banks stood at N15.34 trillion as at Q2 2018. Credit allocation to the Oil & Gas sector increased to N3.45 trillion in Q2 from N3.42 trillion in Q1 2018, while finance to the Manufacturing sector dropped to N2.02 trillion from N2.07 trillion in Q1. The money lent to the agriculture sector increased to N523.08 billion from N501.6 billion recorded in Q1, Power and Energy dropped to N416.34 billion from N426.5 billion while Mining and quarry also declined to N10.18 billion from N10. 461 billion in Q1.

The Education sector received N71.8 billion, while Transportation and Storage and other Sectors received N304.4 billion and N361.7 billion, respectively. Dr Frank Jacobs, President, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), said the Deposit Money Banks (DMB) had consistently showed unease to lend to the real sector of the economy. “One of the greatest challenges facing the manufacturing sector in the country is lack of long-term financing and high interest rate. “It is quite disturbing to us that the banks are not lending as much as we need because that is the only way to grow the economy,” he said. Jacobs said the association would continue to engage the banks to bridge the funding gaps. He commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for its plan to implement a special regime to make funds available to the manufacturing and agriculture sectors at nine per cent interest. However, Jacobs reiterated that to spur economic growth, recovery and industrialisation, funds should be made available to the real sector at five per cent. Director-General Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) Muda Yusuf said more funds should be allocated to the private sector to enhance productivity, employment and economic growth. “If lending is declining, it shows that there is a lot more work to be done. Some of the issues affecting private sector lending need to be revisited. “When the economic environment is not too conducive, the risk of lending to the private sector increases,” he said.
