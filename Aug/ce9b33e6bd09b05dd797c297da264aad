The Ugandan lawmaker whose treason charge was withdrawn by the Military, has been re-arrested and again charged with treason, the state broadcaster reported on Thursday. Robert Kyagulanyi appeared before a military court on Thursday to face charges of unlawful weapons possession. The court ordered those charges dropped, but he was then taken into civilian custody on new treason charges, UBC TV reported. Kyagulanyi, a musician-turned-lawmaker who goes by the stage name Bobi Wine, and four other lawmakers were arrested on August 13 on suspicion of involvement in the stoning of a presidential convoy during a parliamentary by-election campaign.
