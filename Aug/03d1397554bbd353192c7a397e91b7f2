The security situation at the national Assembly deteriorated on Tuesday morning after the Clerk of the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani Omolori, was denied entry into the complex. Omolori made it to the last gate of the Assembly complex before he was stopped by  security operatives. After discovering that the security operatives were under strict instructions, the  NASS clerk put a call through to someone who said he could go into the complex. “How can I go in when my staff are not allowed in? Who am I going to work with?,” he asked the person at the other end. After several minutes of muted conversation, the returned to his car. Before entering his vehicle, he spoke with the chairman of the National Assembly staff union, and asked him to calm down the workers.
