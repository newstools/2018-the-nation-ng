Former Governors Rabiu Kwankwaso, Lucky Igbinedion, Idris Wada and Celestine Omehia yesterday led prominent Nigerians to celebrate ex-Rivers State Governor Peter Odili at 70, at a lecture in Port Harcour, Rivers State. Also present are ex-Court of Appeal President Justice Umaru (rtd), former Akwa Ibom State Military Governor Col Bako, senators, traditional rulers, and others. Governor Nyesom Wike and others hailed Odili for investing his intellect and resources in building the country. In lecture: “Sir Dr Peter Odili: Defender of the Faith, Defender of the Fatherland”, former Attorney-General of the Federation Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN) said Odili was an ornament of Rivers State. He said: “Formerly, he belonged to Rivers State.  He has ceased to be the property of Rivers State.  He is now the property of Nigeria and the world “. Agabi noted that Odili is an outstanding humanist, who is courageous and committed to the growth of the country. He said: “Whatever he has done is for the benefit of mankind. Whatever he has refrained from doing , it is in the interest of society “. He called for the unity of the country where Nigerians can work anywhere, irrespective of state of origin. Agabi called for a National Integration Centre. Agabi praised Justice Mary Odili for supporting her husband to do exploits and be  a blessing to generations. Publicity Secretary of Afenifere Yinka Odumakin said at 70, Odili and other men of goodwill should  stand and work for revival of the country. He said: “Except all men of goodwill should stand up to be counted.  We may witness a major cataclysm in this country. “ Odumakin noted that the country has lost track and will descend into dictatorship and anarchy unless  Nigerians check the slide. Odili thanked God for His mercy and  enabling  him with the capacity to transform the society. He commended  Wike for organising the programme to celebrate him.
