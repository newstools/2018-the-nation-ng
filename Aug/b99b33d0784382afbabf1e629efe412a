SONOROUS songstress, Simi, has described  her performance on same stage with Afrojazz genius, Lagbaja, as a milestone in her music career. Both artistes had performed at the Abuja version of Johnnie, Jazz & Whisky (JJW), where they thrilled fans to the best of their songs and stagecraft. She described Lagbaja as a legend, and their performance together as time of her life. “So yesterday I met a LEGEND!!! I had the time of my life #JJW #LivingMyDreams #GodisGood  – @officiallagbaja,” she wrote on IG.Lagbaja in his response called her an angel: “How many of you got to see this beautiful mashup with the lovely @symplysimi? She’s an angel,” he stated. Simi’s disposition may have stemmed from the larger-than-life image the Afrojazz maestro evokes in the African music scene and beyond. Simi was just five years old when Lagbaja released his first album,‘Ikira’ in 1993 and had not started recording professionally, when Lagbaja clinched the Channel O Music Video Award for ‘Never Far Away’, the song the duo re-enacted with their performance at the JJW concert. The post which has garnered over 50, 000 likes and 1, 260 comments at the time of this report, highlighted more ecstatic fans who are joyful for the singer, while requesting for a collaboration from the duo. JJW is the premier platform for live performances sponsored by Johnnie Walker Black Label. The last session was held in Abuja on Saturday, July 28, 2018, at the Central Park.
