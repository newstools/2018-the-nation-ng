â€¢Hoodlums abduct expatriate Gunmen have killed three persons and abducted another around Woji community in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State. The victims are said to be two policemen and a driver in the convoy of a foreigner, who was also abducted by the bandits. Eyewitnesses said the kidnappers ambushed the convoy on Akom Road, shot and killed the policemen and the driver. A resident Rachel Reginald said the gunmen abducted the foreigner after the shooting at 9.47 p.m on Wednesday. This happened barely 12 days after two soldiers, a policeman and a driver were killed in Abua Local Government Area while attempting to foil the abduction of an expatriate. But their target escaped. Reginald said two passers-by sustained bullet wounds in the shooting, which lasted about 15 minutes. Police spokesman Nnamdi Omoni, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), confirmed the death of the two policemen. He said another victim was recuperating in hospital. The spokesman denied any abduction. Omoni regretted that the hoodlums carried out a surprise attack on the police team. He said the command had intensified the search for the perpetrators to bring them to justice.
