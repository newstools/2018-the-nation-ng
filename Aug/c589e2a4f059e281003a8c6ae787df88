A former Minister of Transport, Yusuf Suleiman, explained his defection ‎to the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Wednesday, saying it was a voluntary and unconditional decision to dump the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He described the PDP as a wrong party. Suleiman said: “I was in the wrong company of those who do not understand the ideals and concept of party politics and democracy‎. “As a patriotic Nigerian, I feel that I owe Nigerians the duty to demonstrate same and the need to join the journey‎ of helping Mr. President and Sokoto State to develop the nation.” Speaking to journalists ‎shortly after he was registered as APC member, Suleiman who was also a former Minister of Youth and Sports, said he would improve the popularity and vision of the party.
