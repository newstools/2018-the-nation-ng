Victor Moses is looking forward to a successful season under Maurizio Sarri despite the cloud of uncertainty in securing a starting shirt under the new Chelsea manager. Moses was one of the players that was handed a regular spot under former manager Antonio Conte, but the Nigerian international is not sure of pinning down a shirt under Sarri. The Italian boss has been tasked with steering Chelsea FC back into the top four at the very least after they finished in fifth place and won the FA Cup under Conte last term. Speaking in an interview with Chelsea FC’s website, Moses said: “We’re looking forward to it. “Obviously we have a new manager now, he’s got a new philosophy and we’re looking good in training. We just want to work hard together as a team and make sure we understand what he wants from us and do the best we can this season. “Chelsea is a big club. It’s a club with a great history, we’ve won loads of big trophies, and we always want to do that. “With the players we’ve got and ability that we’ve got, we just want to keep on working hard together to make the club great and keep doing well.” The west London side is getting to grips with life under their new boss after he was drafted in as Antonio Conte’s successor at Stamford Bridge last month. Recall that Sarri’s Chelsea FC side were beaten 2-0 in the Community Shield by Premier League champions Manchester City on Sunday afternoon at the Wembley stadium as they struggled against Pep Guardiola’s side. And the Nigerian duo of Victor Moses and Tammy Abraham both started on the substitute bench for the West London side.
