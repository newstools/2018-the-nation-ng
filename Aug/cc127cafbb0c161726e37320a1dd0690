Speaking later when he visited the scene of the incident, the governor said a joint team comprising men of the Operation Clean and Healthy Anambra (OCHA) brigade, the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) and the State Ministry of Works would join in the search. He also directed the Ministry of Works to redesign the road and create appropriate water channels to forestall a recurrence of such incidents.
