Serena Williams is determined to keep chasing Grand Slam titles for as long as she can, and is prepared to be on the court when her daughter turns one during the US Open. The 23-time Grand Slam winner opened up about her prospects for the future, and how she mixes her career with motherhood, in a new interview on Today, on Wednesday morning. She said she’s had an ‘amazing year’ raising her 11-month-old daughter Olympia, whom she welcomed last year with her husband Alexis Ohanian, 35, all while returning to the courts. ‘Having the baby and coming back… It’s so special to have Olympia turning one soon,’ she told NBC News correspondent Stephanie Ruhle. ‘Maybe I’ll be playing on that day and I’ll just have those memories of being in the hospital and giving birth to my daughter.’ Serena explained how she kept her head in the game even during her hiatus, making it clear she was always intent on competing again. ‘I was always there mentally. I was always watching and being a part of it,’ she said. ‘And I never wanted to hang up my racket at that point. I’m still trying to compete and win Grand Slams and most of all, do it while I have a daughter.’ While the champion is due to start competing next week in the US Open, she’s already seeing beyond that tournament. ‘This is the beginning of a new career for me,’ she said. ‘I’m not going to be gone after the Open. I’m going to be in the next Grand Slam and the next and the next and the next and the next. It’s just going to keep going.’ Meanwhile, Serena Williams is feeling like a true queen ahead of the US Open. She’s taken over the streets of New York, spreading the word: The queen has arrived. At the West Side Tennis Club in Queens, the 23-time Grand Slam champ hosted a group of young queens with the designer behind her collaboration with Nike and Off-white, Virgil Abloh.
