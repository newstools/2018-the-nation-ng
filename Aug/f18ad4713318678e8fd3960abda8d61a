Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr have confirmed they have signed Nigeria World Cup star Ahmed Musa on a four-year contract from Premier League side Leicester City. It is believed to be one of the biggest transfers involving a Nigeria player as unconfirmed media reports suggest it could have cost Al Nassr more than 20 million pounds, which was what Chinese club Changchun Yatai splashed out for Odion Ighalo in January 2017. Musa, 25, was the shining star for the Super Eagles at the World Cup in Russia, where he scored twice for Nigeria to beat Iceland in a group game. He has now scored a total of four goals at the World Cup. However, the jet-heeled forward has struggled to establish himself at Leicester City after he joined them in 2016. He was loaned out to former club CSKA Moscow last season for him to enjoy more first-team football after he was cast away by the English club.
