A 24-year-old computer engineer, Ayodeji Folarin, was yesterday arraigned at an Ikeja High Court for allegedly impersonating a popular gospel artiste, Lara George, and defrauding three Americans of $8,500. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Folarin is facing a four-count charge of obtaining money by false pretences and possession of documents containing false pretence. The charges were prefered against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The defendant of 2, Folarin Street, Obada Oko in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting counsel Temitope Banjo said the defendant defrauded the foreigners between January and December 2016 in Ikeja, Lagos. “While posing as Lara George and with the intent to defraud, he obtained $8,500 from Trevor Dawe, Rick Cuewo and Stephen Wilson who are all citizens of the United States of America. “On June 2018, Folarin had in his possession, a World Lottery Organisation Winning Certificate and Affidavit of Common Law Marriage which all contained false pretenses. “The defendant also had in his possession emails containing false pretenses,” Banjo said. Following Folarin’s plea, his defence counsel, Mr Samuel Shodipo, requested that bail be granted to the defendant in the most liberal terms. The vacation judge, Justice Obafemi Adamson, ordered that the defendant be remanded in Ikoyi Prisons.
