Nickelson, the five-time major champion, tweeted for the first time on Wednesday morning. His first tweet couldn’t have been better: An excited Phil included a GIF of his double wink. I got this @Twitter thing down pic.twitter.com/gUx8XjNrez — Phil Mickelson (@PhilMickelson) August 22, 2018 Not long after tweet No. 1, Mickelson added another. I am about to tee off in the Pro-Am for the Northern Trust. Excited to start and excited to Tweet! — Phil Mickelson (@PhilMickelson) August 22, 2018 Phil’s bio: “Husband. Father. Golfer. Lefty.” Mickelson is not only looking for a strong FedEx Cup Playoffs run, but he’s also trying to earn a spot on the Ryder Cup team. The eight automatic spots are set, so U.S. captain Jim Furyk has four captain’s picks to make. Mickelson was No. 10 in the final Ryder Cup standings. He has a long history at the Ryder Cup. Mickelson has played in the last 11 Ryder Cups, going back to 1995. With Phil officially joining Twitter, the golf world started having some fun.
