Three days to the end of August, the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) has already generated N118billion -the highest revenue monthly collection ever, it was learnt Wednesday. The Nation gathered from the Public Relations Officer, Mr. Joseph Attah in Abuja that the Comptroller-General of Customs, Col. Hameed Ibrahim Ali (Rtd) made the disclosure in Abuja yesterday. The Customs PRO, who was quoting the Customs boss, said that “this month, the service has generated the highest ever monthly collection. It is still three days to the end of the month. And he announced a collection of N118 billion.” Attah based the impressive collection on the upgrade of the electronic platform from Nigeria Customs Information System (NISES), stressing that “system has now effectively blocked all the leakages that were associated with the former platform. It now monitors every Kobo being collected in the system.” The spokesman added that the no nonsense stance of the Comptroller-General was also accountable for the hugest monthly collection. The implementation of NISES, he said, is now giving rise to increase in revenue collection and increased contribution to the national treasury. He noted that the collection will assist the government to meet its promises to the citizenry in terms of infrastructure development in the face of dwindling oil revenue. Asked whether the implementation of the National Automative Policy has improved the industry or worsened it, Attah said that being a government policy, the NCS is bound to implement it. Continuing, he said that “ours is to implement. But then if you go to the streets, you will know how many cars have been assembled indigenously, and what local value content was brought into it.”
