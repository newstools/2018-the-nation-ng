Fifty persons were yesterday arraigned before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly vandalising a caterpillar belonging to the Lagos Government around Idansan village in Ibeju-Lekki. The suspects were arrested on Tuesday. They are facing a four-count charge of arson. Chief Magistrate Bola Osunsanmi remanded them in prison and referred the case to the Director, Public Prosecution (DPP) for advice. In a statement, Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task force) Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said the suspects attacked some Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA) official while demolishing shanties erected on acquired land. The officials, he said, were attacked with stones, iron-rods, broken bottles and burnt tyres. They were rescued by the agency’s enforcement team. According to him, owners/occupiers of the shanties were served notices and given months to evacuate their belongings from the land, which was approved for Dangote Refinery.
