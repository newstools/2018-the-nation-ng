Two Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) members in Osun State have filed a suit at an Osogbo High Court challenging the candidacy of Senator Ademola Adeleke as the party’s standard bearer in the September 22 governorship election. The suit, filed on Monday by Mr Oyetunji Suredi and Mr Olagboye Adedamola, is coming on the heels of Justice David Oladimeji’s judgment which dismissed a similar suit against Adeleke. The suit dismissed by Justice Oladimeji was filed by Rasheed Olabayo and Oluwaseun Idowu. In the fresh suit, the plaintiffs are seeking an interlocutory injunction restraining Adeleke from parading himself as the candidate of Osun State PDP over alleged school certificate forgery. They are also asking the court to make an order to restrain the state’s party Chairman, Mr Soji Adagunodo, and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from further recognising the defendant as the candidate of the party. The duo are further seeking an order mandating Adagunodo and INEC to replace Adeleke’s name with that of Akin Ogunbiyi, the runner-up in the party’s primary. The plaintiffs alleged that Adeleke had presented a forged document as part of the purported proof of his academic qualifications. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that no date has been fixed for the hearing.
