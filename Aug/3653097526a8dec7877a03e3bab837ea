Members of Kaiama community in Kaiama Local Government Area, Kwara State have staged a solidarity rally in support of President Muhammadu Buhari’s 2019 re-election bid. The community members who staged the rally included the elders, members of the All Progressives Congress (APC), youths and other interest groups. The rally, which was put together by a group known as Kaiama Progressive Movement (KPM), lasted about three hours, with the people openly denouncing Senate President Bukola Saraki. Before the rally around Kaiama, headquarters of the local government, the community had held a general meeting at the local government’s secretariat where they resolved to reject alleged political domination of the area by the Saraki dynasty. In a communique issued at the end of the meeting, signed by Sadiq Omar, Alhaji Musa Atinga, Saifudeen Aliyu and Alhaji Bagidi Alhasan, said “Kaiama stands with Buhari in 2019 as they have always done since 2003.” The communique reads: “Kaiama community will no longer tolerate political manipulation from Saraki and a few so-called Kaiama stakeholders for selfish reasons. “Kaiama will no longer tolerate the heartless deceit and neglect of her development, particularly infrastructure, health and education. “Kaiama community, having considered all her interest, has decided not only to stand with Buhari but to also support APC at all levels in the 2019 elections. “Any attempt to manipulate or intimidate our community in the 2019 elections will be met with stiff coordinated resistance.”
