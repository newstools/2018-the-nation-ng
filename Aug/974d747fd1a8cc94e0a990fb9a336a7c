Nigeria international defender Kenneth Omeruo has arrived in Turkey for transfer talks with interested teams after failing to impress new coach of Chelsea Maurizo Sarri despite his starring role for Nigeria at the World Cup in Russia. Omeruo was widely hailed as one of the best defenders for Nigeria at the World Cup but Sarri still doesnâ€™t see the Nigerian as part of his plans for the new season, and the defender is set for another spell away from the club. A move to Turkey, where he has spent the last three seasons on loan, looked like the surest possibility for mow with rumours linking him with a permanent move to Goztepe after impressing at Kasimpasa last season. He arrived Turkey last night for talks with not just Goztepe but two other unnamed teams who are also on his trail as he seeks a permanent move away from Chelsea, where he has failed to make the step up to the main team since joining in 2013. 24-year-old Omeruo has in the past turned out for Dutch side ADO Den Haag and Turkish side Alanyaspor with two loan spells at Middlesbrough and Kasimpasa among the five seasons he has played on loan away from Chelsea.
