Lagos State Government has given 21–day ultimatum to owners of bonded terminals in Ajegunle in Ajeromi-Ifelodun area to vacate their current locations. Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development Prince Rotimi Ogunleye also gave owners of the trailers parked on various streets in Ajegunle and Olodi-Apapa to vacate the streets within 48 hours. He said the bonded terminals are located in the areas designated for residential, saying their operations are in conflict with the state’s Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law. He said the illegal citing of the terminals had disrupted the socio-economic activities of Ajegunle and environs. Ogunleye in company of the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Security, Yinka Akinrinde had earlier met the owners of the terminals in the office of Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgal at the State Police Command, Ikeja. Companies affected by the deadline include Don Climax Bonded Terminals which has three of the sealed site and Queena Bonded Terminals.
