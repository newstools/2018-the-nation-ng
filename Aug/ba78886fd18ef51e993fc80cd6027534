A group, Buhari/Osibanjo Initiatives for Demonstrating Change in Nigeria has expressed satisfaction with the leadership ingenuity of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole describing him as God-sent to rescue the party from collapse for the reelection of President Muhammadu Buhari in 2019. In a statement issued in Abakaliki, the National Coordinator of the group, Comrade Chinedu Ogah noted that the National Working Committee of the party under the chairmanship of the former Edo state governor had brought sanity and rule of law to the party. He commended Oshiomhole for redeeming that image of APC which the group noted was in the precipice of destruction under the past leadership. Ogah stressed that the Open Direct Primaries proposed by the National chairman was apt, as it would bring power back to the people for the advancement of democracy both in the party and in the country. “I am particularly enthused with the leadership prowess of the national chairman of our party, Adams Oshiomhole. He has displayed enough expertise in party politics and that’s is why APC is gradually redeeming it’s image”. “He is a God-sent to APC to rescue it from collapse and destruction. We are proud of him. The open direct primaries which he is proposing will certainly distinguish our party as the most democratic party in the country, where power rests on the people”. “His ability to unite most of the members of the party in the National assembly shows that the fortunes of the party in bright in the face of present challenges, Ogah said. He called on members of the party to support Oshiomhole in his efforts to rebuild APC, assuring that all the skirmishes and internal wrangling which made some people defect to other political parties were been sorted out. The group further enjoined other members of APC in the country to add voices on the agitation for the resignation of the Senate president, Bukola Saraki from the position.
