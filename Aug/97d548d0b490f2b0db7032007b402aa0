There may be no fact in the news that Port-Harcourt-based hip hop artiste, Duncan Mighty, allegedly beat his wife to pulp, as is being speculated on the social media. Last week, pictures of a lady with a battered face tagged to be his wife circulated on the internet. The singer, in an Instagram post accompanied by pictures of himself and his wife and a video of his wife and baby, rubbished the wife-beating allegation. He also recalled how sections of the media have been following his life and seeking to destroy his family with fake news. “The next news will be that I used my wife for coming back, what do you gain to tarnish my image with lies that I brutalized my wife,” he started. “Hehehe, una come late.” He then recalled various instances where ‘fake news’ was written about him, even relating that he met a certain blogger who told him his lack of scandal is what has kept him unique. Duncan Mighty, the self-styled Port Harcourt King also warned bearers of fake news to leave him and his family alone. “I no come Lagos to find Fame,” he said. “For your information, my Marriage is not one of those you people broke down and will never be. For your info I am the winner of my marriage my wife and kids can’t do without Daddy every moment. The more you make people hate me the more they love me more.” He also used the opportunity to promo his latest single. “Please don’t allow these fools make you forget we dropping one of the biggest TUNE of our time AZA DAVIDO DUNCANMIGHTY PERUZI,” he wrote. “I LOVE MA FANS.”
