As a Best Actress nominee for Africa Movie Academy Award (AMAA) for her role in Kunle Afolayan’s ‘Roti’, popular actress, Kate Henshaw is excited, thanking the director and other crew members for an amazing time on set. “When @kunleafo approached me about the story “ROTI”, he said he wrote it with me in mind, I didn’t believe him… I thought he wanted a discount on my fees,” she said on Facebook. “Fast forward to last week Friday @amaawards_ nomination night and I found out I was a nominee.. “Totally unexpected… “Thank you @amaawards_ “Kunle pushed me and there were times I resented him!! E no send me…He wanted what he wanted. “@yinka.edward, one of the most gentle and focused cinematographers I know did an awesome job. “Uncle Pat Nebo did his usual magic with the set design.. “Kunle’s son Darisimire was a true actor…. “Jamiu, Segun and the rest of the crew were truly amazing… “This nomination is for us all… “Like Kunle would say ‘IRE'” ‘Roti’ which stars Kunle Afolayan playing alongside Kate Henshaw, Toyin Oshinaike, Fathia Balogun and his son, Dari Afolayan, the story is centered on how, years after a couple loses their son called Roti to a brief illness, the wife sees a boy called Juwon who is an exact replica of her dead son. After discovering that Juwon is not a reincarnation of Roti, she is washed anew by grief and soon descends into depression and consequent hysteria. The film is one of the three (‘Roti’, ‘Umogwo’ and ‘Tribunal’) last efforts of the filmmaker which were earlier planned as television series but later upgraded into films.
