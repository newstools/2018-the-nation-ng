Nigeria International, Wilfred Ndidi is thrilled to have committed his future to Leicester City moments after signing a new six-year deal with the Foxes. Ndidi told the club’s official website that negotiations for the new contract was very easy for him because he has enjoyed memorable moments since he joined Leicester from Genk in January 2017 in a £14m deal. “I’m very happy to sign this contract with Leicester City,” Ndidi said. “I have enjoyed every moment of my time with the football club, so I’m thrilled to be here for six more years. “Together with my team-mates and our wonderful supporters, I hope we can look forward to many more fantastic moments.” The Super Eagles’ star has played 63 times for the Foxes with the 21-year-old winning Leicester’s Young Player of the Year in each of the last two campaigns.
