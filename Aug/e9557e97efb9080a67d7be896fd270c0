He usually smiled to everyone he met, and this is one thing I envy about him.” His classmates visited the late Samson’s parents, describing his death as “monumental loss”. His classmate, who simply gave his name as Hammed, said: “I am still in shock, because I still had a telephone conversation with him on Tuesday when he was going home.
