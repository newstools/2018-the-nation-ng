There is no disagreement, quarrel or misunderstanding between the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Hon. Yakubu Dogara and the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki, the Special Adviser, Media and Public Affairs to the Speaker, Turaki Hassan has said. Dogara’s spokesman  in a statement denying the rumour of a rift between the leaders of the two Chambers said  the public should ignore lies being circulated in the social media especially Whatsapp. According to him, Dogara and Saraki have enjoyed cordial relationship in the last three years. His words: “Please beware of evil people, merchants of lies, falsehood and mendacity whose primary occupation is to concoct, contrive, fabricate and brew mischief and fake news which they spread and broadcast like wild fire on social media. “These paid minions who have sold their conscience and souls to the devil for a morsel have been broadcasting lies on social media especially WhatsApp with the sole aim of deceiving and hoodwinking the public into believing that there is a rift between the two leaders of the National Assembly – Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki and His Excellency Rt. Hon. Yakubu Dogara. “To the contrary, Dr. Saraki and Barrister Dogara have enjoyed harmonious working relationship in the last three years.” He further added: “The Rt. Hon. Speaker will never ever say those things about the President of the Senate. “But for the unsuspecting members of the public and supporters of the two leaders, we would have ignored this latest round of fallacious and fictitious perfidy which is nothing but a piece of devilish fiction as it will fizzle out and end in the pit of hell where it came from.”
