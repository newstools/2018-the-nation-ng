ARUNA Quadri’s global rating has continued to rise as the Nigerian broke into the top 18 ranking in the August 2018 ITTF ranking released at the weekend. After he displaced Egypt’s Omar Assar as the best rated African player in the world in July, the Oyo State-born athlete improved his rating, rising to the 18th place in the latest ranking by the world table tennis ruling body. Quadri who is seeded number one in the men’s single of the forthcoming ITTF Challenge Seamaster Nigeria Open, is warming up for the Lagos challenge as he is competing in an invitational tournament in Turkey. With his latest rating, Quadri has become the first Nigerian and the second African to make the monthly top 18 ranking of ITTF. To achieve his highest career ranking, Quadri rose from 20 to 18. Quadri’s status in the ranking improved following his performance at the Australian Open, where he made it to the last 16 of the men’s singles. And with this rating, the Oyo State-born athlete continues to better his own record as the only Nigerian to have achieved top 18 rating in the world. An excited Quadri believes the rating would afford him another opportunity to continue to work harder. “I am so excited with the ranking particularly with my qualification for the ITTF World Cup in France. Again, this ranking has shown that I should not relax but continue to work harder because remaining on top is one of the difficult tasks for any athlete. This goes to show that I must redouble my efforts in training and continue to compete in major competitions across the globe. I will not be carried away by this rating but be humbled by this feat and remain focused in order to maintain my status in the global rating,” the number seed of the 2018 ITTF Challenge Seamaster Nigeria Open said.
