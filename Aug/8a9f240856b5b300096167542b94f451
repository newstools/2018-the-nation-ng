The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) on Friday in Lagos arraigned a 28-year-old student, Adekunle Babalola, who allegedly impersonated a female singer, Laura George, for attempted defraud. Babalola, who resides at No. 2 Alaba Taiwo St., Kola in Alagbado area of Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of possession of documents containing false pretext at an Ikeja High Court. He, however, denied the charge but EFCC’s counsel, Mrs Zainab Ettu, told the court that Babalola committed the offences in Lagos on June 7. “He had in his possession an email dated Friday, March 23, 2018 in which he falsely represented to one Tommy whose email address is cuestus<tac754@yahoo.com that he was a female named Laura George. “He falsely claimed to Tommy using the false moniker that he was born in Ireland but grew up in the Philippines. “The defendant also had in his possession an email dated Thursday March 22, 2018 in which he falsely told one Rob Mckennie with email address rob.t.mckennie@gmail.com that he was Laura George. “On this occasion, he fraudulently informed Mckennie using his alias (Laura George) that he lives alone in New Zealand with no family and friends,’’ she said. The offences contravened Sections 1 (3), 6 and 8(b) of the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act 2006. The plea of the defendant was not taken and Ettu requested the court to remand him in prison. But the defence counsel, Mr Wale Adeboyejo, pleaded with the judge to make an order for his clients to be remanded in EFCC custody
instead of prison. The vacation judge, Justice Obafemi Adamson, remanded the accused in Ikoyi Prison and adjourned the case until Sept. 3 for the hearing
of the bail application.
