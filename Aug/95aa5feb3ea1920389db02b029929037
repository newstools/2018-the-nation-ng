The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, said on Wednesday that the defection of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, from the All Progressives Congress (APC) would not affect the fortunes of the party in the 2019 general election. In a statement issued in Abuja, the minister said while the Senate President was a member of the APC, the party did not enjoy the benefit of his membership. He said: ”If Senate President Bukola Saraki was not a member of the APC, the party and the government it leads could not have suffered more than they had already done, with regards to the delay in passing of budget, approving of key appointments and others. ”In other words, Saraki has behaved all along like a member of the opposition, deliberately slowing down the progress of the APC-led federal government. If we didn’t gain by having our member as Senate President, we stand to lose nothing by losing him. ”It is therefore neither a surprise nor a blow that he has defected. Perhaps the only surprise is that when he eventually defected, it was a mere whimper!” Mohammed said the APC can only get stronger in Kwara State by not having double agents and fifth columnists as members.
