EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called on member states to take “more responsibility” for migrants rescued in the Mediterranean Sea, as the issue made its way onto the agenda of an EU defence ministers’ meeting in Vienna. Italy’s populist government has taken a hard-line stance on migration, refusing to disembark people rescued at sea unless other EU member states offer to take them in. The issue is threatening Operation Sophia, an EU naval operation to fight human trafficking off the coast of Libya, which is set to run until the end of the year. When it was established in 2015, member states agreed that any migrants rescued would be taken to Italy. Rome is now demanding a change to those rules, threatening to close its ports to Operation Sophia’s vessels otherwise. Mogherini, who is Italian, argued that the management of migration flow is a common European issue, not one for a single country. “This is why we have a EU operation at sea and that is why I believe that, even if it’s a very difficult discussion, it would be good if member states consider taking more responsibility in this respect,” she said ahead of Thursday’s informal talks in Vienna. German Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen appealed to Italy not to hijack Operation Sophia. “It is also a question of credibility and reliability of the European mission. “We brought it into being. It runs until the end of the year. And it must continue until the end of the year,” von der Leyen said.
