The Minority Leader of Ekiti State House of Assembly, Hon. Gboyega Aribisogan has assured the people of the state that Governor-elect Kayode Fayemi will run an all-inclusive government as from October 16. The APC lawmaker representing Ikole Constituency 1 gave the assurance at Ward 7 party secretariat in Ijesa Isu Ekiti in Ikole Local government while speaking during his official declaration for second term. According to him, the incoming administration Fayemi will be different from the “one man dictatorship of the PDP and its outgoing governor.” He said: “The incoming government will be different from what we have now. It is going to be a clear departure from the dictatorship of the PDP and its governor. Fayemi will run an all-inclusive government. “Every interest and groups shall be accommodated. No one will be left out.” Aribisogan said he’s seeking for re- election because he believes he will continue to give good representation to the people of Ikole Constituency 1 based on his experience. In his words “I’m coming out again to serve you better because I believe I have the experience. You know I did my best for you during the 14 months I spent before my tenure was cut short by Ayo Fayose’s illegal suspension. Despite all my travails, I still made useful contributions to the political process in the state. I joined the progressives in the struggle to reclaim our land from the predators who wanted continuity of poverty, hardship and sufferings in our land. I became a visible minority voice and an apostle of the All Progressives Congress (APC)’s quest for restoration of our values. “I have since remained a loyal party man, unrepentant and die-hard supporter of Dr Kayode Fayemi. I promise that if given the chance again I will not disappoint you. I will not let you down.”
