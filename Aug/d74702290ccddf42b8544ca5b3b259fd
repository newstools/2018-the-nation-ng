AS plastic pollution continues to be one of the menaces of environment, beauty queen, Miller Chinonso Cherrie, who is the current Face of Port Harcourt City, has launched a program to address the menace. Called the Early Recyclers program, it is her pet project which she kicked off in June. According to the 21 year old computer science graduate of Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State, is targeted at primary school pupils because they are young and still easy to educate. “I started the Early Recyclers program in June with the aim to curb plastic pollution in fun, creative ways and preserve our planet in turn” she said. “The target for this particular project is primary school pupils. Our slogan says “It’s never too early to start.” In December 2017, Miller contested in the Miss Port Harcourt City pageant and emerged the Face of Port Harcourt City. Describing her journey so far as the Face of Port Harcourt City, she said: “It’s been a roller coaster experience with mostly highs and a few lows but totally enlightening. I basically intend to make the most of this one year and continue the charitable works even after my reign.” However, the Rivers State born beauty queen who is also a web developer revealed that things have changed for her since she won the crown. “My confidence level has increased,” she said. “I’m more aware of my environment and intentionally finding ways to make it safer and healthier for our generation and those to come.”
