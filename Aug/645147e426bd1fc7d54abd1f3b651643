Governor Ibikunle Amosun on Tuesday morning took a cursory look at the thousands Muslim faithful who joined him to observe the Eid -El – Kabir prayer at the Muslim Prayer ground, Lantoro, Abeokuta, and declared in sober tone that this year edition draws the curtain to his observing the Sallah prayer with them. Amosun who thanked Allah for his mercy upon him and the people of Ogun state for their support since May 29, 2011, said by next year, he would not return to the Lantoro prayer ground in his “capacity as a governor,” but as someone that would accompany his successor – Governor to observe the 2019 Eid -El – Kabir prayer. The Governor made this known in brief address to Muslims shortly after the prayer session conducted by the Chief Imam of Egbaland, Alh. Liadi Ogunsolu but the comment prompted many to wonder if Amosun is vaguely hinting of plan to install a Muslim as a successor from among a dozen of aspirants on the platform of the All Progressives Congress(APC) are jostling to succeed him. Joining Amosun to observe the Sallah prayer are the Commissioner of Police in the State, Ahmed Iliyasu, Chief Medical Director of Federal Medical Centre (FMC), Abeokuta, Prof. Adewale Musa, former Secretary to the state government and ex – Mines and Steel Minister, Alh. Tunji Sarafa among other dignitaries. He urged Muslim to imbibe the lessons of the Eid – El – Kabir in total submission to the will of Allah and practice them always even as he lauded the people of Ogun State for the pervasive religious harmony. “There is unity in Ogun state, everybody sees each other as one. There is nothing like this is one Christian and that one is Muslim. We are all one here. Even when I was coming, some Christians were following me,” he said. He reiterated his administration’s resolve to keep working till the hand over date in order to further develop the state and make it investors’ destination of choice.
