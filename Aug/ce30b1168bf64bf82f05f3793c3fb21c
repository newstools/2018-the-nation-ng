Ahead of the All Africa Music Awards (AFRIMA)’s nominees’ list to be unveiled on August 14, 2018, a 13-man international jury will be in Lagos today for a week-long adjudication process. This stage follows the close of entries few weeks ago with a record submission of 8,009 songs/videos from African artistes. AFRIMA’s partner hotel, Eko Hotels & Suites, Lagos, will host the jurors representing the five regions of Africa, the diaspora (Europe and North America) and the African Union Commission who will be deciding the artistes and recordings to be nominated for the 5th AFRIMA. The Jury will be screening, categorising, assessing, grading and selecting nominees into the 38 different regional and continental categories for the 23.9 carat gold-plated AFRIMA trophy. Members of the jury are drawn from each region of Africa, and one African music professional, each, representing the Diaspora; (i.e. Europe and North America), and a representative of the African Union Commission. Western Africa representatives include prolific Nigerian broadcaster Olisa Adibua, and Côte d’Ivoire music legend David Tayorault.
