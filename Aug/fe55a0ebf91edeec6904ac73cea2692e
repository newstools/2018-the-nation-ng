This time she went one better with 15 goals as Lyon made it three European titles in a row – the latest feat for a prolific forward who has more than 250 career goals by the age of 23, including 47 last term for her club, where she is now under contract till 2021.

Assists: 2 After helping Portland triumph in the American NWSL play-offs last October, Henry returned to Lyon, where the midfield anchor had previously played with glittering success between 2007 and 2016. She quickly proved the fulcrum of what would be the 28-year-old’s fourth UEFA Women’s Champions League victory with the club, crucially equalising in extra time of their 4-1 final win against Wolfsburg and being named player of the match. 2017/18 honours: UEFA Women’s Champions League winner, French League winner, NWSL winner, French Cup runner-up
