The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) yesterday presented soft copies of voters’ register for the September 22 governorship election in Osun State to the 38 political parties participating in the poll. The Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC),   Mr Olusegun Agbaje, presented the register to representatives of the parties at the INEC office in Osogbo, the state capital. The REC said some parties had approached him to collect the register individually, but he insisted that the copies must be distributed to all the parties at the same time. He noted that the presentation of the register was in line with INEC’s guidelines. Agbaje urged the parties to call the commission’s attention to any wrong they discover in the document. The REC also assured the parties of INEC’s neutrality, advising them to promptly report any officer of the commission found culpable of wrong doing, including himself, to the national headquarters of the electoral body. Agbaje gave the parties the details of the efforts INEC had made in compiling the register to ensure a successful election in Osun State. The REC urged representatives of the political parties to inform INEC about the importance of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) during the election.
