Lagos State Deputy Governor Dr Idiat Adebule has urged Nigerians to eschew violence ahead of the 2019 general election. She spoke yesterday at the Eid-prayers at Dodan Barracks Prayer Ground in Ikoyi, Lagos. News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that among dignitaries who observed the Eid prayers were the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the Minister of Works, Power and Housing and former governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Fashola. Adebule said a violence-free election would demonstrate to the world that democracy had come to stay. “As another election year approaches, I urge Nigerians to conduct themselves peacefully. “I also urge us to pray for a peaceful coexistence, enhanced national security and continued development of our dear state, Lagos and the country. “As we celebrate Sallah, we pray to God for wisdom to choose love instead of hatred, peace instead of violence and progress instead of stagnation. “By God’s grace, the future is bright as long as we allow the rule of law and peace to reign in the country,” she said. The deputy governor admonished Nigerians to pray for good governance and also sustain their support for the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration. Speaker, Lagos State House of Assembly, Mudashiru Obasa, expressed regrets that rather than engage youths meaningfully, politicians had turned them to political thugs. He enjoined youths to aspire for political positions, rather than allowing themselves to be used as thugs to foment violence during and after the elections. “If anybody wants to use you, tell such politicians to bring his or her child. Do not allow yourself to be used. “My advice to the youth is that you should show interest in politics because you are not too young to run,” he said. Obasa promised to continue to promote the business of legislature in the interest of the people.
