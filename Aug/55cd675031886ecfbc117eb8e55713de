The Vice-Chancellor of Anchor University Lagos (AUL), Prof Joseph Afolayan, has led some members of the university’s Senate to the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi (FIIRO), Lagos to kick- start a partnership and explore ways that FIIRO could assist in promoting the institution’s ideals. Afolayan told FIIRO Director-General, Prof Gloria Elemo, that his university seeks to harness FIIRO’s wealth of technologies to uplift its academic programmes to meet world standard. He expressed confidence that FIIRO could help in giving Anchor students qualitative entrepreneurial training. He said both institutions would benefit from an exchange programme that would enable scientists and researchers from FIIRO to spend their sabbatical at AUL as well as organise workshops and seminars and a host of others. Afolayan spoke on the need for both institutions to formalise the relationship by the signing of a memorandum of understanding. Elemo said strategic collaboration could help the institution realise its dreams better than working in isolation. She said FIIRO had partnered other private universities, such as Landmark, Covenant, and Mountain Top. She said collaborations could be in entrepreneurial development, saying over 500,000 Nigerians had benefited from FIIRO’s technologies. “As Anchor university works towards making their students imbibe the culture self-employment, FIIRO can bring in her technical know-how. Formalising this relationship, we hope to work together for staff exchange, sabbatical leaves, use Anchor laboratories, internships etc. All will be geared towards human capacity development that will help for first grade graduates from Anchor University,” she said. The visitors later embarked on a tour of FIIRO’s facilities.
