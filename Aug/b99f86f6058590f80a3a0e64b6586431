The Manchester City Football Club Captain Vincent Kompany says Wolverhampton Wanderers played like a well-established Premier League team against Manchester City and should be able to take points off any side in the English top flight. Wolves, which finished top of the championship last season to earn promotion, drew 1-1 with the champions on Saturday. The club drew with Everton and was beaten by Leicester City in the other two league games to start the season. “They don’t behave or play like a championship team that has just been promoted. I’m confident that they will take points off our competitors,” Kompany told British media. “They’re the typical type of team who is geared up to get big scalps because they have enough quality to play themselves out of situations when they are under pressure …. “Their key players work hard and that’s always a good mix.” Wolves’ next league game is on Saturday at West Ham United, which have lost all three of their matches so far.
