The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has raised the alarm, saying it has again uncovered a plot by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to invite, arrest and detain Senate President Bukola Saraki and his deputy Ike Ekweremadu. In a statement yesterday by the spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party accused a certain “cabal within the Presidency” of plotting to use compromised security agencies and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to execute the plot. The PDP also stated that it has unraveled fresh facts confirming that the pressure by the Presidency for the reconvening of the Senate was borne out of a sinister motive and not for any emergency in the approval of the budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for the 2019 elections. The statement said: “The fresh plot to detain the two presiding officers is part of renewed design to keep them out of circulation, ahead of Senate resumption, so as to enable the heavily induced APC senators, who are now in the minority, to throw up two of their members as Senate President and Deputy Senate President respectively on the excuse that Saraki and Ekweremadu failed to show up for proceedings in the Senate. “Apart from plots to arrest and detain Saraki and Ekweremadu, the PDP has also been made aware of plans to use the EFCC and security forces to clamp down on their family members, including their wives and siblings as well as close associate, all in the effort to weaken their resolve. “PDP was further informed that contrary to claims by the APC and the Presidency, INEC actually submitted the budget to the Presidency since February 2018, only for the Presidency to submit it to the National Assembly in July when the legislature was already going on recess; with a view to enmesh it in a needless controversy.
