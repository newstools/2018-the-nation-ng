The National Universities Commission (NUC) has endorsed the Centre for Distance and e-Learning (CDeL) of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). The approval was contained in a letter to the Vice-Chancellor, Prof Benjamin Ozumba, by the NUC Executive Chairman, Prof Abubakar Rasheed. The letter reads: “The approval is based on the validated status recommended by the panel of Open and Distance Learning (ODL) and Subject Matter Experts and NUC representatives that paid a pre-validation assessment visit to the proposed centre from 22nd to 25th April 2018.” The letter granted the university the authority to start Master’s degree programme in Business Administration (MBA) in four subject areas, namely; Accountancy, Banking and Finance, Marketing, and Management. However, the Director of the CDeL, Prof Boniface Nwogu, said the second phase of the programme would include courses in social sciences, computer science and mass communication to be taken at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels. “We have already developed programme for the courses, very soon we will invite the NUC for another round of accreditation,” Prof Nwogu said. He said the school’s MBA programmes were unique, noting that the course materials were written in a colloquial style to make the lectures interactive, conversational and understandable for students. He added that the instructional materials also included recorded video lectures stored in tablets and compact disc which would be made available to registered students. “We are fully prepared for the MBA programmes. We have modern instruction materials for the programmes, and they are unique. No other existing MBA programmes in the country can boast of our syllabus,” he said The Director described the NUC approval letter as a “remarkable achievement” for the Prof Ozumba-led management, adding that the programmes would improve quality of higher education delivery in the country and enhance the global visibility of the university’’.
