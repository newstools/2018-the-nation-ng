Edo State Government has donated relief materials to communities affected by windstorm in Esan West and Owan West local government areas of the state. The Special Adviser to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Special Duties, Hon. Yakubu Gowon, handed over the relief materials on behalf of the state government to chairmen of the two local councils in Benin City, the state capital. Gowon said governor Obaseki had earlier extended similar gesture to some communities in other local government areas in the state where windstorm wreaked havoc three months ago. He explained that Governor Obaseki has fulfilled the promise he made shortly after the disaster, to assist the affected communities. “This is a continuous exercise; as at date, we have donated relief materials to communities in about 12 local government areas and we have been receiving letters of appreciation from the beneficiaries. “While some states in the country that experienced similar disaster are still waiting for the support of the federal government, the Edo State government has gone ahead to render assistance to these communities,” he said. Receiving the items, the chairmen of the councils commended the Obaseki-led administration for bringing succour to the affected persons. The Chairman of Owan West Council, who was represented by Mr George Ohioma, assured that committees would be set up to oversee the distribution of the items as directed by the state government. The Chairman of Esan West LGA, represented by Osborn Elimhele said “we are happy about the intervention from the state government and we will ensure that the affected people get the materials.” The relief materials include roofing sheets, bags of cement, ceiling boards and bags of nails.
