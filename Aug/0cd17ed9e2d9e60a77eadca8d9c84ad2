The Lagos State government yesterday urged migrims who returned from Jerusalem to allow the spiritual exercise reflect in their conduct. Ministry of Home Affairs Permanent Secretary (PS) Mrs Toyin Awoseyi gave the advice during the thanksgiving service for the pilgrims at the Chapel of Christ The Light, Alausa, Ikeja. Pilgrimage, she said, should be a way of seeking national change and spiritual rebirth. She praised the pilgrims for their show of love and understanding before, during and after the pilgrimage. The PS warned those who believe they could abscond during the pilgrimage of the consequences of such action. “The Lagos State Christian Pilgrims Welfare Board is not a gateway for abscondment to the Holy Land. The Lagos State government frowns at this practice and anyone caught would be sanctioned appropriately,” she said. The Board’s Secretary Mrs. Yetunde Gbafe, said the government would continue to ensure hitchfree pilgrimages. The 2018 November/December registration for intending Christian pilgrims has begun she said, adding that those interested should visit the board’s office at Old Secretariat, Ikeja. In his sermon, Governing Council chairman of the church, Mr. Adegbola Arole said there was a set time for the fulfilment of God’s promises.
