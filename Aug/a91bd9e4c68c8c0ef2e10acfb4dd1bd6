A 28-year-old Uber driver, Sunday Omale, was yesterday arraigned before an Ogudu Magistrates’ Court for allegedly refusing to pay a commercial sex worker. Omale, who lives at Alhaja Elesin Street, Ogudu, is facing an assault charge, occasioning bodily harm after having three rounds of sex with Precious Mustapha. The accused was alleged to have refused paying the N6, 000 she charged him. Prosecuting Sergeant Lucky Ihiehie said the accused committed the offence on July 29 at Ogudu. Iheihei said Omale allegedly assaulted the complainant after sleeping with her. The prosecutor said the 28-year-old complainant reported the matter to the police. Iheihei said the complainant met Omale at the Afrika Shrine, Ikeja, where she charged him N6, 000 after having three rounds of sex with her. The prosecution said an argument ensued when Omale claimed he did not have cash on him to pay her. He suggested using his ATM card to withdraw for her. Iheihei said Omale drove with the complainant round Ikeja and Ogudu axis, without stopping at any bank to use his ATM card. The prosecution said Omale also deceived the complainant by driving her to his friend’s house under the pretext of collecting money from him to pay her. “Unfortunately the accused’s friend chased him out of his compound. When it became clear to the accused that there was no place where he could get money, he used an object to hit the woman on the head and started beating her,” he said. Omale pleaded not guilty. Magistrate E. Kubeinje granted the accused N50,000 bail, with two sureties in the like sum. The magistrate adjourned till September 25.
