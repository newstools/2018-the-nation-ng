The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Benue State has promised to give all aspirants equal playing ground ahead of the 2019 elections.  Deputy Chairman Prof. Kpamor J.T Orkar spoke when he received former Special Adviser to Governor Samuel Ortom on Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Titus Zam. Zam was there to seek permission from the State Working Committee to contest for governor on the party’s platform. Prof. Orkar said the party was not badly affected as most of the people who defected were not card-carrying members, but a splinter group from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) who cross-carpeted with Ortom. He maintained that APC was fully on ground in Benue before the governor was foisted on it, but said the working committee will not risk a repeat of the 2014 primaries. It will rather harness from its competent pool of members to arrive at a credible candidate that will recover its mandate in 2019. Orkar said the party zoned the governorship to Zone B and MINDA intermediate area in particular for eight years, but now that the holder of its mandate has left the party, another MINDA candidate will be allowed to complete the eight years. Zam said the party remains his immediate constituency and he felt more pleased seeking its permission first before embarking on his electoral journey. He sympathised with the party over the ill treatment it received in the hands Ortom who was given the party platform without sweat; but insisted it was time for the MINDA people to get it right this time and he has availed himself in that regard.
