Chinese state media on Thursday accused the U.S. of a “mobster mentality” in its move to implement additional tariffs on Chinese goods, and warned Beijing had all the necessary means to fight back. The comments mark a ratcheting up in tensions between the world’s two largest economies over a trade dispute. The trade dispute has already impacting industries ranging from steel to cars and causing unease over which products could be targeted next. Beijing had on Wednesday said it would slap additional tariffs of 25 per cent on 16 billion dollars worth of U.S. imports, in retaliation to news the U.S. plans to begin collecting 25 per cent extra in tariffs on 16 billion dollars of Chinese goods from Aug. 23. “The two countries’ trade conflict, which is merely push and shove at the moment, is likely to escalate into more than just a scuffle if the U.S. administration cannot marshal its mobster mentality. “China continues to do its utmost to avoid a trade war, but in the face of the U.S.’s ever greater demand for protection money, China has no choice but to fight back,” state newspaper China Daily said. So far, China has now either imposed or proposed tariffs on 110 billion dollars of U.S. goods, representing the vast majority of its annual imports of American products. Big-ticket U.S. items that are still not on any list are crude oil and large aircraft. “China has confidence in protecting its own interests, has many means,” state broadcaster CCTV said on its early morning news show. Another commentary, written by China Institute of International Studies research fellow Jia Xiudong said the U.S. was trying to “suppress China’s development”. “China should consider “unconventional methods” such as the stimulus plan used by Beijing during the global financial crisis if needed to sustain economic growth, the Global Times newspaper said in a commentary.
