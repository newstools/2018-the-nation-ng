 Super Eagles winger Victor Moses is on the verge of adding Community Shield title to his collections as Chelsea file out against Manchester City at the wembley Stadium on Sunday. Moses has premier league, FA Cup and Europa titles in the kitty and victory at the Wembley on Sunday will be another feather The former Wigan Athletic ace who converted a penalty for the Super Eagles at the World cup in Russia is being tipped to lift the Blues even as new coach Maurizio Sarri is hoping to win a title even before his first season at the Stamford Bridge. The Italian took over from compatriot Antonio Conte last month after nearly wrestling the Serie A title from Juventus with old club Napoli last season. He could become the first Premier League manager since David Moyes in 2013 in the same competition to win a trophy in his first game. Sarri said: “First of all I’m looking forward to playing at Wembley, because it’s my first time. The match will be very difficult for us. “I want to win, because it’s very important to have a trophy immediately. City manager Pep Guardiola is looking forward to starting a new rivalry with Sarri, and says his style will adapt quickly to the Premier League – having himself struggled with implementing his own style of play before City cruised to the title last season. Chelsea are looking to win the Community Shield for the first time since 2009, when they beat Manchester United 4-1 on penalties. They’ve failed to win any of their last four appearances in the Community Shield. Manchester City on the other hand last lifted the Community Shield in 2012, interestingly defeating Chelsea 3-2 in a fixture that was played at Villa Park. This will be the third meeting between Chelsea and Manchester City at Wembley, with City winning the most recent one in April 2013 (2-1 in the FA Cup semi-final). Chelsea have lost each of their last two games against Manchester City – they haven’t lost three in succession against them since September 2010.
