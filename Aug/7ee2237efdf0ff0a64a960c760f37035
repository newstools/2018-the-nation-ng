A member of Abeokuta Golf Club, Samson Arowolo has won the second Soft Alliance Golf Tournament played at the Ibadan Golf Club (IGC). Arowolo, the 5 handicapper, won the tournament with 73 Gross ahead of Monday Eze of Ikoyi Golf Club who finished with 76 Gross. The one-day tournament which was organised in honour of the Managing Director of Soft Alliance and Resources Limited, Mr Tunde Badejo, attracted 149 golfers. Biodun Hassan beat Sade Opawumi to win the Ladies Gross title with 96 Gross. The former IGC Lady Captain, Otolola Adesiyan, claimed the IGC prize with 83 Net. Arowolo expressed joy at winning the tournament saying, “It’s always good to have a channel to compete with one another and that is why I applaud the organiser of this tournament for consistency in bringing golfers together. “This is a good tournament for me because I have been training hard to improve on my handicap and hopefully before the year runs out, things would have changed.” IGC Captain, Olumide Oyediran thanked the organiser and the celebrator, Mr Tunde Badejo for investing in the development of sports, especially golf. “To IGC and those who have had cause to interact with Mr Badejo, he has been a constant source of joy, for the support he is always willing to render. We at Ibadan Golf Club certainly have enough to point to as a testimony to the club because recently, he donated a Golf Range for golfers to practice,” Oyediran said. Badejo thanked all the participants and the IGC members, just as he urged “private individuals to also invest in golf because it is an ‘entertainment’ game where people can find joy and socialise.”
