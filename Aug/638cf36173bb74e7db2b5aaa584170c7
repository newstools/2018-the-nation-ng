Traffic was at a stand still for hours yesterday on the Long Bridge portion of the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. Motorists groaned as they sweated in the traffic, waiting for the road to be cleared. The road became clogged, following an accident involving a white Mack fuel tanker marked LSR 460 XG and a white Iveco truck registered LND 818 XN. The tanker spilled its content on the road, forcing Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) officials to divert traffic to the alternate lane. FRSC Lagos Sector Commander Hyginus Omeje, said vehicles going to Ibadan were diverted at OPIC to share the road with in-bound Lagos motorists because of the crash. He said emergency response agencies were on hand to ensure safety, adding that the product was also transloaded to another tanker.” Eye witnesses said the gridlock forced some vehicles to take “one way”. Other motorists took the road linking the Kara axis of the expressway. Some vehicles broke down on the bridge because of overheating. Passengers spent hours at busstop, waiting for vehicles. A passenger, who identified himself as Paul Kuteyi, said he spent over two hours at Arepo bus stop before he could get a vehicle to Lagos. Another passenger, Florence Owase, said she could not attend church service because of the crash. Some motorists, who took the earth road on the Kara axis, were trapped on the marshy terrain. The Corps’ Public Education Officer, Bisi Kazeem, advised motorists to be cautious as another leaking tanker owned by MRS Oil has been reported at a  Mobil Filling Station on the expressway. “Another leaking tanker from MRS Oil has been reported by Mobil filling Station along Lagos/Ibadan (outward Lagos) expressway. Traffic has been diverted from toll gate to forestall fire disaster. Men of Ojota unit Command are on the ground and Lagos Fire Service has been activated,” Kazeem said.
