Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  elders and youths in Niger State have rejected governorship zoning to Niger North Senatorial District for next year’s election. They said the position of the party chairman, Tanko Beji,  on the issue was wrong. The leader of the  Concerned Youths Forum, Dr. Mohammed Bello, told  reporters in Minna, the state capital, that Beji voluntered a personal opinion, stressing that there was never a consensus on zoning. He described the chairman’s statement as “undemocratic, unconstitutional and not acceptable by the youths in the three geo political zones and should be rejected by party members.” Bello alleged that Beji was dancing to the tune of his preferred candidate and former deputy governor, Ambassador Ahmed Musa Ibeto. He said: “It is Beji’s antics to further convince Ahmed Musa Ibeto who dumped the party to join the APC in 2015 to come and contest for the governor come 2019.” The PDP stalwart advised members  to reject the push for zoning in favour of Ibeto and prepare for a democratic primary. He said no single individual can impose his wish on the generality of members. Bello added: “It a pre-planned arrangement deliberately to allowed unpopular candidate to emerge, which will surely ease the chances of the ruling APC to return to power in 2019.” The Niger State PDP has resolved during an expanded caucus meeting that the governorship ticket should be zoned to Niger North Senatorial district (Zone C). The meeting was presided over by Beji, who declared that any other candidate from Niger South or East Senatorial Zone (Zone A or B) will not be supported by the party.
