The Federal Controller, Works, Lagos, Mr Adedamola Kuti, yesterday appealed for the understanding of road users during the three days that the Third Mainland Bridge would be shut to traffic for investigative maintenance test. Kuti, at a stakeholders’ meeting held at the Federal Ministry of Works Headquarters in Lagos, said the bridge would be closed to traffic by Thursday midnight and reopen on Sunday. “Alternative routes have been provided and motorists should comply with directional signs and traffic control managers,’’ Kuti said. He said repair works had been ongoing on the alternative routes, adding that, traffic diversions would be through Ikorodu Road, Funsho Williams Avenue, Eko Bridge and Apongbon Bridge to Lagos Island. “For some time now, we have been carrying out maintenance works, we have ensured that some of the pot holes on the alternative routes had been fixed and we have been doing that for a couple of weeks,’’ he said. Federal Roads Safety Corps (FRSC) Lagos Island Unit Commander Hauwa Olowookere, advised drivers to exercise caution during the three-day closure. “We implore drivers to obey traffic officers on the road and route signs. So, we should look out for the signs, we will be seeing them very shortly on our roads directing you to diversions accordingly,” she said.
