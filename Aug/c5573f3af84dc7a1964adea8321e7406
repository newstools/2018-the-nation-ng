Super Eagles’ forward, Henry Onyekuru has declared that he is ready to line up on both sides of the flanks for Galatasaray and Nigeria after impressing on the wings for the Turkish champions last weekend, AOIFootball.com reports. The pacey attacker told AOIFootball.com exclusively from his base in Turkey, that playing on the flanks gives him more opportunity to express himself better and also create more scoring chances for his teammates. “I grew up playing as a centre-forward, but I have also learnt to adapt by playing on the flanks and I believe I can also succeed playing in that position. I played there last weekend and mostly featured in that position during preseason, so I can easily adapt to it. “I believe I can also thrive playing for Nigeria on the flanks but for now, getting an invitation and allowing the coach decide where suits me remains my aim,” Onyekuru said. The Everton loanee as so far impressed on the wings after two league matches, averaging a game rating of 7.15, completing 73% of his passes and 100% dribbles. He has also won 7 duels contested, contributing four key passes and making 2 key interceptions. His form on the flanks could offer Eagles’ gaffer Gernot Rohr a perfect option for the retired Victor Moses ahead of next month’s AFCON qualifiers against Seychelles.
