Lagos State Government yesterday unveiled sign language posters to aid communication between the deaf and dumb and the public. Speaking at the ceremony held at Alausa, Ikeja, Commissioner for Youth and Social Development Mr Agboola Dabiri said the first phase of the initiative would address communication issues between the affected persons and service providers in hospitals, police stations, front desk offices and banks. The posters, he said, were developed in response to the needs of the affected persons, who often ran into trouble with those that should assist them. Noting that the idea was the first of its kind in the country, the commissioner said the updated versions of the posters would be produced in future to include some other areas not captured in the first phase. He praised all those involved in the process from the beginning to the end, saying that the process of producing the maiden edition of the publication was daunting. “Let me emphasise that these posters would be distributed free of charge to all the relevant stakeholders at no cost and those who are interested in getting more copies of this booklet are free to approach the Lagos State Office for Disability Affairs, (LASODA),” Dabiri said. The intention of the government, he said, was to produce the electronic copy of the sign language publication so it could be accessed anywhere across the world. Dabiri urged all service providers to acquaint themselves with the various basic sign languages as indicated in the booklet so as to be able to communicate with the affected persons. LASODA General Manager Dr. Babatunde Awelenje said the booklet would play a big role in integrating the affected persons into the society. According to him, if the communication barrier with the affected persons is addressed, they can live a normal life like those without any disability.
