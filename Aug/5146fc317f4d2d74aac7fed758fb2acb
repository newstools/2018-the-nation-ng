Men have been urged to release their wives breast for six months to enable them concentrate on breastfeeding their babies. The Niger state Commissioner of Health and Hospital Services, Dr. Mustapha Jibril made this urge in a press briefing to commemorate the World Breastfeeding Week in Minna. He said that the role played by men in supporting breastfeeding is very important stressing on the need for men to be educated and have the knowledge about breastfeeding. The Commissioner who lamented that less than 40 per cent of breastfeeding mothers breastfeed their babies exclusively said that one tenth of the under five children who die is as a result of them not being breastfed. The State Nutritionist, Amina Isah further urged men to support their wives in undertaking some house chores so that the house load in the house would be reduced for them to breastfeed their babies comfortably. She then stressed on the need for adequate feeding with the right nutrition urging women to stay away from artificial breast milk and processed food until after the baby is past six months.
