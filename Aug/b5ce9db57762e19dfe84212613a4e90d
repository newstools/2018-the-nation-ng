Over 2,000 indigent families in Lagos, Ogun and other southwest states yesterday received meat from the Nigerian Tulip International College (NTIC) Foundation in the spirit of Sallah. The school Principal, Ercan Yilmaz, said 60 cows were slaughtered and distributed to the people. Yilmaz said 1,500 families from Lagos and Ogun benefited from the gesture. The remaining families were from other Southwest states. He said the lists of beneficiaries were obtained from mosques, churches, adding that other stakeholders, such as religious leaders and public service workers – Police and local government officials also benefited. “We also extended the gesture to the Ministry of Education, State Universal Education Board (SUBEB), among other stakeholders as a symbol of love,” he said. The gesture, according to Yilmaz, was aimed at touching the lives of the less privileged. He said: “Our belief is that any establishment or corporate entity should endeavour to touch the lives of people in its immediate community. “This is why our branches in other parts of the federation take care of the distribution in states within their regions simultaneously.  Similar programmes are replicated during Christmas.”
