The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of the federation, Mr. Abubakar Malami, has been urged to commence action to declare seats of defecting legislators in the National Assembly vacant. Rights activist and social crusader in Delta state, Oghenejabor Ikimi, said in a statement in Warri on Friday that said this was necessary to strengthen the country’s “fledgling” democracy. Citing the Supreme Court’s case of Abegunde vs. Ondo State House of Assembly & Ors (2015) LPELR-24588 Ikimi called for vigilance on the part of the electorate against supporting greedy politicians for the 2019 polls. Ikimi said: “I am not oblivious of the civic duty we owe the Nigerian nation as citizens in protecting and defending her fledgling democracy, hence my call to the federal and states’ attorneys general to unseat all erring federal and state legislators vide the law courts. “Nigerians especially her electorate must shun greedy politicians and must not allow them to truncate our democracy or turn same into a tool for seizing power illegally or to cause disunity and disaffection in our polity. “The Nigerian electorate must resist all political mercenaries masquerading themselves as politicians by all lawfully means through the ballot box.”
