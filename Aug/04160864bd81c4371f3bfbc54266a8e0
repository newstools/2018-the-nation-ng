A non-profit organisation (NGO), Empower 54, dedicated to humanitarian services and eradication of malnutrition in Africa, has partnered traditional rulers and local government chairmen in Edo State to distribute medication that will improve children and pregnant women’s health. The medications to be distributed are Albendazol, which is used  for treating and preventing various parasitic worm infections for children between six months and five years; and prenatal vitamins for pregnant women for 271, 000 beneficiaries. According to Empower 54 President/Executive Director, Princess Modupe Ozolua, the medical outreach programmes would run from August to September in Owan West, Owan East, Etsako and Akoko-Edo Local Government Area. She said the organisation was embarking on the initiative because of its passion for the health of children and also in line with the objective of the Federal Government healthcare project focused on the poor, especially women and children under five years.
