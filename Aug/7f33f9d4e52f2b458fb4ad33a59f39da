President Muhammadu Buhari has felicitated with Muslims over the Eid-el Kabir, urging for the promotion of harmony and tolerance in dealing with one another at all times. Buhari, in his Sallah message, posted on his verified Twitter account, also called Nigerians to rise above personal, group, sectarian and other interests. He said: “I felicitate with all Nigerians, particularly the Muslim faithful, on this year’s celebration. I assure you all that our administration will not rest or relent as we work to build the Nigeria of our dreams—secure, prosperous and free from the ravages of corruption. “On this occasion of Eid-ul-Adha, I urge all Nigerians to rise above personal, group, sectarian and other interests, and to promote harmony and tolerance in dealing with one another at all times. “We must imbibe this lesson and make it a duty to sacrifice for others and to always remember those who are less fortunate than ourselves. Selfishness, greed and corruption have no place in our lives and in our dealings with one another.”
