An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant in Ogun State, Otunba Adewale Adenaike, has hailed the party’s leadership for adopting open primary for next year’s election. Adenaike noted that an open primary “is the best choice to give the people a choice to pick their candidate according to their conscience”. Addressing some youths at his campaign headquarters in Ijebu-Ode, the aspirant said the party’s new policy to elect candidates to political offices would enable youths to cast their votes for aspirants of their choice without being monetised. He added that party members should hail the Comrade Adams Oshiomole-led new agenda and support the national chairman’s re-engineering activities to reposition the party. Adenaike said: “I call on you to support the open primary policy which has given the youths a voice to elect their leaders under a free and fair process that will usher in the best candidate to contest the governorship election in Ogun State. “The open primary policy is another milestone in the leadership stride of our amiable national chairman, Comrade Oshiomole, in his efforts to raise the bar of progress in our great party.” The aspirant urged the youths to shun the stipends given by those who have nothing to offer except drag them back the development process of the government if they are eventually elected into office stressing that the stipend they receive today is the future suspended. On the wrong placement of his photograph beside the story of a cleric, Adenaike said although he is a Christian, but that he is not prejudiced in his belief. The APC chieftain said only God can determine the righteous. He added: “There is always a time when men under pressure make mistakes. I have nothing to do with the statements credited to the cleric. It was an error and it is not uncommon to this profession alone.”
