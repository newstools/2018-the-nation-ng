The lawmaker representing Akoko-Edo federal constituency in the House of Representative, Hon Peter Akpatason, has said that those defecting from the All Progressive Congress do not fit into the vision of the party. Hon Akpatason said the defectors would lose next year’s general election because they left good people in the APC to join bad people. Akpatason who spoke to reporters in Benin City said the defectors won elections in 2015 because of the good people they met in the APC. He argued that the PDP was not a beautiful bride for defectors but a dumping ground for those he termed waste product. According to him, “For you to effect development, you need the good, the bad and the ugly but in the process of development, you begin to see the good from the bad and the ugly. “At some point, it becomes clear to some people that they do not fit into the system and that is what is happening now. They jump ship to where they actually belong to. Some people jumped ship some years ago because they wanted to contest election and they thought it was the APC platform and also the Buhari tsunami including the dynamics of their local politics. “PDP is a dumping ground for waste product and not a beautiful bride. Somebody who decamped four years ago and is defecting now is a waste product. They don’t have value to add to the system. People of value and command respect do not defect but only political merchants who see political parties as a platform.”
