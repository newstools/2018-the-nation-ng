The All Progressives Congress ( APC ) in Ondo State has mourned the exit of one of its leaders, Chief Noah Adesoji. The late political and community leader passed on last weekend at the age of 83. He was the Ondo State Chairman of the defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN). The State Chairman of the APC, Ade Adetimehin, described the death of the octogenarian as a deep blow to the State chapter, “especially at this time when he should be reaping from his years of political toiling”. Adetimehin, who led members of the State Working Committee (SWC) to commiserate with the bereaved family in Ile-Oluji, said the departed leader lived a rewarding life,saying he was like a father to many of them. He said: “Pa Adesoji was a reliable and trustworthy leader; he was a party man to the core, and a progressive till his last day on earth. Adetimehin prayed that God would console the bereaved family. He informed them that Governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu had assured that the State government would be deeply involved in the burial of the former progressives leader. Responding on behalf of the family, one of the deceased children, Kehinde Adesoji, thanked the State Government and the APC for standing by the family over the loss of their father. The young Adesoji said although his later father was above 80, but noted that “we never wished he should leave at this time because he remained a pillar of the family”.
