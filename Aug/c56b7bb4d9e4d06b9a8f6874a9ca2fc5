The Falconets have lost their first match at the ongoing FIFA U-20 World Cup in France in an encounter against their perennial rivals, Germany, on Monday. The Nigerian U-20 girls lost by a lone goal in the Group D encounter played in Saint Malo, France. The first match of the group ended goalless after the first 45 minutes, but Germany however broke the deadlock in the 69th minute as Stefani Sanders converted a close range ball played from corner-kick. All efforts by the Coach Christopher Danjuma led- side to level up proved abortive till the end of the 90-minute encounter. The Falconets are making their ninth appearance in the biennial championship which began in 2002 in Canada. They have featured in all the editions and were runners up in 2010 and 2014 losing both finals to Germany. The Falconets who have impressive records in the championship failed to qualify from the group stages only twice in 2002 when they debuted in Canada and the last edition in Papua New Guinea where they lost out to Spain on goal difference. The teamâ€™s next fixture is against Haiti on Thursday.
