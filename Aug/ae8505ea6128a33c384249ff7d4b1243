The Igbo Socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has called on the Federal Government to conduct a thorough investigation into Tuesday’s siege at the National Assembly by operatives of the Department of State Security (DSS). The organisation, in a statement signed by its The President General of the Ohanaeze, Chief John Nnia-Nwodo, on Wednesday in Abuja, described the action of the security operatives as an equivalent of a coup. He said all the characters that participated in the act either directly or indirectly be made to face the law in order to act as a deterrent to overzealous operatives. Chief Nwodo, called on to the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, to go beyond the sacking of the former Director General of DSS, Lawal Daura and institute a high powered investigation to fish out all the culprits involved. He said it was not possible for the DSS to carry out the siege alone without the involvement of the Nigeria Police. Chief Nwodo doubted the noninvolvement of the Police on the siege and urged the VP to critically examine the role of the Police and its claim that it did not participate as possible after thought only after the ‘coup’ failed. The Ohanaeze leader said the siege brought an enormous embarrassment to the country, urging the government not treat the matter with levity. The statement reads: “If the state security can just wake up and seal up the National Assembly housing the country’s parliament they could go further one day to over throw government after discussing with some interest groups. “As a constitutionally recognized arm of government with its own statutory responsibilities, if there is a disagreement within them, they should be allowed to resolve it themselves unless there is violence before the security can be involved. Chief Nwodo noted that democracy would be better served if all the arms of government are allowed to operate without undue interference from each other.
