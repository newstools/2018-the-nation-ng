A Kaduna Sharia Court sitting at Magajin Gari yesterday ruled that Ibrahim Musa was the father of the four-month-old baby girl delivered by his wife, Aisha Buhari. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Aisha had on July 2, dragged her husband before the court following his refusal to accept paternity of the baby she delivered. The Judge, Malam Dahiru Lawal, after listening to both parties and their witnesses, said that under Islamic law, Musa could not now deny paternity of the baby after knowledge of his wife’s pregnancy two weeks after their marriage. “In Islam when one suspects his wife of infidelity and is in doubt of the legitimacy of her pregnancy, he must raise alarm and inform his guardian and that of his wife immediately. “ But when a man continues having marital affairs with his wife even after the knowledge of the pregnancy without showing contempt then it means he has accepted the pregnancy. That means he is the father to the child and would take full responsibility of the child”, the judge ruled. NAN recalled that the respondent, who was represented by a lawyer, was asked to present himself to the court on July 16. Musa during hearing of the case had told the court that he denied paternity of the baby because she was given birth to five months after their marriage.
