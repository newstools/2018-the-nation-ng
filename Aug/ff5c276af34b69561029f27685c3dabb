Insinuation about All Progressives Congress (APC) membership status of the Speaker of the House of Representatives Yakubu Dogara gathered momentum Wednesday as one of his aides joined the race for Bauchi State House of Assembly. Iliya Habila, one of Dogara’s media aides would be contesting for the Bagoro Constituency under the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). He would be representing the Speaker in the State House of Assembly if successful at the polls. The journalist, who has not resigned his appointment with the Speaker, is from the same Constituency with Speaker Dogara, which further cast doubts over Dogara’s commitment to APC. Since the defection of the President of the Senate Bukola Saraki from the All Progressives Congress (APC) to PDP shortly before the National Assembly went on its annual recess, insinuations have been rife about the defection of Dogara. Dogara is yet to announce his defection from APC, though he has been absent from key meetings of the leadership of the party for a number of reasons. On one of his social media accounts on Friday, Habila urged his supporters to join him on Saturday at the PDP secretariat for his formal presentation as a contestant for the State House of Assembly. He said: “Friends, pls joins us at the PDP secretariat Bagoro LGA tomorrow Saturday as history will be made, with my formal presentation to the party officials as an aspirant to the position of member, Bagoro Constituency, Bauchi House of Assembly. “It’s a new dawn of new era in representative democracy. Pray, support and work for the restoration of the glory of Bagoro constituency support the Iliya Habila team. Iliya na kowa, Don kowa!”
