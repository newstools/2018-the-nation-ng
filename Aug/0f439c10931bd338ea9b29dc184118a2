Three persons have been arrested in Edo State for attempting to kidnap an Emeritus Professor Joshua UnuiGboje Aiseku. Names of the three suspects were given as Adamu Aminu aged 23, Tamuno Diepreye Samuel aged 19 and Ovie Raymond  aged 21. They were said to have threatened to kidnap and kill Prof. Aiseku if he did not pay them the equivalent sum of N7.5m. The suspects provided a Turkish bank account number 851838335002 with account name, Akunday Aorah into which their victim was to pay the money. Police Commissioner, Babatunde Kokumo, told newsmen that the main suspect, Adamu Aminu, was like a son to Prof. Aiseku. Kokumo explained that Adamu’s father worked as a security man to Prof. Aiseku. He said Prof. Aiseku paid for the education of Adamu and even allowed him to live with him. The Police CP stated that Prof. Aiseku sent Adamu to another school when he was rusticated from the first school he was enrolled into. In a chat with newsmen, Adamu said there was no intention to kill Prof. Aiseku since the man did no harm to him. He said he got the two others in River State to provide a Techno phone and the account number where the money would be paid into and blamed the devil for the act. Ovie who provided the Turkish account number said he didn’t know it was to be used to collect ransom payment.
