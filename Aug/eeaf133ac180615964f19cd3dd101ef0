Lagos State Government is planning to decongest the prisons by adopting the plea bargain aspect of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law (ACJL). A team from the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) yesterday visited Ikoyi and Kirikiri Prisons, to educate inmates on the initiative. The Director of Public Prosecution (DPP), Mrs Titilayo Shitta-Bay, said the government was concerned with the huge population of prisons inmates in the state. She said there was need to implement initiatives, such as the plea bargain concept, to reduce the figures. To her, the inmates, who are guilty of the offences against them, should embrace plea bargain, save time and serve lesser punishment. She said: “Plea Bargain will help to reduce the punishment for inmates, save public funds and time, and that is why the government is purposely using the initiative to also decongest prisons in the state.” Shitta-Bay said an applicant for plea bargain would state why he is entering into it, adding that it would be considered only on merit and based on the seriousness of the offence for which the applicant is to be sentenced. “The lawyers would write their recommendations too and the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice would consider the facts of the matter and circumstances,” she said. Controller of Prisons Ikoyi Prison Tolu Ogunsakin praised the government for its proactive approach to decongesting prisons. “You have always been praying for freedom and Lagos State Government has brought you the opportunity so embrace it and confess to the crime that brought you to prison instead of wasting your time and energy here”, he said.
