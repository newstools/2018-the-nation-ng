Sen. Ajayi Boroffice, representing Ondo Central Senatorial District, has applauded the adoption of direct primaries by the All Progressives Congress (APC) in choosing its candidates for the 2019 elections. Boroffice gave the commendation in a statement issued by his media aide, Mr Kayode Fakuyi on Friday in Akure. “As the preparations for primary elections are close, it is necessary to reassure members of the All Progressives Congress in Ondo State that the national leadership of our party ably led by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole has adopted direct primary as the only means of electing party candidates in Ondo State. “The position of APC on direct primary is clear. It states that direct primary will hold in APC – governed states while indirect primary/delegate primary will hold in states where the state governments are not governed by APC. “It should also be noted that President Muhammadu Buhari, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and other prominent leaders of our party have thrown their weights behind the party on the adoption of direct primary. ” Therefore, the adoption of direct primary is a settled matter. It is unambiguous. It is not controversial. It is clear,” the statement quoted the senator as saying.
According to him, the adoption of direct primaries will deepen democracy and ensure popular participation in the APC. Boroffice said that the national leadership of the party had empowered all party members in Ondo State with voting powers for the purpose of nominating flag bearers of the APC in the 2019 general elections. The senator, who is the Chairman, Senate Committee on Science and Technology, said no individual or group could hijack such voting powers from the party members. He said that the adoption of direct primaries has the  support of prominent leaders of the party (NAN)
