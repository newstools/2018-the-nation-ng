Isa said the suspect drugged a motorcyclist, Gide Wada, who was conveying her from Kofar-Kaura to Sokoto Rima Quarters in Katsina metropolis. The police spokesman said Wada had to park his motorcycle when he started becoming drowsy after he ate a piece of chocolate the suspect gave to him as they were moving to her destination. According to him, it was after the victim parked the motorcycle that he became unconscious and the suspects’ accomplices,one Abubakar and Chairman, now at large, attempted to snatch the motorcycle. He explained that the accomplices ran into the bush when the condition of the motorcyclist attracted the attention of people nearby, who apprehended Zinatu and handed her over to the police. Isa claimed that the suspect had confessed to have been committing such offence in Kaduna and Kano states, adding that the police were on the trail of her accomplices.
