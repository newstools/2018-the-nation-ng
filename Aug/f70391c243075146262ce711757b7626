The Lagos State Boxing Coaches Association has commended pay-television service provider, GOtv, for its consistent support for Nigerian boxing through the GOtv Boxing Night and Nigeria Boxing Board of Control (NBB of C) for its efforts at promoting professional boxing in the country. Auditor General, Lagos State Boxing Coaches Association, Babalola Oladipo Abayomi, who noted that GOtv had taken professional boxing to a high level, said this has set the pace for other promoters to invest in the sport. According to Abayomi, who is also the assistant secretary general of the NBB of C, more fights have been scheduled in the coming months. “Since the new board of the Nigeria Boxing Board of Control came into power, they have produced African champions, West African champions and so on. “Likewise coaches who have been spending their money to ensure that boxers are in top shape. That is why I appreciate GOtv for spending a lot of money to ensure that Nigeria boxers are promoted through the GOtv Boxing Night. If boxers train on a daily basis and nothing to show for it, it will bring down their morale and they will be discouraged. “I want to promise boxers and boxing fans that very soon they will witness constant boxing promotions because promoters are coming in regularly now due to the work of Secretary General of the NBB of C, Remi Aboderin and other excos who have put their hands together to the growth of professional boxing in the country. “NBB of C under the leadership of Dr Rafiu Ladipo has been doing a good job because there is no time a Nigerian boxer is fighting abroad that he will not travel there to go and give him support. Some of the members on NBB of C who are buoyant enough also go and watch our boxers,” Abayomi said.
