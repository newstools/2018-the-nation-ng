After spending three days at Mina in Saudi Arabia, Lagos pilgrims will today return to Mecca in continuation of the major hajj rites. Commissioner for Home Affairs Dr AbdulHakeem AbdulLateef made this known yesterday while educating the pilgrims on the next activity after completing the rites in Mina. He said that all logistics had been put in place for a hitchfree journey. “We have arranged for buses that will take you back to Mecca as soon as you throw the third day pebbles. As such, you must have thrown 49 pebbles in three days as required by Allah and the next thing is to perform your Tawaful Infadah, then Safa and Marwa which are the climax of the hajj rites in Mecca,” he said. He explained that the third day pebbles must be thrown early in the day because if the sun sets and you are still in Mina, you will have to throw another stone on the fourth day. AbdulLateef said the pilgrims would start returning home from next week. “The first Lagos flight is most likely to depart Mecca on Tuesday, while others will take place depending on the schedule that will be released by National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) and the government of Saudi Arabia”. As soon as the departure dates are announced, the pilgrims will perform the Tawaful Wadai which means farewell to Kabbah before leaving for home.
