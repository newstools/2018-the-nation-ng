Manchester United survived a late scare against Leicester City to begin their Premier League campaign with a 2-1 victory at Old Trafford last night. Paul Pogba’s third-minute penalty and Luke Shaw’s first professional goal earned the Red Devils three points which came under threat in stoppage time through Jamie Vardy’s reply. Pogba’s inclusion from the start was a bit of a surprise considering his lack of pre-season in the aftermath of France’s World Cup triumph, and Mourinho even but the captain’s armband on the midfielder in the absence of Antonio Valencia. When the Red Devils were given a second-minute penalty for handball against Daniel Amartey, who leaned into the bouncing ball with his arm, Pogba pulled rank to take the spot kick ahead of Alexis Sanchez and lift it confidently above Kasper Schmeichel. The Foxes responded well and the left-wing tandem of Ben Chilwell and Demarai Gray caused United problems. The latter supplied Kelechi Iheanacho on 15 minutes, although the Nigerian was flagged offside before shooting inches wide of the post. James Maddison and Ricardo Pereira were the two debutants in Leicester’s XI and they combined for the best equalising chance of the first half. The playmaker signed from Norwich City was teed up 15 yards out but saw his right-footed shot strongly pushed away by David de Gea. Shaw fired the Foxes a warning shot on the stroke of the break as he exchanged a one-two with Juan Mata before cutting inside onto his right foot to strike low at Schmeichel.
