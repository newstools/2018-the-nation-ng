Super Eagles’ winger, Victor Moses has announced his retirement from international football. The Nigeria international issued a statement on his official Instagram account on Wednesday to confirm his exit from the national team set up. The 27-year-old brings an end to a six-year spell with the Super Eagles, during which he won the African Cup of Nations and featured in two World Cups. The message reads, “I would like to announce that after much thought, I have made the decision to retire from playing international football. “I have experienced some of the best moments of my life wearing the Super Eagles’ shirt and have memories with me that will last a lifetime. Nothing will ever compete to what it felt like to represent Nigeria. “However I feel that now is the right time to step away in order to be able to focus fully on my club career and my young family, as well as allow the next generation of Super Eagles’ stars the leeway to step up and flourish. We are blessed as a nation to have so many exciting young players coming through and now is their time. “There are so many highlights that stand out for me over the years; from making my debut, to playing in two World Cups and being a part of the team to win the African Nations Cup for the first time for our nation since 1994 is just a few of them. “I have already spoken to the manager by telephone and would like to say thank you to him and his staff, the NFF and all of my teammates for all of their support over the years. Most importantly I would like to say thank you to the Nigerians for believing in me and supporting me over the years. It meant the world to me and my family and I will always be a proud Nigerian supporting the team. “Thank you for the memories and good luck to the team for the future,” the statement read.
