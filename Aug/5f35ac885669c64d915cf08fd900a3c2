Actress Stephanie Linus’ reality show, ‘Make Me Fabulous’, may be doing the magic of igniting the spark in marriages, considering some emotional moments on the show currently airing on DSTV Channel 151. In its second season, the show which features 13 married couples has a vow renewal ceremony where they both reaffirm their love for one another and pledge to work together to strengthen their marriage. On Episode 2 which aired on Sunday 20th August, a unique couple – Joyful and Temitope – brought tears to the eyes of many viewers during their emotional vow renewal ceremony. Another interesting time on the show was when the host, Stephanie Linus, prayed for the couple and gave them some useful advice. ‘Make Me Fabulous’ is an unscripted show that is committed to ensuring that marriages work and that the family unit is shrouded in love.
