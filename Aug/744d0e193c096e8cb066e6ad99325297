An All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant, Temitope Kuyebi, has called on the people of Yewa-Awori (Ogun West) to keep praying for Governor Ibikunle Amosun not to renege on his promise to work for the realisation of the zone’s dream of producing the next governor of Ogun State in 2019. Kuyebi, the youngest among the zone’s governorship aspirants, said the “2019 Ogun West for Governorship Agenda” can’t be achieved without interceding on behalf of Amosun so that he does  not falter in his avowed resolve to hand over the baton of power to an Ogun West person in May 2019. The aspirant, who hails from Imasai in Yewa North, made the call while addressing a crowd of APC members, supporters and youth leaders at Agunloye Pavilion, Empire Building, Ilaro, Yewa South Local Government Area of Ogun State. He noted that the zoning of the governorship ticket of APC to Ogun West was a good omen, but warned that the golden opportunity zoning presented to the area must not be allowed to elude them this time.
