A former Police Corporal, Michael Eriarebhe, has been arrested for allegedly engaged in armed robbery. Michael was dismissed from the Nigeria Police for offences against discipline and was subsequently charged to court. He was also said to have defiled a 17-year old girl and put her in a family way. Police sources said he was arrested for robbing his victim the sum of N5, 000 with his former police identity card. Michael who protested the charge of robbery preferred against him said the person willingly gave him the N5000. He said he was yet to return the police identity card issued to him after he was dismissed. On his previous case of defilement, Michael said the girl was above 17 years old. Police Commissioner, Babatunde Kokumo, said the arrest of Michael was an indication that the police was right to have earlier dismissed him.
