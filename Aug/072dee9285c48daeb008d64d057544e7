The Managing Director of Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Ms Hadiza Usman, yesterday said the two-kilometre Apapa Wharf Road now being rebuilt will be opened next month. Ms Usman said the reconstruction, which would cost N4.34 billion, would enable the Federal Government to achieve Ease of Doing Business. She said NPA was working with the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing to rehabilitate all ports’ access roads in the country to ensure a level-playing field and to also facilitate trade. According to her, NPA and the ministry will develop a mechanism for funding the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the roads. Ms Usman said the government had also approved the  reconstruction of Tin-Can Island Port access road to Mile 2.
