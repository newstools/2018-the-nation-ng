Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has warned importers of school uniform materials to Nigeria from China based companies, Sing Shun Fat School Clothier Company and Zenith Uniform Company, about cancer causing substances found in the materials. Spokesman for SON Osita Aboloma said the 4- amino azo dyes, which were found in school uniforms in Hong Kong, contained up to 173 milligrams and 41 milligrams per kilogram of the tested samples, which were well above the maximum allowed in the standard. He said: “The 4-amino azo dyes have been banned in Europe, Japan and other parts of the world prior to the finding. “They can release carcinogenic substances known as aromatic amines when they mix with sweat, which accounted for the ban on the use of the dyes in many countries. “Importers of school uniform materials in Nigeria should endeavour to undergo the process of conformity assessment of such materials prior to import, through the SON off shore conformity assessment programme, SONCAP, in order to avoid bringing these products to the country.” Aboloma advised Nigerians to report suspected uniform materials that may already be in the country to SON for sampling, laboratory tests and analysis to be carried out at its Textile and Leather Laboratory in Kaduna for regulatory action. International Accredited Firms (IAFs) undertaking the off-shore conformity assessment programme on behalf of the SON, all over the world, have been put on alert regarding the cancer-causing substance in school uniform materials and other clothing materials to be imported into Nigeria.
