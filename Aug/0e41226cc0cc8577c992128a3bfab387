Tobi Bakre, BBNaija season three finalist, has clamoured for more platforms to appreciate the creativity and hard work of young people as he hosted the Nigerian Teen Choice Awards (NTCA). The event, which took place in Lagos on Sunday, celebrated several young people who had contributed immensely to societal growth. The NTCA is an annual event that celebrates and encourages deserving teenagers and personalities in various categories including music, lifestyle, media, movies, education, fashion and innovation. Tobi, who was constantly cheered on as he chaperoned the show, appreciated the NTCA, adding that if such platforms existed when he was younger, he might had done better. According to him, “We would have done more with our creativity if platforms like this existed as it is exciting to know that people are around to cheer you up.” Tobi, who is also a photographer, actor and model, urged the older generation to join social media to view the works of young people and appreciate them. He said, “Our daddies and mummies, please join us on Instagram and Facebook, there is a lot happening there and support the younger ones.” Meanwhile, several exciting performances were displayed by upcoming teenage artists, some of whom were nominated for awards. The most notable awards for the night went to popular teenage producer and singer, Dr Jazz who won ‘Choice Producer of the Year’ and ‘Choice Male Vocalist’. Also, child star musician Queenyano Ohunene clinched the ‘Outstanding Young Female Artist of the Year’ award. Beginning from 2012, the NTCA has issued over 300 awards to young people including Seyi Shay, Davido, Praiz, Tekno and Korede Bello.
