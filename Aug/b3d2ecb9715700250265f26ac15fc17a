As part of ongoing efforts to improve quality education by leveraging Information Communication Technology (ICT), the Edo State Government has partnered with SAP, an international software company, on a 2-day digital literacy workshop for 500 secondary school teachers across the state. The Edo State Government is organising the training tagged Digital Literacy Workshop through its Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA). It will hold from August 30 to 31, at the ICT Agency CBT Center, Government Secretariat Building, High Court Road, Benin City. Director, Edo State Information Communication Technology Agency, Yuwa Naps, in a statement, noted that the workshop is being put together by the agency and the Post Primary Education Board in partnership with SAP, West Africa. He added that Governor Obaseki will be on ground to launch the training. Naps explained “the workshop will take train-the-trainer model and will expose 500 teachers across the state to coding (SCRATCH levels 1 & 2) and web programming.” He said the participants will be organised in batches and awarded with certificate at the completion of the workshop. The training is coming only few days after the state government approved the full roll-out of the Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (Edo-BEST) programme, which will see over 60,000 pupils in three local governments of the state access top-of-the-range basic education powered by technology. The Edo-BEST programme is a state-wide basic education reform that will see schools leapfrog and keep track of the emerging issues in digitally-driven pedagogy. The state government is overhauling its education sector to be more responsive to needs of the society and the continuous training of teachers to teach in line with the demands of the digital age is one of the Governor Obaseki-led administration’s goals for the sector.
