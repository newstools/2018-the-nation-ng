Standard Chartered to pay N2.4b
Stanbic IBTC N1.8b
Citibank N1.2b Diamond Bank N0.25b MOBILE giant MTN Nigeria is to refund $8,134,312, 397.63 it illegally repatriated to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the apex bank said yesterday. The CBN said it had imposed N5.87 billion sanctions on four banks, which are to refund $8,134,312, 397.63 for “flagrant violation of extant laws and regulations of Nigeria, including the Foreign Exchange (Monitoring and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995 of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and the Foreign Exchange Manual, 2006”. So far, the telco has paid N165 billion out of N330 billion fine, representing 60 per cent of total payment, according to the CEO of NCC, Prof Umar Danbatta. CBN’s Director, Corporate Communications, Isaac Okorafor, in a statement in Abuja, said the actions of the apex bank became necessary following allegations of remittance of foreign exchange (forex) with irregular Certificates of Capital Importation (CCIs) issued on behalf of some offshore investors of MTN Nigeria Communications Limited and subsequent investigations carried out by the apex bank in March this year. The four lenders also came under the sledge hammer of the CBN for violations of extant forex regulations. The lenders are Standard Chartered Bank, Stanbic-IBTC, Citibank, and Diamond Bank. Figures obtained from the CBN yesterday indicate that the highest fine of N2,470,604,767.13 was slammed on Standard Chartered Bank. Stanbic IBTC Nigeria was fined N1,885,852,847.45. Citibank Nigeria was penalised N1,265,541,562.31. Diamond Bank was directed to pay N250 million. Okoroafor said the decision followed thorough investigations into the allegations of remittances by the four banks of forex with irregular certificates of CCIs issued on behalf of some offshore investors of MTN Nigeria Communications Limited. He said $3,448,119,321.72 was repatriated by Standard Chartered Bank on the basis of the illegally issued CCIs. Similarly, $2,632,005,623.78, $1,766,263,212.75 and $348,914,501.30 were repatriated by Stanbic IBTC Nigeria, Citibank Nigeria and Diamond Bank Plc between 2007 and 2015. The CBN directed the banks to immediately refund the sums. The apex bank’s investigation revealed that on account of illegal conversion of MTN shareholders’ loan to preference shares (interest free loan) of $399,594,146.00, $8,134,312,397.63 was illegally repatriated by the telco. Okoroafor  said investigations by the CBN took a while in order to carry out a thorough inquiry and give fair hearing to all parties involved. He advised all banks and multinational companies to adhere strictly to the provisions of all extant laws and regulations in their forex transactions. He warned that failure by the management of banks and companies to abide by existing guidelines would be appropriately sanctioned. Sanctions may include denial of access to local forex market. About two years ago, the telco was accused of illegally repatriating $13.8 billion. It blamed its failure to comply with the law requiring issuance of CCIs within 24 hours of conversion on “administrative requirement”. During the opening of investigative hearing by the Senate Committee on Banks, Insurance and Other Financial Institutions into the transfer, MTN said circumstances beyond its control necessitated its decision to move funds without following the law. A lawmaker had accused MTN of flouting its host country’s financial regulatory laws to obtain a CCI within 24 hours before moving the money out of the country without the required authorisation. The repatriation was allegedly carried out between 2006 and 2016 in connivance with the Minister of Trade and Investment, Okechukwu Enelamah, and four commercial banks – Standard Chartered Bank, Stanbic IBTC, Diamond Bank and Citi Bank. The CCI is a requirement under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) financial and miscellaneous provisions Act. The telco’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ferdi Moolman, had said it was practically impossible for the firm to comply with the 24 hours required to issue the CCI before moving funds. “The requirement to issue a CCI within 24 hours of conversion is an administrative requirement. As such, the CBN has the authority, and indeed we believe approved the banks’ applications to issue CCIs outside the recommended time frame. “Often, for various reasons (such as not having all the required documentation for instance), it is not possible to issue a CCI within 24 hours, and the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Forex Manual contemplates such situations by asking that the banks refer to the CBN for approval,” Mr. Moolman had explained in a statement from Johannesburg, South Africa. He said no dividends were declared or paid until the CCIs were issued and finalised, adding that MTN Nigeria only requested CCIs for Foreign Capital that was imported into Nigeria, and dividends were externalised on CCIs.
