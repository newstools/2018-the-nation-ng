England international and Leicester City forward Jamie Vardy has announced his retirement from international football, citing desire to concentrate on club football and have time for family as reasons for the move. The 31 year old who was part of the Three Lions squad to the World cup in Russia has already communicated head coach Gareth Southgate of his decision. Vardy’s reason is the same with that presented by Chelsea winger and Nigerian international Victor Moses few weeks back. Both players were in Russia where their teams crashed out in the first round and semi-finals respectively. Vardy has however not ruled out the possibility of a bounce back in the event of injury crisis but believes the time is right to move back from international duty. Vardy who was capped over 26 times scoring seven times for the Three Lions has scored over 83 goals for Leicester still counting. ‘This has been on my mind for a while,’ Vardy told the Guardian. ‘I’m not getting any younger and you can see, to be fair to the gaffer, he wants to make it more youthful, which obviously had its benefits during the World Cup. ‘So I just said to Gareth that I think it’s probably best from now on, especially with the way he wants to go, to bring youngsters in who he thinks have got the ability and start nurturing them into international football.’ Vardy, who was joined by Gary Cahill in calling time on his international career on Tuesday, rose from non-league football to win the Premier League title and earn 26 England caps, scoring seven goals. He played at Euro 2016 and this summer’s World Cup. While Southgate may have been on the same page with Vardy, Moses’ exit was a surprise to Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr who has hinted he will talk to the 27 year old with view to making him consider a change of mind.
