A middle-aged pregnant woman, Taliatu Alli, on Monday in Iseyin, Oyo State, approached the court seeking the dissolution of her two-year-old marriage over abandonment. Taliatu, who claimed to be eight months pregnant, alleged that Alli had been behaving irrationally since she became pregnant. “We prayed to have the baby, I’m surprised that Alli has neglected me and the baby. “It is also surprising he can become so irresponsible. He comes home only when he wishes. Whenever I asked him for money for anti-natal and other necessary medications he will turn it down,” she told a customary court. She added: “He has been punishing me since I became pregnant as if it is a bad thing to be pregnant. “I need to move on in life so that people do not think I have a husband when in reality I do not have one.” Alli, however, told the court that he could not provide for her needs because he had no money. “I know I have not been giving her money as expected but I still give her the little I have and I expect her to understand. “The major problem with her is that she is too troublesome,” he said. He pleaded with the court not to dissolve the marriage, saying he prefers an amicable resolution of the issues. The President of the court, Chief Adelodun Raheem, said the union was still redeemable and ordered the families of the
estranged couple to intervene. He adjourned the case until Sept.14 for report of the settlement.  NAN
