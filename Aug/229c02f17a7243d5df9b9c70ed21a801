An unnamed Russian club is a front-runner to sign FK Ventspils’ striker Adeleke Akinyemi, after his goal-scoring run in the UEFA Europa League qualifiers. The striker scored a total of seven goals in the Europa League, including a strike against French Ligue 1 side Bordeaux with Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr in the stands. This has generated a lot of interest from several top clubs from across Europe. “He is wanted by several clubs, but a top Russian club is in pole position to get him as they have so far, made the highest bid for him – a million Euros,” a source told SCORENigeria “This is far in excess of his release clause of 300,000 Euros. And his contract lapses in 2020.” The little known Nigerian striker sensationally went AWOL after he alleged his Latvian club was forcing him to sign a contract extension so that they could cash in big time on his departure.
