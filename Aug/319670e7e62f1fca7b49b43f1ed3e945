Despite yesterday came for a three-year-old boy said to have suffered several physical abuses from his grandmother. It was gathered that a rights group that learnt of his predicament, has offered to  educate him up to university level. The victim, Stephen, was said to have been abandoned by his mother after he was born at Osayemi Street in Ogba in the care of his unnamed grandmother. An artist, Didi Moon, had on Tuesday posted on social media, pictures of violent marks on the child’s body, said to have been inflicted on him by the grandma. He wrote: “On my way to the studio, I entered a shop to buy bottled water and I met people talking about this small boy. The story was that his mother abandoned him for his grandmother and the grandma has been abusing this poor innocent young soul. “The boy looks weak and traumatised. He had not eaten anything since morning until around 2:45pm, the time I saw him. I heard the grandma just hit his head and chest on the concrete because he pooed on his cloth. When they pulled his shirt, I saw these scars all over his back and even on his stomach…” Moon told The Nation that the rights group and individuals had visited the child, adding that some of them brought groceries and other food items. He said a group also pledged to sponsor the child’s education, adding that neighbours were asked to keep an eye on the grandmother and report any abuse on the kid. “I have contacted officials of the government but I have not seen them yet. Some non-governmental organisations (NGOs) came on Thursday to check on the kid. He’s such an intelligent child. One of the groups promised full scholarship for the boy till university,” he said.
