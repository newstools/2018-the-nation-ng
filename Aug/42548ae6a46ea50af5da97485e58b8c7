A 34-year-old businessman, Chika Ihemeje, was yesterday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court for allegedly obtaining goods worth N900,000 under false pretence. Ihemeje is facing trial on a four-count charge of fraud and issuance of dud-cheque. Prosecuting Sergeant Friday Mameh said the accused committed the offence between April and August 9, last year, at Orile Coker. He said Ihemeje obtained white cement worth N900,000 from the complainant, Mr Munachi Okeakpu. Ihemeje, he said, promised to remit proceeds from the goods to the complainant’s account after sales but he failed. Mameh said the accused, converted the proceeds into his own use. “When the accused was approached for the money, he issued two First City Monument Bank cheques for the sum of N400,000 and N300, 000 respectively in favour of the complainant. “But the cheques were rejected on presentation at the bank due to insufficient funds in the account of the accused,” Mameh said. According to the prosecutor, the offences contravened Sections 280 (1) (a)(b), 314 (1) and 321(b) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The accused pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Y.O. Aro-Lambo granted the accused N500, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The sureties, he said, must show evidence of tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Their addresses will also be verified by the prosecutor. The case continues on September 27.
