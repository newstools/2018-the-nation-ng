Senate President Bukola Saraki yesterday condemned alleged last minute cancellation of the approval granted to Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso to use the Eagle Square, Abuja for his presidential declaration In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Yusuph Olaniyonu, in Abuja, Saraki said: “Eagle Square belongs to all Nigerians. The cancellation sends a wrong message about the tolerance level in our politics. “The refusal to allow Senator Kwankwaso use the Eagle Square for his presidential declaration, despite an earlier approval, sends a wrong message about our democracy, particularly the tolerance level in our politics. “That square belongs to all Nigerians because it was built with public funds. We hope this is not what we will be seeing as we approach the 2019 general election.”
