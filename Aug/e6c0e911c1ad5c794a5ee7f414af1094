Scores of youths from the six local government areas in the Southern Senatorial district of Ondo State have defected from the Labour Party (LP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The youths were received by the State Chairman, Ade Adetimehin, who was at the venue in Irele, headquarters of Irele Local Government area. The chairman represented by his deputy, Agabra Atili, congratulated them for taking a wise decision, and assured them of proper integration. Adetimehin urged them to put their request into paper and send it to the State Secretariat for consideration. He explained that President Muhammadu Buhari was laying sound infrastructural and economic foundation for a better and prosperous future, adding that same was being replicated in Ondo State, under Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu. The exercise was facilitated by the representative of the senatoral district at the Upper Chamber of the National Assembly, Senator Yele Omogunwa. The decampees decried what they called “gross neglect” by the LP, which they adduced as the crux of their annoyance, and subsequent defection. Facilitator of the defection, Omogunwa said he had the opportunity of meeting and discussing with leaders of some of the groups and observed they are vibrant and articulate. Omogunwa said “There is the need to integrate as many as possible into our Party, to ensure electoral success in the next general elections. Mimiko is a deft politician, so the more we are able to pull out of the Labour Party, the better for us in 2019”. The Coordinator of the Aviary Youth Vanguard, Coastal Region, Oluwarotimi Omoge, said they decided to join the APC because of the sincerity of President Muhammadu Buhari. Omoge, appealed to the State leadership of the party to concede to members of the groups  councillorship positions in their respective political wards.
