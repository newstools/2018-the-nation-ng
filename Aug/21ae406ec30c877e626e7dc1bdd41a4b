The Rivers State Government said yesterday that Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is unfair to Governor Nyesom Wike with the comment credited to him that Sokoto State Governor Aminu Tambuwal left the APC and joined the PDP because of the promise of presidential ticket which Wike made to him. A statement yesterday by Commissioner for Information and Communications Emma Okah, said “Governor Wike has not discussed the political ambition of Governor Tambuwal with Senator Tinubu and so Senator Tinubu cannot rely on mere rumour to speak unfairly about the governor in the way he did” Okah said Tambuwal is a mature adult with the capacity to take critical political decisions for himself without Wike’s prompting.
