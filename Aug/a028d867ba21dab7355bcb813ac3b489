Akwa Ibom State Governor, Udom Emmanuel, has sacked the state Commissioner for Labour, Productivity and Manpower Development, Mr. Ibanga Akpabio and his Ministry of Culture and Tourism counterpart, Mr. Victor Antai, from the state Executive Council. The commissioners’ sack takes immediate effect. The duo have been asked to hand over to the Permanent Secretary in their respective ministries before close of work on Wednesday. Ibanga is a younger brother to ex-governor of the state, Godswill Akpabio, who is reportedly moving to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The state Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr. Charles Udoh, said the two commissioners were sacked for alleged “gross misconduct and non-compliance with public service rules.”
