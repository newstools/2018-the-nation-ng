The Branch Chairman of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, (LAUTECH) Ogbomoso, Mr Biodun Olaniran has said the institution will collapse if the owner states refuses to fund it. Olaniran who stated this while speaking with our correspondent said the major problem LAUTECH is facing is lack of proper funding and timely release of subvention. “Efforts have been made by our officials to reach an agreement with the school management as to solve the looming strike over the university, but all what the university management are all saying is that the matter is getting government attention but am sure that very soon the government would do the needful. “We appeal to the two governments to the needful and they shouldn’t play with education.  They should take it serious so that they won’t jeopardize the future of the future leaders to be. “The school management should also be able to keep themselves on toes and look for a way out to the predicament of the varsity,” the ASUU Chairman said. Over the years, LAUTECH has been encountering reoccurring strike due to lack of proper funding by the owner states which has resulted in students dropping out of school.
