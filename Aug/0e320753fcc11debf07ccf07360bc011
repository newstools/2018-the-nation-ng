Former Nigerian professional footballer, Joseph Yobo has enjoined civil society groups, party forerunners to intensify efforts in mobilising Nigerians to collect their Permanent Voters Card (PVC) before the closing date of August 31.
He made the appeal at a recent one-day rally organised by Grassroots Mobilization Initiative (GMI) at Saint George Primary School, Ikoyi Lagos State.
The former Everton defender said that the acquisition of the PVCs was crucial in keying into the country’s electoral process with a view to electing credible leaders during the 2019 elections.
“We are here to sensitise the public on the importance of getting their Permanent Voters’ Card (PVC), because that is the only power they have to elect trust worthy and credible leaders in power. Your vote is your constitutional right, so don’t deny yourself,” he said.
The National Executive Director, Planning and Organising Mr Ayo Faseke said the program was organised to sensitize Nigerians on the power of their PVCs and encourage them to go and register despite the complaints that more INEC personnel should be on ground for the exercise.
He added that this is the second time the pressure group is holding such an event in the country and it intends to host two more rallies before expiration of the PVC registration.
The event was powered by Nigeria’s most capped player and former captain, Joseph Yobo who is a promoter and brand ambassador for the group.
He advised that voters should not to sell their votes and only vote for candidates of their choices.
