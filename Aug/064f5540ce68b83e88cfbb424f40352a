The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Yaklabbs Petroleum Nigeria Ltd, Mrs Christy Tafida, was yesterday brought before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court for alleged N35 million fraud. She was arraigned with her company on a three-count charge of conspiracy, obtaining under false pretence, issuance of dud cheques and fraud before Chief Magistrate Afolashade Botoku. Prosecuting Superintendent of Police Chukwu Agwu said Tafida and unnamed accomplices committed the offences between August 2015 and 2017 at Dolphin Estate, Ikoyi, Lagos. The defendants, the court heard, collected N35million from a firm, Virtue-One Global Investment Ltd, represented by Mr Peters Udeagu. They allegedly issued cheques as repayment for the loan, but the cheques were dishonoured due to insufficient funds. The offence, the prosecutor said, contravened Sections 314 (a) (b) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The defendants pleaded not guilty. Their counsel, Mr Augustine Okechukwu, applied for Tafida’s bail “on liberal terms.” He said the defendant and complainant were holding talks to resolve the issue. “The complainant has already been paid N10 million out of the money and there are responsible sureties that can stand for her if granted bail,” Okechukwu added. But the prosecutor objected, saying the court that the defendants were charged with the offence because of Tafida’s “antecedent”. According to him, Tafida had evaded the complainant for two years. Agwu said: “Her antecedent made us to come to court. For the past two years we couldn’t find her, as she is not within jurisdiction. The address she gave at Ajah, when we visited there, she wasn’t there, as she has sold the house. She now lives in Abuja at an undisclosed address.” Chief Magistrate Botoku granted the defendants N2 million bail each, with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on September 27.
