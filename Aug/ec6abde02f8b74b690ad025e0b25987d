The police in Ekiti on Sunday directed all Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers in the state to beef up security in their areas of jurisdiction. The Commissioner of Police in the state, Bello Ahmed, gave the directive in a statement issued in Ado-Ekiti by the command’s spokesman, DSP Caleb Ikechukwu. Ahmed, who said the command was determined to ensure safety of lives and property during the Sallah celebration, also ordered the deployment of policemen to all Eid praying grounds across the state. He warned criminals to steer clear of the state during the Eid-el-Kabir celebration, saying those caught in criminal activities would face the full weight of the law. The commissioner said the state’s highway and anti-crime patrol teams had been deployed to ensure safety of lives and property. Ahmed, however, warned officers deployed to be civil, polite and firm in carrying out their duties. He also enjoined residents to be security conscious, vigilant and report any incident to the nearest police station or call the Special Emergency Control Unit on 08072335577. In the same vein, the Sector Commander of the FRSC in the state, Ismaila Kugu, told NAN that measures had been put in place to ensure a hitch-free Sallah celebration. He warned against dangerous driving, overloading, speed-limit violation and driving without the necessary documents. The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, on its part, said it would work with other sister agencies to ensure a crime-free celebration in the state. The spokesman of the corps in the state, Tope Afolabi, told NAN that the command would also ensure the safety of critical public infrastructure. (NAN)
