For July, Mrs Adeosun said N714.809 billion was shared among the Federal, States and local government and beneficiaries of the 13 per cent derivation. This is lower than the N812 billion shared for June.

N25.027 billion was shared as proceeds of Forex Equalization, and N12 billion was additional funds from the NNPC to the federation account.
