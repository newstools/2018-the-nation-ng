The Acting National Chairman of the Youth Party (YP), Mr. Suleiman Yusuf, has said  the party will give opportunities to youths to make their contributions to the development of the country. He said the youths have been marginalised for long, noting that the newly-registered party would break the barrier that has kept the youth on the back seat. Yusuf added that the YP was compelled to seek registration from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), following the hurdles faced by youths because they wanted to serve their fatherland. The Acting National Chairman, who expressed optimism after receiving the party’s registration certificate from INEC in Abuja, said Nigerians irrespective of age were free to contest election for any position under the platform. He said: “Let me say that this is not a party for moneybags. We are set to expand the restrictive democratic space through transparent political leadership and followership. The YP will eschew money politics, bribery, violence, rigging and corruption. “The party’s ideals and policies will focus on developing and improving the standard of living of Nigerians. The party aims to rebuild Nigeria through generational change in political leadership.” Yusuf maintained that the YP has offices in 28 states of the federation, including Abuja, stressing that with 5,664 members, the party was set to break new grounds. He said the party was not founded by career politicians, but by people of different backgrounds noted for their moral ideological goals. “The cardinal agenda of the YP which include quality basic education, universal healthcare, social housing and commitment to internal democracy will give Nigerians the opportunity to express themselves and determine the Nigeria of their dream.”
