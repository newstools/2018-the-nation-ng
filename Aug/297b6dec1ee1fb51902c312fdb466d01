Cristiano Ronaldo says the decision to leave Real Madrid for Juventus in Italy after nine trophy-filled years in Spain was an easy one to make. The 33-year-old joined the Italian champions last month on a four-year deal, ending a stint in Spain that saw him win two La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League trophies. “It was an easy decision. What was done in Madrid is incredible, I won everything, my family lives there, but it’s part of the past,” Ronaldo told sports streaming service DAZN. Juventus paid 100 million euros ($114.37 million) to sign Ronaldo, who made his Serie A debut in their 3-2 win at Chievo last Sunday.
