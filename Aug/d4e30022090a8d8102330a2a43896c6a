Members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Kwara led by state Chairman Mr Iyiola Oyedepo, on Wednesday announced their defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Chief  Rex Olawoye, the erstwhile Publicity Secretary of the party,  made this known to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin. “I hereby officially announce the exit of our members from PDP to APC,” he said. Olawoye, who described  Senate President  Bukola Saraki as an “anathema,”  said PDP members in the state could not work with him. NAN reports that Saraki formally announced his exit from the APC on Tuesday. Olawoye said with the defection,  all political structures of the PDP at the ward, local government and state levels had moved to the APC. The spokesman appealed to all party members to maintain peace and orderliness in their conduct and behaviour. “Unity is the primary ingredient that can make those of us coming from the PDP and leftover of  APC members to live in harmony,” he added. He said Oyedepo had met with the leadership of the PDP in Abuja and explained the resolve of party members not to work with Saraki. Olawoye also said the chairman met with the national leadership of APC,  including the National Chairman, Adams Oshiomole, Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, as well as other chieftains of the APC. He added that the defecting PDP members were warmly welcomed into the APC  by the party’s leadership. “Saraki and his cronies have been in the saddle of  leadership of the state in the past 15 years with nothing to show for it,’’ he said. Olawoye called on all registered political parties in the state to team up with the APC to ensure the total liberation of the state
