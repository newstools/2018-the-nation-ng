The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) yesterday injected $210 million into the inter-bank Foreign Exchange (forex) Market. The move was meant to boost forex availability and also meet customers’ requests in various segments of the market. At the forex trading, the CBN offered $100 million to authorised dealers in the wholesale segment of the market, while the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) segment received $55 million. Customers requiring foreign exchange for invisibles, such as tuition fees, medical payments and Basic Travel Allowance (BTA), among others, were also allocated $55 million. The bank’s Acting Director, Corporate Communications Department (CCD), Isaac Okorafor, confirmed the figures and reassured the public that the bank would continue to intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market in line with its quest to sustain liquidity in the market and maintain stability. He added that the steps taken so far by the bank in the management of forex had paid off, as reflected by reduction in the country’s import bills and accretion to its foreign reserves. Meanwhile, the naira exchange rate remained stable in the forex market, exchanging at an average of N360/$1 in the BDC segment of the market on Tuesday.
