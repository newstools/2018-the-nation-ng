A 17-year-old girl, Ramatu Tafida, has cut off the manhood of her 25-year-old boyfriend, Abdullahi Sabo, in Jigawa State. The spokesman of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence (NSCDC), Adamu Shehu, disclosed this in Dutse on Saturday. He said the incident occurred in Babura local government area of the state. Shehu said the victim is a resident of Kofar Gabas and a teacher at Government Girls Secondary School Babura engaged under N-Power. “The incident occurred on Thursday in Babura. The attention of our officers was drawn by a Good Samaritan who informed them that some youths were about to lynch a girl in Kofar Arewa, the resident of the suspect, to revenge for their friend. “Immediately the officers swung into action and went to the scene and whisked the girl away to the office for safety. But the youths still followed her. “It was when they got to the office that we realised what led to the whole matter. “Ramlatu confessed to have used a knife to cut off the manhood of her husband-to-be. “According to her, Abdullahi is the love of her life and he was even introduced to her family members and has equally paid the sum of N30,000 as introduction fee. “And because of that, she was free to be with him almost all the time. As a result they became too intimate that they engaged in sexual relationship. “However, Ramlatu later learnt that the victim planned to dump her for another girl since he has already known her as a woman. And that made her to plan and execute her attack,” he said. NAN
