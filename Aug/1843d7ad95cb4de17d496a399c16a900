Nigerians have been advised to vote in God fearing leaders in 2019 by voting according to their conscience. The Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Rev. Alfred Martins, who addressed reporters during the 2018 Catholic Men Organisation (CMO), Lagos Archdiocese convention, said “Nigerians should use their conscience to vote in the kind of leaders they deserve”. The cleric added that “Nigeria is in a dilemma, a state of economic woes and insecurity because Nigerians failed to use their votes to bring in good leaders”. The Lagos Catholic Archdiocese will start a monthly prayer session which will hold every last Friday of the month in all Churches under diocese towards the success of the 2019 elections. This is the church’s own way of praying for peace and credible conduct of the polls,” he added. The Catholic Bishops of Nigeria, to maintain decorum in the church, have also banned public endorsement of politicians ahead of the election. It sent out a circular to all religious and faithful in all Catholic Churches in Nigeria to avoid endorsing any candidate or political party, but to educate members to collect their Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) and vote according to their conscience. President of CMO John Aigbohoade said “the three-day 2018 annual convention was geared at praying together for our family and the country”. One thousand and six hundred members were on Sunday inducted by the Archbishop of Lagos, Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins during the induction ceremony Mass hels at St. Gregory’s College, Ikoyi, on Sunday.
