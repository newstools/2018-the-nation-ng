The Special Adviser on Civic Engagement to Lagos State Governor, Benjamin Olabinjo has urged Lagosians to participate in the on-going Permanent Voters Card (PVC) registration exercise, noting that it is their only power to re-elect Governor Akinwunmi Ambode in 2019. Olabinjo gave the advice when he received Team ‘A’ Plus Volunteers’ Area Coordinators. He said: ”I want to thank you for this great initiative to sensitise our people on the need to register and collect their PVCs before the registration window closes on August 27, because your PVC is your power , strength and voice.” The team’s leader, Mrs Modupe Makewu said her team would ensure adequate mobilisation and awareness for the exercise, saying: ”for us to demonstrate our support for Governor Ambode, we are pleading with our people to go and pick their PVCs.”
