The running battle between the Police and Senator Dino Melaye may be far from over. Melaye on Friday accused the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command of refusing to  release his international passport as ordered by the court. He said  that on July 25th, 2018, an Abuja Chief Magistrate Court ordered the Police to release his international passport to him following “a notice of discontinuance” filed by the prosecution in respect of charge  “No: CR/12/18” against him at  Magistrate Court Wuse Zone 2, Abuja. The Kogi West senator claimed that “the fragrant refusal of the Police to comply with the court order” to release his international passport amounts to contempt of court. He said that letters his lawyers wrote to the Police to retrieve the passport were not honoured by the FCT Police Command. He noted that apart from the letters, his lawyer also went personally to the Police to retrieve the passport to no avail. Melaye who said that the Police earlier set a precedent when they released his passport to enable him go for medical treatment abroad, wondered what made the July 25th, 2018 order difficult for them to comply with. He said: “If a law enforcement agency will be the one breaking the law, how do you enforce the law? In a country under the rule of law, if an order of the court is given release this man’s passport, why would the court order not be obeyed. This buttresses the fact that the Police is still after me. “Since April 22nd, 2018 the Police withdrew my orderly. No politician has been so humiliated the way and manner I have been humiliated. The Police is still looking for me to arrest me over what I don’t know. “I want to restate that the Police can only kill and injure the flesh, they cannot kill the spirit. I remain strong.”
