A 37-year-old-man, Jephath Ighodaro was yesterday arraigned before an Ogba Magistrates’ Court for allegedly having sex with his own twins’ sons. Ighodalo, who is the founder of Purple Foundation, a non-governmental organisation, and lives at Saint Augustine Street, Orisunmbare, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge before Magistrate P.E. Nwaka. The police alleged that Ighodalo penetrated his sons through the anus. The incident was said to have happened between January and July. According to police, Ighodalo was arrested after his wife filed a complaint against him that he allegedly sodomised their boys. Ighodalo was alleged to have withdrawn the children from their school in March 2016 following his separation from his wife the previous year. He was alleged to have been abusing the children by penetrating their anuses and forcing them suck his manhood. The police said his wife became suspicious when the twins went for a weekend at their mother’s place and fondled her breasts. When she enquired from them, the kids allegedly told her their father had been sodomising them. The defendant pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Nwaka adjourned the case till September 3.
