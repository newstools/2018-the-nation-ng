Nigeria coach Christopher Danjuma has backed his team to reach the final of the ongoing Women’s U-20 World Cup in France. The Falconets claimed a dramatic 1-1 draw with China on Monday, a result which secured qualification for the quarterfinals as runners-up in Group D behind Germany. Danjuma now believes his team has the character and strength to reach the third final after the feats of 2010 and 2014. Nigeria will face Group C winners Spain in Concarneau on Thursday for a place in the final four, and Danjuma is backing the African side to make more history. “Our ambition is to enjoy reaching another final. We want to be in the final, and the records are in our favour to do so after we did so in 2010 and 2014. And this is now 2018,” said the Falconets’ coach. “It was a hard-fought game thanks to the great character and mentality of my players. You could also say we were lucky, but everything has an element of favour. “You can work hard, but you also need some luck. The best wishes of Nigerians also helped us and we are grateful to God.” The other quarterfinal match-ups are France v North Korea, England v Netherlands and Germany v Japan.
