Governor Darius Dickson Ishaku on Tuesday reminded Muslims that peace remains the most critical need in Nigeria especially in Taraba State where many residents have died and thousands displaced from their ancestral homes to crisis. He spoke in a statement while rejoicing with Muslims on the Eid-el-Kabir. “I wish all Muslims a happy, peaceful and delightful Eid-el-Kabir celebration,” the statement said. The governor’s Sallah felicitation message was delivered by his Senior Special Assistant (SSA) on Media and Publicity, Bala Dan Abu. “I rejoice with the Muslim Ummah in Taraba State as they join their counterparts in Nigeria and all over the world to mark this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. “Peace remains the most critical need of the state and this can only be achieved and sustained if the people remain united against the agents of destabilisation; against those who are bent on causing breakdown of law and order in the land,” the governor said. Ishaku prayed for “Allah’s abundant blessings and benevolence upon Nigerians.” He thank God for the gift of life, and reminded Sallah celebrants of the need for them to continue to work very hard for peace in Taraba and the country. The governor re-assured them of government’s commitment to his “rescue agenda” which he noted, has already impacted positively in job creation and skills acquisition and also led to an unprecedented improvements in WAEC scores by Taraba students. “The provision of water to more than 250 communities, renovation and re-equipment of major hospitals in the state and construction of major roads in the three senatorial zone etc, are only a few of the numerous achievements my administration has put in place. “In the years ahead, a lot more will be done in terms of service delivery and in support of the welfare of the people. Let me urge all indigenes and non-indigenes of the state to continue to support this administration.”
