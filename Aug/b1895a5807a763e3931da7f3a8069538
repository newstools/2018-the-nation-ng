Youths in Ondo state have been charged to actively participate in politics and be part of stakeholders in the decision-making to overhaul the future of the country. The state chairman of the Social Democratic Party(SDP), Korede Duyile, gave the charge at the official declaration of a youth leader, Tajudeen Adefisoye for the seat of Idanre/Ifedore Federal Constituency in the 2019 election. Duyile said the masses were tired of voting the old set of people with the same ideology. The chairman said SDP was on ground and most people that had shown interest in various positions were from notable and credible families that were well known to him as an indigene of Idanre himself. He said “Our membership is already increasing in Idanre and in the state, more people are seeing our party as a credible platform,especially the youths, to fulfil their dreams”. Adefisoye, who is in his mid-thirties, said he decided to run on the platform of SDP, because it had plans to allow youths to seek political positions. Adefisoye said he decided to be part of the real change and liberate the people of Idanre and Ifedore by bringing meaningful development to the constituency. According to him,” I am already assured of victory,there is no development in this town, we can’t be sending same old men to be representing us always.” The Aspirant was later presented with the flag of the party and urged to continue promoting the party within and outside the state.
