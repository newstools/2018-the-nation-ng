The police in Nasarawa State have begun investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of one person at Ashangwa Market after Tuesday’s pandemonium. The spokesman, Samaila Usman, at a news conference yesterday, said the police on Tuesday received reports that some people disrupted activities in the market which led to the death of one person while three others were injured. He said: “Preliminary investigation showed that one person was killed and his body burnt and buried by unidentified persons. The three others who sustained injuries are receiving treatment at an undisclosed hospital in Lafia.” Usman added that no arrest has been made yet while policemen have been deployed in the area to restore peace. An eyewitness said problem started when some groups were celebrating Eid. He said: “They started the trouble among themselves and it spread to other parts of the market, so everybody ran. It was later in the day that we got information that one person was killed while those who sustained injuries were taken to the hospital.”
