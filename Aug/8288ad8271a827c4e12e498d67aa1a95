The Niger Government is spending about N3 billion on the reconstruction of 74-kilometre Minna – Suleja federal road, the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure Development, Alhaji Ibrahim Balarabe, has said. Balarabe disclosed this in an interview with Newsmen in Minna on Thursday. He said that the state government had embarked on reconstructing the road because of its significance to the socio-economic and political growth of the state. ‘‘It is a Federal Government’s road but as a responsible government, we need to repair the road. ‘‘There is need for political commitment to put the road in proper condition for the benefit of people plying the road. ‘‘I am very pleased with the level of job so far executed as the project has reached 70 per cent completion,’’ he said. He emphasised that the project, when completed, would enhance commercial activities in the state. The commissioner urged heavy truck drivers to complement the effort of the state government by desisting from overloading and obeying traffic rules and regulations. He said it was only by so doing that the life-span of the road would be increased.
