A 25-year-old man, Musa Olumade, who had previously pleaded guilty to breaking into several houses and was sentenced to six months of community service, was on Monday again brought before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court on a similar charge. Olumade is facing a five-count charge bordering on conspiracy, burglary, unlawful entry and theft. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge and was admitted to bail in the sum of N50, 000 with one surety in like sum. The prosecutor, ASP Fidelis Dike, told the court that the accused committed the offences on July 23, at Alarape Street, Langbasa, Ajah, Lagos. He said that the accused conspired with others now at large to break into 12 houses, with the intent to steal. Dike added that the accused broke into the houses of Stephen Kogbe, Adewale Ashafa and Akeem Adeleke, and stole their phones, all valued at N160,000. “The accused, who was sentenced to six months community service on Feb. 3, went back to commit similar offences just twenty days after he finished his community service sentence. “Olumide was apprehended while his accomplices escaped,’’ Dike said. The offences contravened Sections 287, 307 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Section 287 provides for three years imprisonment, Section 307 stipulates seven years imprisonment, while Section 411 prescribes two years imprisonment for convicted offenders. The Magistrate, Mr Kazeem Omolaja, said that the accused must provide a surety who is gainfully employed and should be his blood relation. He adjourned the case until Aug. 16, for mention.
