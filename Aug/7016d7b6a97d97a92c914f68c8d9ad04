A young Barcelona fan was left in tears as he finally got the chance to meet his idol, Lionel Messi. The club posted a video of the Argentine superstar stopping to pose for photos with fans at the airport following Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Real Valladolid. And one supporter was unable to contain his excitement, bursting in to tears as Messi approached him and signed his shirt. The youngster looked overwhelmed as he watched his fellow fans receive their autographs before getting one of his own. Barcelona’s talisman acknowledged the show of support, rubbing the child’s head before moving on to greet the rest of the club’s loyal followers. The Catalan outfit have made a solid start to the season with Saturday’s victory making it two wins in two in La Liga. Ousmane Dembele scored the only goal as the reigning La Liga champions survived a late VAR scare to claim a hard-fought win at the  Estadio Jose Zorrilla Dembele struck just before the hour after spurning several chances but the hosts would not lie down and almost snatched a last-gasp point. Keko thought he had equalised in added time but his header was eventually ruled out for offside after intervention by the video assistant referee. The child looked overwhelmed after meeting his idol following Barcelona’s La Liga victory. Messi who failed in his desire to lead Argentina beyond the group of 16 in Russia, has regained his super form for his club as they eye addition to their 25 league titles already in the kitty.
