The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission( EFCC) is set for the trial of a former Managing Director of Societe Generale Bank of Nigeria( SGBN), Mr. Robert Mbonu and three others for alleged conversion of N3.5billion of N19billion London-Paris Club refund to states. The others are Melrose General Services Limited, the Senate President Deputy Chief of Staff Mr. Gbenga Makanjuola and Obiora Amobi. No date has been fixed for the trial of the suspects at a Federal High Court in Lagos. But the whereabouts of one of the suspects were unknown as at yesterday, leading to a delay in their arraignment. The EFCC said it might declare the affected suspect wanted. Makanjuola has been reporting to the EFCC to clear his name, insisting that he never stole NGF’s cash. Following protests by states over deductions for external debt service between 1995 and 2002, President Muhammadu Buhari approved the release of N522.74 billion (first tranche) refund to them, pending reconciliation of records. Each state was entitled to N14.5 billion or 25 per cent of the amount claimed. The release of the cash was  trailed by a huge controversy, including payment of N19billion consultancy fees and $86million into the accounts of the NGF. The EFCC in the last two years has been  investigating the alleged diversion of the N19billion under the guise of consultancy fees,  including the N3.5billion, which was allegedly remitted to Melrose General Services Limited, allegedly with links to Mbonu. About $183,000 of the N3.5billion was transferred to a Dubai jeweler patronised by some senators. In the charges against the suspects, the EFCC said there was no service rendered to have warranted the payment of the N3.5billion. The charges read in part: “That you Robert Chidozie Mbonu, Melrose General Services Limited and other persons at large on or about the 14th day of December, 2016 in Lagos within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court conspired amongst yourselves to disguise the unlawful origin of the sum of N3.5billion paid into the account of Melrose General Services Limited and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 18 of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 (as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012) and punishable under section 15 (3) of the same Act. “That you Robert Chidozie Mbonu and Melrose General Services Limited  having reason to know that N3.5billion  directly represented the proceeds of your unlawful activity to wit: Conspiracy and Stealing: did convert the said funds which you received from the Nigeria Governors Forum under the false guise that you were entitled to payment of consultancy fees from money recovered for the states in relation to “over-deductions on Paris and London club loans on the account of the states and local government (1995-2002)” which service you did not render and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 15(2) (b) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 (as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012) and punishable under section 15 (3) of the same Act. “That you Robert Chidozie Mbonu and Melrose General Services Limited on or about the 14th December, 2016 in Lagos within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did retain in the Access Bank Plc Account No. 0005892453 operated by Melrose General Services Limited the sum of N3, 500,000,000.00 received from the Nigeria Governors Forum when you reasonably ought to know that the said money was a direct proceed of your unlawful activity to wit Conspiracy and Stealing: and thereby committed an offence contrary to section 15(2) ((1) 0f the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 (as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012) and punishable under section 15 (3) of the same Act. “That you Robert Chidozie Mbonu and Melrose General Services Limited on or about the 20th of December, 2015 in Lagos wihln the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court did transfer the sum 0f N50m being part of N3.5billion which represented the direct proceed of your unlawful activity to wit: (Conspiracy and Stealing) to Gbenga Makanjuola and thereby committed an offence contrary to Section 15(2) (b) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 (as amended by Act No. 1 of 2012) and punishable under section 15 (3) of the same Act.
