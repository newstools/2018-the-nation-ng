NAIROBI-BASED The Purpose Centre Church has hosted the first East African edition of Nigerian Gospel singer Freke Umoh’s NOW concert series. According to the combined team of Nigerian and Kenyan organizers, the turn out overtook their target. With Freke Umoh on the trip from Nigeria were Kaydee Numbere, the hilife prophet, Precious Emmanuel, Wisdom K and Enkay of the Alabanza concerts. The event was just like the marketers caption it – East-Meets-West of African Worship as some indigenous Kenyan singers also shared the stage with the Nigerian artistes. Reacting after the concert, the Kenyans welcomed a repeat of the project, which will include a gospel music workshop to explore both West and East African cultures. Freke Umoh’s expedition towards East Africa began in 2017 when he wrote ‘Mungu Wangu’, a worship song in Swahili and co-performed it with Kenyan choir, Voices of Purpose. The song was nominated for the America-based Sauti Awards within weeks of being released under the Best Worship Song category. On his return from Nairobi, his team announced that preparations for the annual Uyo edition of his NOW concert in November will slide into advanced mode.
