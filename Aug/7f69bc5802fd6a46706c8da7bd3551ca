Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode yesterday gave out N25million to over 250 members of the Lagos State Council of the Nigerian Legion. He also presented welfare materials to widows and orphans of ex-servicemen, disabled and aged ex-service men at an empowerment programme held at the Safety Arena premises of the Legionnaires at Oshodi. Items given out to the beneficiaries who came from the 57 councils in the state included cash, sewing and grinding machines, generators, gas cylinder/cooker, standing fans, fabrics, bags of rice and semolina. Ambode, represented by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs, Dr. Toyin Awoseyi, said the empowerment “is to show appreciation to families of our fallen heroes, as well as the disabled and aged ex-servicemen, who have contributed immensely to the sovereignty of Nigeria.” He implored the beneficiaries to use the materials well to augment their other earnings. “Let us show appreciation by extending adequate support and facilities for the benefit of the veterans and families of our fallen heroes. Above all let us join hands with the government in improving their welfare,” he said. The Council Chairman, Samuel Akande, said the governor had been supportive of the Legion since his assumption of office. “In 2015, he donated N1 million, in 2016 he donated N5milliin, 2017, N25million, you can guess what his Excellency will do this year in support of the cause of the widows, orphans, disabled and aged ex-servicemen,” he said.
