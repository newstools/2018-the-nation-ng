The Police on Wednesday arraigned a 27-year-old man, Babayo Ahmed, in a Karu Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, for allegedly purchasing stolen wrappers worth N100,000. The defendant, a resident of Dutse Alhaji, in the FCT, was arraigned on a count charge bordering on receiving stolen property, an offence he denied committing. The prosecutor, Mr Vincent Osuji, told the court that the defendant intentionally bought the wrappers from the person who stole them. “One Mohammed Hassan of Karu was arrested and brought to Karu Police Station on June 6 for stealing 35 pieces of wrappers, valued at N140,000. “In the course of police investigation, he confessed to have sold 25 pieces of the stolen wrappers, worth N100,000 to the defendant. “The defendant, however, denied the allegation and all efforts to recover the said wrappers proved abortive,” Osuji said. Osuji said that the offence was contrary to and punishable under Section 317 of the Penal Code Law. The judge, Abdulmajeed Oniyangi, admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N250, 000, with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the matter until July 4 for hearing.
