Eagles Captain, Mikel Obi may have been rushed back to fitness from injury for the crucial Argentina game at the ongoing FIFA World Cup in Russia. The 31-year-old sustained a wrist injury during Nigeriaâ€™s 2-0 win over Iceland at the Volgograd Arena on Friday. But the Nigeria midfielder resumed light training on Monday with the national team with a bandage on his wrist. Nigeria are second in Group D and will next face two-time former champions Argentina, who have only point from two games at the St. Petersburg Stadium in a match that will start by 7:pm.
