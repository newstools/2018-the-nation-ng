Politicians, pro democracy group and other political stakeholders unanimously agreed over the weekend that for Nigeria to actually attain full democracy, there is need for proper restructuring of political parties in the country. A former member of the lower chamber of the national assembly, Prince George Jolaoye, who represented Ayedire/Ola-Oluwa/Iwo federal constituency of Osun State, led the call. He spoke at an event organised by the Nigerian Movement for Positive Change (NMPC), held at Alice Palace, Agodi Street, Ibadan. He said: “This restructuring must first take place within the political parties. It is sad to say that most of our political parties lack proper political ideology. In the USA, and Britain, the foundations of their political parties are well cemented within established and clearly articulated political ideologies which accentuate the complexion of politics played. In such places, politics is all about ideas.” Another speaker, Senator Gbenga Babalola, charged voters to take their destiny in their hands and exhibit courage to elect political leaders they can vouch for. Babalola said, “No elected person will make Nigeria great, except the voters. Nigerians should wake up and demand accountability from their leaders.” The chairman, Board of Trustees (BoT) of NMPC, General Adekunle Martins (retd), charged political office holders to embark on policies and projects that will truly reflect the welfare of the masses.
