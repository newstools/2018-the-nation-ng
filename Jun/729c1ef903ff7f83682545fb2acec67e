 After four failed attempts, Romanian professional tennis player Simona Halep finally shook off the shackles of her own expectations to clinch a Grand Slam title at the French Open on Saturday. The 26 year-old  came back from a nervy beginning to defeat US Open champion Sloane Stephens 3-6 6-4 6-1 in two hours and three minutes. At 6-3 2-0 it looked like the American’s passable impression of a human wall was going to prove too much for Halep and consign her to a third defeat in the championship match at Roland Garros. But she held it together in the second set before surging to the line in the decider and making her superior pedigree on clay tell. She has now rid herself of the status of being the best women’s player never to have won a Major. Halep said afterwards: ‘In the last game I felt that I could not grip [the racket] anymore, so I just tried not to repeat the last year. I did everything I could. It’s amazing what is happening now. Honestly I can’t believe it. ‘I have been dreaming of this moment since I started to play tennis. I’m really happy that it’s happened in Roland Garros in Paris, my special city. ‘She’s a great player and it’s always tough to play against her. She’s always very strong on the court. When I was down a break in the second set I said: ‘OK, everything is gone. I just have to start to relax and enjoy the match’.’ Having come close in Australia and been unfortunate to lose to Caroline Wozniacki she was a popular winner, having avoided what would have been a crushing defeat. Instead she could listen to the crowd chanting her name as she ran away with it.
