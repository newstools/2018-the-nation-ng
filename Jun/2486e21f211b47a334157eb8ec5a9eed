•Boy gets award A 15-year-old secondary school leaver, Babatimilehin Daomi, has invented a hydraulic-powered, collapsible prototype of the Fourth Mainland Bridge. He said he had also invented a prototype of 100 per cent Nigerian aircraft. Daomi was speaking in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos after being honoured at the 2018 Nigerian Child Summit Award for Inventions and Technology in Lagos. He said he had the skills to invent a number of things that would address some of the nation’s transport, water, electricity and telecommunication challenges. “I want to start with an aircraft that can carry two or four persons. The people that built the first aircraft started with this number. With time, I will build an aircraft that can carry hundreds of persons. I have the skills to do this; I only need financial support from governments, individuals and organisations,” Daomi said. He listed some of his other inventions to include digital mini microscope, DC phone power bank, DC/AC vacuum cleaner and mini radio transmitter. Others are hydrogen separator that powers generator and cooking gas with water. His father, Mr Olusoji Daomi, who is a lawyer, said he had wanted his son to be a lawyer, but would allow him to pursue his dreams in technology. He said his son would be able to do much if supported. The award coordinator, Babalola Omoniyi, told NAN that the award was a platform to identity and celebrate ingenuity in children. Omoniyi said many Nigerian children were doing wonders with their different skills without being recognised, appreciated or encouraged.
