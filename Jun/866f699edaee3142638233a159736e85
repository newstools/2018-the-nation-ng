Founder and general overseer Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) Warrior for Christ Mission, Prophet Dr. Solomon Ajao, (JP), has commended Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for his impressive performance during his first three years in the office. Speaking against the backdrop of the anniversary service, Ambode attended in the chapel at Alausa secretariat on Sunday, Ajao urged Ambode to continue worshipping God regularly and getting close to his maker for direction continually. Commenting on his performance, the prophet said Lagosians should support Ambode to continue his good works in the state by giving him a second term. He said: “Look at developments going on at Berger, Agege and Abule Egba among others. See how he has transformed Lagos state and you will not deny the fact that his performance is enough to earn him a second term ticket.” He advised the Lagos state governor to continue to work hard in the area of security stressing that hoodlums have continue to harass law – abiding citizens who are doing their lawful businesses. Ajao said some criminals have made the railway line area in Fagba, Agbado – Ijaye council area their haven terrorising citizens and breaking into churches to steal phones and other valuables belongings to parishioners. He commended the Divisional Police Officers (DPOs) at Oko Oba, Red House and Iju – Ishaga divisions because their men were usually parading the black spot along the railway line.
