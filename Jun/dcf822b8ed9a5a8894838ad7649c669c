Super Eagles’ technical adviser, Gernot Rohr has admitted that one of the biggest challenges he is facing in arriving at his final list of players for the World Cup is the spate of injuries the team has been riddled with. In the wake of another scary moment, when Tyronne Ebuehi limped out of Monday’s send forth friendly against DR Congo in Port Harcourt, Rohr said the lads must play the remaining two matches with caution. The squad is set to battle England on Saturday at Wembley Stadium and then tango the Czech Republic four days later in Austria, ahead of which Rohr says the players cannot afford to cope with any further knocks. The Franco-German coach is, however, not allowing the situation to dissuade him, as he expressed delight over the impressive showing of his side in the 1-1 draw with DR Congo. While casting a look ahead of his options against England on Saturday, Rohr said: “The game was a good test for the players particularly those who we didn’t know very well. “It was a very good match because we played against a very good team from Congo. They came with a great squad. I am satisfied with the performance of Simy. He is a natural centre-forward. He didn’t have a profile until we found him. We had to see some players who didn’t play so much. Two of them made the team and the pitch was not easy to play on. “We didn’t want to take the risk of playing some players who arrived tired coming from China.”
