•‘Kwara will miss Bolanta’ Kwara State Governor AbdulFatah Ahmed has congratulated Muslim faithful for a successful Ramadan. He urged them to remain connected to love, compassion and generosity. A statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Abdulwahab Oba, said: “As we mark the end of the holy month of Ramadan, let’s remember and pray for our brothers and sisters who were victims of the Offa robbery. Let’s remember their families, friends and associates in our prayers and generosy. “The governor enjoins Muslims to uphold lessons of endurance, perseverance and piety that the holy month teaches to endure the pains inflicted in our hearts by the Offa robbery. “As the country moves toward the 2019 elections, Governor Ahmed urges Nigerians to pray for a peaceful political transition. “He calls for unity and commitment from all stakeholders towards his government’s efforts to ensure equitable distribution of infrastructure and social amenities. “The governor urges everyone to be law-abiding and go about their lawful business peacefully as they celebrate Eid-el-Fitri.” Ahmed has described the late Chairman of the Kwara State All Progressives Congress (APC) Elders’ Forum, Alhaji Suleiman Oba Bolanta, as courageous. He said the party and government would miss the deceased’s contributions to governance and party issues. Ahmed, who visited the bereaved family at their GRA residence in Ilorin, said the deceased will be missed for his leadership, humility, justice and fairness. He urged Bolanta’s relatives to promote his legacies and virtues. The deceased’s eldest son, Solihu Suleiman, thanked Ahmed for his support to the family while their father was alive and since his death. Bolanta died last Saturday after a brief illness. He was 88.
