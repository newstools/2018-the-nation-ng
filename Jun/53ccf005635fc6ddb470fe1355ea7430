Two Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) officers arrested last week in Apapa will be punished for alleged misconduct, Commissioner for the Environment, Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti said yesterday. Oduyomi Oluwakemi with Oracle Number 193886 and Ofoesuwa Oluwayemi – 194375 – were said to have conspired with some traders to display their wares on the road median. The officers, the commissioner said, would be dealt with in accordance with the laws to deter others. Durosinmi-Etti said: “Officers of L AGESC must maintain discipline and integrity in carrying out their duties, as they are ambassadors of the Lagos State Government. The state government has a policy of zero-tolerance on street trading, display of goods on road medians and roadside hawking. The government has given the LAGESC officials the mandate to effectively clamp down on all violators of the environmental laws. It is disheartening to discover that some officers still indulge in manipulating and contravening these laws. It is regrettable that some officers, even after thorough training on how to go about their duties, have decided to disregard their training and flout laid-down rules and regulations.” He said street traders and hawkers were found to be responsible for vandalising and defacing the environment. The commissioner warned LAGESC and other officers in the environment sector to adhere to the public service code of conduct, as government would not hesitate to prosecute anyone found contravening the laws. Durosinmi-Etti urged residents to be wary of overzealous officers or those with dubious character. He asked the public to report the activities of such officers to the ministry.
