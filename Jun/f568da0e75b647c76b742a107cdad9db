The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi, has said education remained the paramount requirement for the nation to achieve all-inclusive development. The monarch spoke during the N2.5 billion endowment fund raising organised by management of Joseph Ayo Babalola University (JABU) in Osun State. Ooni said the future of Nigeria remained in the glory of its youths, stressing that governments at all level must make efforts to facilitate the access to quality education for all young people. The king called on wealthy Nigerians to contribute to provision of quality education across levels, saying the endowment would go a long way in fast-tracking the nation’s development. The Vice-Chancellor (VC), Prof Sola Fajana, said provision of quality education required a tripartite partnership to develop infrastructure and sustain the existing ones. According to the VC, JABU is set to move to next phase of development in bringing modern infrastructure and quality training through for the endowment. Chairman, JABU Endowment Committee and Chief Executive Officer of Mutual Benefit Assurance Plc, Dr Akin Ogunbiyi, explained why the school embarked on the N2.5 billion endowment fund, noting that it was to help the school keep its promise of providing efficient and effective service and knowledge delivery. He said: “With the rise in number of private and public universities in the country, particularly in the Southwest, competition to deliver efficiently has become fierce and JABU needs to keep to its promise to be the model for other school in terms of quality and efficiency.”
