A 23-year-old man, Tolani Faseyi, has been sentenced to 13 months imprisonment without a fine option for burglary. Chief Magistrate A.A. Adetunji handed down the verdict after Faseyi pleaded guilty of the offence. He pleaded guilty to the charges. Prosecuting Inspector Matthew Akhaluode said the convict broke into a house with intent to steal and damage a window valued at N3,000. The convict, he said, committed the offence on May 23 at 7, Lawal Street, Igesun in Ayobo Ipaja, Lagos. The convict, who was first arraigned in court on June 4, conspired with another person now at large to unlawfully gain entry into the room of the complainant, Mrs Elizabeth Lawal, with intent to steal. Akhaluode said in the process of entering the room, the complainantâ€™s window valued at N3, 000 was damaged. He said the convict held the complainant on the neck during the incident. The victim, he said, raised an alarm which attracted neighbours who assisted in apprehending the burglar. The accomplice, he said, escaped through the window.
