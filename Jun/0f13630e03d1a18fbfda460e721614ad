Following a tussle with the Board of Filmhouse and FilmOne Distribution, its CEO, Kene Mkparu, has resigned his position with both companies. The companies confirmed this in a statement released by Filmhouse Cinemas and FilmOne Distribution and Production signed by Kene Okwuosa. “It is with a heavy heart that I announce the decision of the Board of Directors of Filmhouse Cinemas and FilmOne Distribution and Production, to part ways with Mr. Kene Mkparu, in his position as Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of both companies,” according to the statement. “Mr Mkparu, as we all know, was a co-founder of both companies, and instrumental in building them from scratch to becoming the leading cinema chain, theatrical distributor and production company Group in Nigeria. We are most thankful to him for this and for the opportunity to have worked with him. He was and remains a true visionary, and we wish him all the very best in his future endeavours. “Filmhouse and FilmOne are entering a new phase, thus the Board has decided to appoint new Managing Director(s) to steer the affairs of both companies. In the meantime, I, Kene Okwuosa will function as the interim Managing Director of Filmhouse Cinemas and Moses Babatope will function as the Interim Managing Director of FilmOne Distribution and Production, pending the appointment of a substantive Managing Director. “Contrary to some news being peddled in the public domain, the Board wishes to assure everyone that the company is in good health, and there is no cause for alarm.” There has been a rumoured tussle among the top hierarchy of Filmhouse Cinema/FilmOne Distribution, leading to the owners of the company, African Capital Alliance weighing in in the last few months.
