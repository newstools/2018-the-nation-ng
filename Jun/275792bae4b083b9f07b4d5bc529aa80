Wife of Lagos State Governor, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode, yesterday urged Lagosians to keep faith with the current administration and remain supportive of its policies and programmes, expressing optimism that the future will be greater than the past. She spoke at the second edition of Lagos Marathon Praise, a 12-hour song ministration programme, dedicated to thanking God for his mercies on the state and residents, organised by Jubilee Concert International, at Agidingbi, Ikeja. Ambode said it was the duty of a grateful servant to thank God for numerous acts of kindness, adding that when this is done, the state and its people would continue to prosper. According to her, “We had thought deeply about the wonderful acts of God to us as individuals, as a government and as a people; and came to the humble realisation that we owe Him a huge debt of gratitude we can never fully repay, no matter how we try. What we are doing here today is just a mark of gratitude from grateful servants.” Speaking at the event, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, said his administration was grateful to God for the transformation witnessed in the state in the last three years. Ambode, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Education, Mr Obafela Bank-Olemoh, said, “each time I reflect on the level of development our state has experienced within this period, I come to the conclusion that this could not have been possible without God.
