An energy firm, Solar Sister, has announced plans to reduce energy problems in the country. Its Country Manager, Olasimbo Sojinrin, said the firm had succeeded penetrated rural communities without access to electricity. She said one in four people in rural areas was not connected to the national grid. She said: “What we do is find out what energy challenges people have, how they’re cooking, and lighting their homes, and then we proffer solution to them to improve their quality of life. We basically go to these areas, recruit women, train them, and support them to become clean energy ambassadors, entrepreneurs and distributors in their communities. “We have women who distribute solar lamps and clean energy cooking stoves in these areas across the country. In most of these communities, activities cease around 7pm once it goes dark, but with the introduction of these solar lamps, activity and business can be open for longer. They don’t have to remain in perpetual darkness anymore. It has a life changing, transformative effect on the society.” Sojinrin said that Solar Sister has recruited and registered over a thousand women entrepreneurs across 23 states in Nigeria.
