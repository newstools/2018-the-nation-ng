President Muhammadu Buhari said on Friday there is huge resources in the hand of the opposition parties in the country. He said the All Progressives Congress (APC)Â  cannot match the opposition in term of resources. The President also expressed sympathy for those defending him and his administration, describing such as a herculean task in the midst of opposition. President Buhari stated these while receiving members of the Buhari Media Organisation who paid him a courtesy visit at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He thanked the group for their sacrifices and sympathised with them for losing their friends in a bid to support him without any financial benefit. The Buhari Media Organisation was the media outfit of the APC campaign team in 2015 which was named Buhari Media Support Organisation.
