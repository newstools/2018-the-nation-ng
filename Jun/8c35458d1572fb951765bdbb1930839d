The Coalition of South-South Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines & Agriculture has urged the Federal Government to sign the Continental Free Trade Area (CFTA) agreement. It will increase the nation’s economic growth by  $2.9 billion with an estimated 8.18 per cent increase in Nigeria’s total export. Its President, Prince Billy Gillis Harry, who spoke in Lagos at the weekend, said signing the trade treaty will also expand market access for export of Nigeria’s goods and services, covering a market of 1.2 billion Africans with a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of $2.5 trillion. CFTA’s broad objectives, according to Harry, is to overcome dependence on exportation of primary products, promote social and economic transformation for inclusive growth, as well as industrialisation and sustainable development, accelerating the diversification of intra-African trade with the aim of increasing trade by 50 per cent by 2022. He said it will also create a free market for goods and services and pave the way for the establishment of the Continental Customs Union, enhance competitiveness at all levels and more specifically at the industrial level through exploiting opportunities for scale economies. He said: “The focus of the CFTA is trade in goods and services, intellectual property rights, competition policy and investment. The negotiation is to be conducted in two phases. Thus, phase one covers trade in goods and trade in services while phase two shall cover intellectual property rights, competition policy and investment. “Protocols on trade in goods and services have been concluded in the first phase and included in the framework agreement. The second phase of negotiation is scheduled to commence in June, 2018.”
