Like the late MKO Abiola, one of his daughters, Waliyah Abiola, discovered her music talent early in life, but unlike her father, she says the passion has come to stay, even if riches were to so flow her way later. Her stage name his simply Waliyah. A graduate of Imperial College London, this sultry singer says she started singing as a teenager, but never thought anything of it professionally, until about 10 years ago. To underscore how seriously she is taking her passion, Waliyah headlined a sold-out concert at London’s Jazz Cafe in 2011. She had organised and promoted the show herself. The following year, she wrote and performed the BBC approved Olympic UK single, ‘It’s Time’  which was hugely promoted by Coca Cola, Grammy award-winning Super producer, Patrick Leonard, Quincy Jones, and Nigeria’s Funmi Iyanda among others. An Afro-pop singer, Waliyah started gaining prominence in Nigeria after releasing her debut single, ‘Ejekajo’ which received critical reviews on notable channels like Studio 53 Extra, Channel 0, MTV, Nigezie, Soundcity and others. Apart from her debut song, she has other songs like ‘Siwaju’, produced by Sarz and ‘Shut It Down’, produced by Tee Y Mix. She has also shared the stage with established artistes like Tiwa Savage, Omawunmi,  Nneka and 2Baba at various shows. Despite having a Master’s degree in Engineering, she believes that her late father could have supported her music career, in view of his antecedents and love for the arts. “I have fond memories of him singing ‘The Beatles’ songs in the kitchen,” she says.
