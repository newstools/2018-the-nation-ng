Days after celebrating his 37th birthday, red carpet host, Denrele Edun is set to change the life of a lucky up and coming artiste in what he described as his ultimate birthday giveaway worth two million naira. According to Denrele, having been in the industry for a while and with understanding of what it takes to become a star, he will be shooting a video for an up and coming artiste. He stated, “And to the ultimate 37th birthday giveaway, I want to shoot a music video for an upcoming artiste (who will blow with my divine intervention….I’ll personally carry this person’s matter on my head) “As a major front runner in the music industry (I’ve been veejaying for more than a decade), I’ve worked with practically every Nigerian artiste and somehow somewhat, will remain part of their success story. And I totally understand the music video industry hustle which is why this giveaway is on a 2 million naira budget.” The giveaway, he further revealed, includes a free music video with an internationally acclaimed director, props and free promo both home and abroad. To be the lucky winner, followers of the presenter are tasked to tag a well deserving music artiste. “I’ll pick the best 37 reasons and narrow them down to 10. Will meet the 10 upcoming artistes with an industry jury, listen to their material and pick my winner,” he wrote. Denrele also promised to do a cameo appearance in the video too.
