In May, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) retained interest rates. While reading the decision of the committee, CBN Governor Godwin Emefiele, said the rates were held because inflation is still above the committee’s single-digit target. “Despite the drop in inflation, the current inflation rate is still above the targeted single digit. The objective of the policy stance, therefore, would be to accelerate the reduction of inflation to single digit to promote economic stability. “There is need to see how all the components of the gross domestic product would evolve in the second quarter of 2018 in order to gain greater clarity on the direction of monetary policy,” he said.
