FT: Brazil made their fans sweat, but they got the job done with a late show sparked by Coutinho’s 91st minute strike. Neymar added gloss with a further goal in added time. The PSG man was at the heart of the game throughout, including winning a penalty which was sensationally overturned by VAR. Brazil have their win. The only way is up from here.
