Osun State Governor Rauf Aregbesola has urged Nigerians to live together in harmony and promote peace and unity, irrespective of their faith. The governor spoke in Osogbo, the state capital, when executive members of the Association of Christian Journalists of Nigeria (ACJ) visited him. He said religion is personal and nobody should try to fight for God. Aregbesola admonished Christians and Muslims to pursue common good, rather than the killings being witnessed in some parts of the country in the name of God. The Chairman of ACJ’s Board of Trustees (BoT), Prince Adeola Adeboye, hailed the governor for the transformation of the state. He said the association was impressed by the governor’s performance in infrastructure, agriculture, education, youth empowerment and security.
