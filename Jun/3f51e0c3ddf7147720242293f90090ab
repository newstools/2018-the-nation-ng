Chief of Staff to the Imo State Governor Ugwumba Uche Nwosu has described reports that he has suspended his governorship ambition as unfounded and baseless. Nwosu reiterated that his ambition has been strengthened by the activities of the opposition, which, he said, has prepared him for the task ahead. The aspirant, who was reacting to a publication that he may have jettisoned his push for the governorship, stressed that cheap blackmail and propaganda would not stop his ambition. Nwosu maintained that he is undisturbed by the political intrigues and controversies during the congresses, saying his ambition is “divine and cannot be truncated by any man”. He said: “There is nothing that can be farther from the truth than such report that I have suspended my ambition. It is those in the opposition that have suspended their governorship aspirations because of the fear of Ugwumba Uche Nwosu. “They are afraid because they know they don’t stand a chance against the will of God and the people. We are very focused on the goal and we cannot be distracted. If you watch carefully, you will see that we are not resting, we are moving and taking our message to the nooks and crannies of the state, while the so called Coalition Group are running around in hotels in Abuja looking for ways to subvert the will of the people, they are not on ground and none of them can win any election in Imo.”
