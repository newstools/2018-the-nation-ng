Argentina defender Marcos Rojo has revealed that without Lionel Messi it will be difficult for the Albiceleste to win against Super Eagles in Russia. The Manchester United centre-back also revealed that the Albiceleste wants “payback” for Argentina’s World Cup final agony four years ago, but conceded the three-time African champion as blocking stone in the Group D fixtures for the Russia mundial. He however hopes that Messi – considered the best player in the world and regarded by many as the greatest of all time- will be in full form into the World Cup and at his best form against the Super Eagles on June 26 at Saint Petersburg Stadium. “It’s Nigeria again!, yea I think it’s three or four times now we’ve been drawn with Nigeria and it will be a difficult group. Croatia and Iceland are in there too. Hopefully, Lionel Messi will be in form and can do something for us against the Africans and the rest.” The 26-year-old continues, “Obviously, it’s a really important thing and a big deal for any Argentinian to wear the national team shirt,” he told Inside United.  “We really feel the shirt a lot and we defend our colours. “We give everything when we are wearing it and we want payback for the way things happened at the last World Cup. We will do everything to give our fans the possibility to celebrate winning the trophy again,” he added. Though Argentina have a final warm-up fixture against Israel on Saturday before the action gets under way in Russia, they however hope for fancy chances in Russia, despite struggling to actually clinch a spot, before Lionel Messi bagged a hat-trick against Ecuador in the final South American qualifier.
