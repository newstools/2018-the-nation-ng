South Africa’s national prosecutor has turned down a request by former president Jacob Zuma to delay a hearing over a 2.5 billion dollars arms deal, a spokesman for the prosecutor said on Tuesday. The case will resume on Friday. Zuma faces 16 charges including fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a 1990s deal to buy European military hardware to upgrade South Africa’s post-apartheid armed forces. Zuma, who has denied any wrongdoing, was in court in April in a procedural appearance. NAN
