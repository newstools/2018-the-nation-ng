Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc is using a new campaign to validate its depth and far-reaching scope in service delivery. The new brand campaign reinforces the brand focus that it enables ‘you to be’ and ‘be all you can be’. According to the bank, the campaign will run on radio, television, press, outdoor, advertising, and digital, among other channels of communication. It exposes the main business pillars on which the Stanbic IBTC brand stands – a full service financial institution with a clear focus on Corporate and Investment Banking, Personal and Business Banking and Wealth Management. Launched on June in Lagos, the brand campaign comes against the backdrop of the sixth anniversary of Stanbic IBTC’s adoption of a holding company structure in line with the Central Bank of Nigeria’s directive for separation of core commercial banking activities from other financial activities such as stockbrokerage, asset management and pension, among others. The campaign catalogues Stanbic IBTC’s customer segment from cradle to estate management. This means, babies, youths and adults, so there is something for everyone. It also restates its commitment to supporting people of all walks of life to accomplishing their goals. It is based on insights from market research on customer expectations which has become particularly imperative as the group continues to expand its offerings across the financial services landscape. Speaking in Lagos, Chief Executive of Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, Yinka Sanni, said “the pivotal message here is first and foremost that of appreciation, encouragement and guarantee for our esteemed customers that we are their partner at every stage through life’s journey, to make progress real by enabling people and businesses.” He noted that enormous improvements have been made across the businesses in terms of product and service offerings, access channels and customer care, as well as innovation and technological application.
