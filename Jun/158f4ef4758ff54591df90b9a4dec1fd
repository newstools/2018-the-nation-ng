Fresh stain on the credibility of African referees in Russia has emerged with six days to the commencement of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The fresh concern emerged as a $600 bribe scandal involving Kenya’s Adel Range Marwa was uncovered. A report surfaced on Thursday that the World Cup-bound referee and a member of the FIFA Council received a $600 cash gift against FIFA ethics. Marwa who has since been relieved from his assigned duty at the mundial by FIFA allegedly received the sum in cash from an undercover journalist; Anas Aremayaw Anas. Ghana’s Fifa Council member Kwesi Nyantakyi, the second most powerful man in African football, was also caught up in a separate sting operation in the report. Since aired on BBC the Anas Aremayaw Anas’ report which has raised wide dust on the caliber of referees from Africa for the World Cup. NationSport can report that FIFA has chosen six African officials for the Russia mundial and in addition there will also be 10 assistant referees from Africa. The referees and the assistants make up a total of 99 officials selected for the tournament and are selected from 46 countries with Nigeria excluded.
