Enugu State-born artiste, Okolo Miracle Obiechina, otherwise called Swazzi has featured Davido in his latest single titled ‘Je Ko Balance.’ Swazzi said the FIA singer surprised him with the feature “I never planned on featuring Davido on the song when I was making it,” he said. “I recorded the full song in 24hrs with my producer and played it to a friend to tell me what he thinks about it, he then collected the song and played it to Davido and he loved it and voiced on it the following day. When I heard David voiced on the song I was so excited cos I didn’t see that coming said Swazzi.” ‘Je Ko Balance’, featuring Davido is out on all music platforms and also on Swazzis YouTube channel “officialswazzi” and @officialswazzi on Instagram. Swazzi who has worked with stars like Olamide, Cabo Snoop, Reminisce and Dj Coublon said works are in progress for the visuals of ‘Je Ko Balance.’ “You know Davido has been on tour, so he hasn’t been around that much for the shoot, but we already talked about the shoot. So we are shooting soon.” On what stands him out in the industry, the Afro-highlife singer said, “I’m bringing loads of new vibes to the industry that will make me stand out, from the way I sing, to the way I dress and also the fact that I add Swahili, French and Portuguese to my song makes me stand out already.”
