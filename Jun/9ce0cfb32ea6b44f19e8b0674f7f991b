The Redeemed Christian Church of God(RCCG) has flagged of a political awareness campaign tagged ‘Let my people vote’, signaling what  many described as a revolutionary move by arguably the fastest growing church in the world. Some notable church leaders at the event, which was held weekend at RCCG Youth centre on Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, were Chairman of Lagos State Christian Association of Nigeria(CAN), Apostle Alex Bamgbola; Pastor J.T Kalejaiye, Special Assistant to the General Overseer on Evangelism, Pastor Idowu Iluyomade and Special Assistant to the General Overseer on Christian Social Responsibility, Pastor Bosun Emmanuel. It was the consensus at the meeting that Christians should play very active roles in the process leading to a new political dispensation in 2019. Assistant Pastor- in- Charge of RCCG Region 1, who is also the coordinator of this initiative, Pastor Ola Adejubee, attributed the vision to General Overseer of the church, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, during the annual ministers’ thanksgiving in January 2018. According to him, during his introductory message, Pastor Adeboye jolted the ministers when he instructed them to go and collect their PVCS. ‘If the statement came as a surprise to the ministers, they became dumbfounded when in August last year, during RCCG annual ministers’ conference, Adeboye asked them to go and join any political party of their choice. “This time, it was with an emotional laden voice,” he stated.
