A presidential hopeful and former deputy Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria, Professor Kingsley Moghalu is not losing sleep over Super Eagles’ chances at the Russia 2018 World Cup which is less than two weeks away. Moghalu’s optimism is hinged on the exposure accruing from tune-up matches against tough opposition, which according to the political economist, was not only a dress rehearsal but good for their nerves. He said: “I believe strongly in this team. The friendly games have emboldened our players. The world will, for a change, see something spectacular from our country beyond insecurity and corruption. These boys are carrying the undiluted love of 180 million Nigerians. In soccer, we are one tribe, one tongue”. While commending the NFF for settling all financial obligations in good time, Moghalu believes the duo of Alex Iwobi and Victor Moses are destined for great heights at the Mundial. “We have not seen the best of Iwobi yet. That boy carries Nigeria on his head on the field of play. His uncle, Jay Jay Okocha, did wonders with the ball. Iwobi will dance more than ‘cha cha cha’ in Russia. Moses will have planet Earth in his cleats with tantalising runs from the wings”, the former Central Bank Deputy Governor added. On Skipper Mikel Obi, Moghalu wants him to quit on a high. “Mikel has shown patriotism at its best. He bagged a silver medal at the 2005 World Youth Championships and picked bronze at the Rio 2016 Olympics. I wish God could turn silver and bronze to something more precious”.
