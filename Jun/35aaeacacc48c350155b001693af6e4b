The All Progressives Congress (APC) yesterday inaugurated its state chapters chairmen at its national secretariat Abuja. Speaking at the ceremony, the National Cahirman, Chief John  Odigie-Oyegun advised the chairmen to work towards the reelection of President Muhammadu Buhari. He also urged them to make frantic efforts at returning the party to its lost glory. He charged them to : “Go and tell the people of the great achievements recorded by the APC Government. Your Government is on the right course. A firm foundation has been laid for the development of Nigeria. Inspire of lean resources, APC has achieved much more in three years.” Oyegun asked the chairmen to keep aside their grievances and disaffections in order to succeed in reelecting the president and ensuring the party’s success in 2019 general elections. Continuing, the national chairman said “get  acquainted with the achievements put together in a document which I will make available to you. Tell Nigerians the achievements of your government. In infrastructure; a lot of roads have been constructed, agriculture; much rice is produced, transport, rail is there and power we now have 7000 megawatts. “There is serious need for quick reconciliation especially in Rivers, Taraba, Oyo, Delta, Lagos and others.  Let the chairmen here wait and should not inaugurate their EXCOS like the others until the issues with the Congresses in such states are resolved. ” I’m going to set up a committee headed by the Deputy National Chairman North to study the situations in such states for possible actions. There will be concessions and harmonizations after the exercise within this week.”
