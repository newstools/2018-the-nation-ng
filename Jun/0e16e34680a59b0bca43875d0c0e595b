Bread seller-turned model Olajumoke Orisaguna, whose grass to grace story set the media and society agog two years ago, has signed another endorsement deal. Last week, Olajumoke got signed as an ambassador for Ruutos Hair South Africa while in Johannesburg for Soweto Fashion Week. Ruutos Hair is rated as one of the leading hair business in South Africa. According to information, Ruutos is a network marketing company on a mission to empower, enrich and inspire women through the redefining of hair care. The Soweto fashion week (SFW) which kicked off last Wednesday ran till Saturday, June 2. Olajumoke who was formerly a bread seller, first appeared on the cover of This day style magazine. She also became brand ambassador to Stanbic, Payporte and some others. In March, Olajumoke was also a guest at the Arise Fashion Week where she appeared as a runway model with British rapper, Tinie Tempah, who was instrumental to her being discovered. In 2016, the sharp and searching lens of TY Belloâ€™s camera seems to have paved the way for the accidental model whose sudden rise to fame is a story for motivation for some. She was discovered by chance when she accidentally photo-bombed a live photo session of TY Bello, a renowned photographer. Bello was taking pictures of British rapper, Tinie Tempah, as he prepares to feature on the cover of ThisDay Style.
