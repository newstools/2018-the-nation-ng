Lagos State Government yesterday warned parents and employers not to discriminate against people living with albinism. The government also said it would intensify efforts to stop injustice against those with physical disabilities. Speaking at the International Albinism Day at the Adeyemi Bero Auditorium at the state secretariat, Alausa, Ikeja, Ministry of Youth and Social Development Permanent Secretary Hakeem Muri-Okunola said the campaign against inhuman treatment and stigmatisation of albinos would be stepped up to tackle challenges facing them. The sensitisation, he said, was necessary to stop the erroneous belief about albinos. “Our entire negative societal attitude towards person living with albinism must change. We must stop all acts or discrimination against albinos! Parents must take very good care of their children by giving painstaking devotion to God’s peculiarity of their skins and challenges with their sights,” he added. Muri-Okunola appealed to employers in the private sector to always give people with albinism job to allow them prove their worth. He said they were usually determined, trustworthy and highly efficient in service delivery. “Let’s ensure that people living with albinism are socially, politically and economically integrated,” he said. The guest speaker, Dr Olufunmilyo Ajose, said parents of children with Albinism should not see their children as subjects of misfortune but blessings from God. She said they could attain their full potential if their parents gave them the needed special attention and care. Albinos, she said, required special reading materials and other equipment to enable them attain their full potential, urging their parents to prevent them from direct impact of the sun.
