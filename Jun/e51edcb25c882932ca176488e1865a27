Banking on the successful run of his debut concert tagged ‘Oxymoron: X-Files’, celebrated Nigerian comedian, who was made popular by his brand of ‘music-comedy’, Otolorin Peter Kehinde, popularly known as Kennyblaq, is set for this year’s edition. The highly sought-after comedian has fixed Sunday, July 29 at Eko Hotel & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos for the show which he tags ‘Oxymoron II: The Rush’. Speaking on the show, Kenny, as he is fondly called, said; “We have been working on this event behind the scene for a few months now. The plan is to raise the bar higher and deliver total and original entertainment and art to Nigerians. We won’t disappoint come July 29 by the grace of Almighty God.” He further added that in its first year, ‘Oxymoron I’ established itself as a deviation from the norm, deploying elements of Broadway style stage productions. In tune with the comedian’s unique delivery, the event featured dance, comedy and music from acts like Adekunle Gold, 9ice, Woli Agba Ajewole, Josh2Funny, SLKomedy and others. Last year, Kennyblaq and his team’s hard work were deservedly adjudged as ‘Best Comedy Show of the Year’ at the Naija FM Comedy Awards beating other hot contenders to the crown. Kennyblaq has earned plaudits from key industry stakeholders including veteran comedian Ali Baba who tipped him as the future of the industry.
