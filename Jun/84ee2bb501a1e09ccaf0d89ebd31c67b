Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Thursday said it would boost the power supply in Ogun State with construction of four substations of 330KVA capacity each across the state. The sub – stations which are sited in Ogijo (Sagamu), Agbara, Mountain of Fire Ministry area by the Lagos – Ibadan expressway  and Arigbajo(Ifo) would be completed soon. The TCN’s Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Gur Mohammed, disclosed this at the Official inauguration of the new 60MVA, 132/33KV transformer by  Governor Ibikunle Amosun,  at the TCN Transmission substation, Ijebu – Ode, Ogun State. The Governor was represented at the occasion  by his Chief of Staff, Chief Tolu Odebiyi. Mohammed explained that the need to build the four substations was predicated on the increasing energy requirements of the state following its industrialising status and the socioeconomic life of the people. On the newly installed 60MVA 132/33 KV transformer, he said the project increased the existing 48MW – power substation in Ijebu – Ode to 96 MW and reduced the load shedding being experienced within Ijebuland and its environs. According to him the civil and installation works on the new facility were carried out by TCN staff of Osogbo transmission region when the Indian firm  contracted to do the job, failed to deliver the after the contract was awarded since 2012 under the  World Bank sponsored project at the cost of nine million US dollars (N166m)
