Following his contract with Peter Okoye (Mr P)’s P Classic Records, Fabian Okike, aka Singah has released his debut single titled ‘Teyamo.’ Delivered on a mid-tempo beat with a Spanish title, ‘Teyamo’ (Te Amo) which means ‘I love you’, the song, produced by Daihard beats with guitar strings played by Mr P was released alongside its video, directed by Unlimited LA with cameo appearance by Mr P. On what inspired the song, the R&B singer said, “I have always wanted my debut single to stand out from the normal trending vibes, so I decided to do a song that has a Latino vibe with a little bit of Spanish in it. “Then I came across this common Spanish words “te amo” which means I love you. “Teyamo is danceable and 100 percent love song with a lot of emotions fused into it. And I knew there was something missing then I decided to add some Spanish guitar to give it that complete Afro Latino vibe.” Singah who is also a song-writer got signed to P Classic last year, but has kept low profile until the release of his debut on Friday June 1. The video of ‘Teyamo’ had gathered over 17,000 views within 48 hours of its release on YouTube.
