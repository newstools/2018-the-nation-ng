Commercial activities at the cargo section of the  Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos was yesterday  grounded following the introduction of a new policy by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Lagos Airport Command. Clearing agents accused the command of tripling charges imposed on them for clearance of consignments at the airport. The clearing agents in their hundreds protested the directive of Mrs. Jayne Shoboiki, the Customs Area Comptroller (CAC), MMA Command that all consignments must as from July 13, 2018 be on Form M. The agents insisted that the policy was anti-progress, stressing that some of the consignments could not come with Form M as they were not major goods. Mr. Chris Nwabuzor, a member of the Association of Nigerian Licensed Customs Agents (ANLCA) at the Lagos Airport, in an interview said most of the policies introduced by the CAC could not work at the airport as some of their consignments could not fall into the category directed by the command. Immediately the protest began, Customs at the command locked the long room while the leaderships of the clearing agents ordered their members to vacate the premises.
