The management of Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, has reinstated two of the students that were suspended last year. The students were reinstated by the Vice Chancellor of the University, Eyitope Ogunbodede, during a meeting conveyed by the Dean of Students Affairs, Isiaka Aransi, amongst other official of the varsity. Omole Ibukun, a final year student of Civil Engineering and Oluwalade Babatunde, a 300 level student of English were suspended after their involvement in the power outage protest in October. The Vice Chancellor also ordered the reactivation of the online E-portal of other four students; Kazeem Olalekan, Oyedeji Samson, Gbenga Oloniniran, and Afolabi Samuel. “I have no interest in the victimisation of any student. I love a vibrant union but it should be done in a right manner. “The university is not interested in jailing the students. We will like to establish that the university is not in anyway interested in the victimisation of students and we never charged any of our students to court. It was done by the state. We want our students to be of good character for smooth running of activities,” he said. The Vice Chancellor however promised to lift the ban on union activities. When asked about the other former union executives who fought over fund last year, Tosin Jacob and Adedayo Emmanuel, the Vice Chancellor  said they have been placed on a two-semester suspension. “We cannot compromise the suspension of those who brought national disgrace to the school.” However, reacting to this development, one of the reinstated students, Omole Ibukun, said, “It is not yet a victory until we are rid off victimisation and repression on Nigerian campuses, especially in OAU.”
