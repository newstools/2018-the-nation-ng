An Upper Area Court 3 sitting in Kasuwan Nama in Jos on Wednesday sentenced a 35-year-old applicant, Raymond Adamu, to two years in prison for for raping a minor. The judge, Yahaya Mohammed, sentenced Adamu without any option of fine. Mohammed said it would serve as deterrent to others who would want to indulge in such act. The prosecutor, Sgt.Ibrahim Gukwat, had earlier told the court that the case was transferred from 3 Armoured Division, Rukuba, to Force CID Jos on March 20. Gukwat said Adamu, in company of two others now at large, conspired and drugged and raped the 17-year-old girl. When arraigned, Adamu pleaded guilty to the charge, which the prosecutor said contravened sections 97(2) and 283 of the penal code law.
