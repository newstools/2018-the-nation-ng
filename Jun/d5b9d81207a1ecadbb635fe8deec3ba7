POLICE authorities yesterday presented cheques totalling N29,836,378 to 51 families of police officers, who lost their lives while serving the country. Beneficiaries are from the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Niger and Kaduna states. Assistant Inspector-General (AIG) of police in charge of Zone 7 Taiwo Lakanu, who presented cheques to the beneficiaries in Abuja, said it was the duty of the force to take care of officers and their families. Lakanu said state commissioners of police under the zone would present the remaining cheques to other beneficiaries. Lakanu said: “On behalf of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), I will like to present these cheque leaves to you: it is symbolic. “Without these officers, most of us will not be where we are today because they carried out our instructions. They are most sincerely appreciated.” He added that the late officers paid the supreme price to curtail crimes and criminality in the country. Lakanu also said the IG restated his commitment to ensure that what accrued to the families of the deceased officers was given to them. He noted that apart from the group life insurance for officers, the IG took it upon himself  to create special welfare fund, known as IG Welfare Fund, to boost the package. The police chief noted that the essence of the gesture was not the money but the idea behind it, which is to let the families  know that they are not forgotten. He said: “This package is just one of the things the IG, in his wisdom, planned for widows and children of the late officers.” He condoled with the beneficiaries and assured them of continued support of the force. Responding on behalf of the beneficiaries, Mr. Andrew Moses appealed to the Force to continue to support the families. He hailed the IG for the fatherly care and urged him not to relent in efforts to support the families of late officers.
