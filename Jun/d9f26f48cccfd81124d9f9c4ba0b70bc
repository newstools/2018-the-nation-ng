The Association of Faculty of Arts Students Press organisation (AFAS Press), University of Ibadan organised a workshop on “Becoming mainstream journalists amidst the Escalating employment crisis, online media the way out?” last Saturday, where participants were told to be outstanding. The workshop was facilitated by award-winning investigative Journalist ‘Fisayo Soyombo, from whose wealth of experience many campus journalists have benefited. Soyombo, who was an active Campus Life writer, told the students that they might not achieve a fantastic Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) if they wanted to combine their studies with journalism. “If you want to be a journalist, your CGPA is the least important.  There are few exceptional persons in the job and what stands anyone out is ensuring you are above average,” he said. To excel as journalists, Soyombo advised: “Read widely; write extensively – write two times a week. Start tomorrow (June 24). Pick what you wrote and compare it with what you write one year later and compare. You will be amazed.” Soyombo also advised participants to seek to be published outside their academic environment.
