The controversial yet humorous issue of which country between Nigeria and Ghana cooks the more delicious jollof rice comes under the radar in this week’s edition of TV drama series, Professor Johnbull, sponsored by telecoms operator, Globacom. Entitled Ghana versus Nigeria Jollof, the episode highlights the ageless rivalry between two countries which are unarguably  the leading lights of the West African sub-region. The superiority battle between the two nations covers many areas of life, including sports and economy. Although the rivalry is in most cases healthy and often good for both countries’ development, there are times when it is not all that healthy, prompting the question as to whether indeed it is necessary in the first place. To highlight the lessons of the episode, two Ghanaian actresses, Martha Ankoma and Salma Mumin, engage in a supremacy battle with Nigeria’s Jumoke (Bidemi Kosoko) and Jeroboam (Osita Iheme) over which of the two countries has better culinary enterprise. Lending support to the Nigerian team are the Nkwobi joint owner, (Yomi Fash-Lanso), and Nje (Angela Okorie), but Flash (Stephen Odimgbe) chooses to support his new Ghanaian girlfriend, Ajuwa (Martha Ankoma). As viewers watch the interesting edition, several questions to be resolved include: Is there any basis for the Ghana-Nigeria superiority complex? What has tribe got to do with whether a man or a woman will make a better spouse or not? How does Professor Johnbull resolve the culinary contest between Ghana jollof rice and Nigeria jollof rice? Who wins at the end of the “contest”? Ghana versus Nigeria Jollof will run at 6.00 p.m. on Sunday on DSTV Africa Magic Family and GOTV Channel 2, with repeat broadcast on Thursday at 9.30 p.m. on the cable TV channels. Anambra Broadcasting Service will show the programme at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday and Saturday.
