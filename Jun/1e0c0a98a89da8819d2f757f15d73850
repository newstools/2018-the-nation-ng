Jung Woo-young says South Korea are braced to tackle a Mexico side set to play a more attacking style after El Tri stunned holders Germany at the World Cup. In Rostov-on-Don today, they will meet a Mexico team enjoying an unexpectedly commanding position following their stunning success against Joachim Low’s defending champions. But, according to Jung, El Tri are unlikely to employ the same counter-attacking approach at Rostov Arena, where Juan Carlos Osorio’s side will justifiably be considered the favourites. “Mexico have quick players who are good in one-on-one situations and like to penetrate [the opposition’s defence],” the midfielder said. “Compared to the match against Germany, I believe Mexico will play differently against us. Of course, we’re also not going to [play] like Germany. “You can compare the two teams on paper, but we know we have to produce results that can [disprove] people’s predictions. We’re not thinking about whether we are less talented or not a better team [than] Mexico. “We just think about how we can stop Mexico from playing their style of game.” Mexico coach Osorio confirmed Jung’s assessment, calling on his players to demonstrate their quality on the big stage as they seek to secure passage to the round of 16.
