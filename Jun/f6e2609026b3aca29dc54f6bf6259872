Ten governorship aspirants from the three major political parties in Nasarawa State have met to agree on a consensus candidate irrespective of political affiliations. They include aspirants of the All Progressive Congress (APC); Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), from Eggon. At a meeting of Eggon Council of Elders convened by the Paramount Ruler, Dr. Bala Angbazo, the aspirants vowed to abide by the pledge. Attendees at the meeting include Labaran Maku  (APGA); Solomon Ewuga (PDP); Godiya Akwashiki  (APC); Patricia Akwashiki (PDP); James Angbazu  (APC), Adamu Adogi (APC); Inusa Mohammed (APC); Danladi Envuluanza (APC); Dauda Kigbu (APC) and Mathew Ombugaku (Rebuild Party). Chairman of the Eggon Council of Elders Jato Anga, who spoke after the meeting, said they are on a collective mission to ensure that an Eggon man becomes the next governor. He lamented that Eggon people constitute over 60 per cent of the total population yet have not governed the state since it was created in 1996. “If you want to defeat an enemy, you sit and plan; and that is exactly what we have done. This time around, we have all agreed to come together irrespective of party affiliations, to ensure that an Eggon man becomes the next governor, and they have all agreed to work together.”
