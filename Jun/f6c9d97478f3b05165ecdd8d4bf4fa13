Spain, as expected, dominated their Iranian opponents through possession, but they struggled to create any chance of merit. Brendan Rodgers once called this type of tactic, “death by football,” but this was closer to Arsene Wenger’s pithy dismissal of, “sterile domination.” Luiz Suarez’s strike ensured that Uruguay managed a close 1-0 win over Saudi Arabia in Rostov on Don. In what was his 100th international game for Uruguay, Luis Suarez scored the winner (23’). “It was important for us to win and progress onto the next round. We wanted nothing else other than that,” said Suarez after the final whistle. “We’re definitely happy with the result. I obviously hoped it would go like this as we were preparing over the last few days. It was an important game for us.” Spain’s best chance of the half came with an overhead kick for David Silva after Iran had properly failed to clear a corner. The unusual creation of the chance, far from tiki-taka, betrayed how little inspiration Spain could summon. As Iran defended adroitly and with discipline, Spain started to grow frustrated. Diego Costa was cut off from his assorted playmakers, and risked a pointless booking when he appeared to deliberately tread on the toe of Iranian goalkeeper Alireza Beiranvand. Only the referee’s reluctance to use VAR saved him from censure. Spain’s senior players, including Sergio Ramos, remonstrated with the officials at half time to protest the time-wasting they perceived to be coming from Iran, but they soon showed they were better off focusing on their own performance. In the second half, Spain ramped up the pressure from the off, bringing a smart save from Beiranvand from a long-range Sergio Busquets shot, before Spain broke through when Ramin Rezaeian rattled a tackle against Costa’s shins, which cruelly deflected the ball past a wrong-footed goalkeeper.
