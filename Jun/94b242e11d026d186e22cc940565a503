Master Ikem Favour of Estate Primary School, Ile-Iwe Metta has emerged the winners of the primary school category of Spelling Bee Competition in Isolo Local Council Development Area (LCDA). Esiekpei Onome of Central Senior High School Okota beat others to the first prize in the secondary category. Onyeagam Chidiebere of Akinbaiye Primary School and Ayebayo Precious came second and third respectively. Evelyn Enwereuzo of Ajumoni Senior Grammar School and Oyelami Khalid of Okota Secondary School were runners-up. The council Chairman, Shamsudeen Abiodun Olaleye hailed Senator Oluremi Tinubu, for initiating the competition. The competition, he said, aside helping students to improve on their vocabulary, also helps them to study hard in their educational pursuit. According to him, his administration is on the threshold of returning public schools to its glorious past through interventions that would encourage pupils have equal opportunities with those in private schools. To ensure this, Olaleye said the council has taken delivery of a 100-seater school bus that would convey students to and from the school. “In the next two weeks, we’re going to take delivery of another one and hopefully we would buy the third one before the commencement of next academic session. In all, we have earmarked three buses to ease the movement of our pupils. The buses would pick pupils from Ilasamaja, Ajao Estate and Okota in the mornings and return them in the afternoon. This would allow the students to concentrate fully on their studies,” he said. Olaleye enjoined the pupils to shun drugs and cultism, stressing that such despicable acts do not only destroy dreams but also their lives.
