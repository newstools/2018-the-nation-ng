President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday evening broke the Ramadan fast with state governors under the umbrella of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in his official residence at Aso Rock, Abuja. The “Iftar” with the governors, unlike the previous ones, held with leadership of the National Assembly, judiciary and others, was not open to full media coverage. However, the official photographer to the President and cameraman from Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) were allowed to the venue of the event. Traditional rulers across the country will also be hosted by the President this week. NAN
