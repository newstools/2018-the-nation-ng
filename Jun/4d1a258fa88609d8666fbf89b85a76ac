Following intensive training and retraining embarked upon by the Nigeria Human Rights Commission, the Nigeria Police Force, has recorded a decline on Human right abuses. Speaking in Kano during a training workshop for Divisional Police Officers on the Human Rights, organized by the Human Right Commission in collaboration, with the Prison Reform Welfare Rehabilitation, (PRAWA), the Executive Director of PRAWA, Dr Uju Agomoh, expressed satisfaction on the level, with which the Police are adopting human-friendly method in their relationship with detained suspects. Dr Uju noted that the strategic Data they developed to ensure compliance of right protections among Officers, trained by the Human right Commission and the PRAWA showed a substantial reduction in torture, unnecessary refusal of access to Justice and Health facilities. Also, she noted that after developing the Data Base to monitor and capture specifically Police officers, trained on human right protections, they learnt that majority of them are complying, with the methodology of right protections, but still suggested more time to allow the full entrenchment of total human right protections compliance. On the occasion, the Deputy Inspector General of Police in charge of Training and Development, Emmanuel Inyang, explained during the workshop that officers would be offered the opportunity to equip themselves, with the necessary skills, knowledge and attitude to effectively discharge their duties in accordance with rule of law and in compliance with International best practices. He reminded Officers of their duties which includes serving communities, safeguarding lives and properties, protecting the innocent, keeping the peace and ensuring that rights of all to liberty, equality and justice is respected. To achieved the targeted purpose, DIG Inyang said the human rights training manual was designed, as a major resource for the teaching of human rights principles in training police. â€œLet me assure that the National Roll out of this Human rights training programme is to ensure that the message of protection and promotion of Human rights gets to every officer of the police, regardless of ranks.
