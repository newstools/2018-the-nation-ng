The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has urged Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to reduce the N17,000 damages imposed on students of Kano State University Of Science And Technology (KUST), Wudil. The students were mandated to pay the money to cover damages incurred when they protested the demise of their colleague who drowned in River Wudil on May 2. NANS’ national spokesman, Bestman Okereafor, in a statement yesterday Sunday, said many students were still struggling to pay their school fees. He said: “NANS is appealing to Governor Ganduje to mandate the school management to review the damages fee for the benefit of innocent students and vulnerable ones still struggling to pay the last session’s registration fee. “Our findings showed that over 1,000 students still could not afford to pay the registration fees in an institution of about 15,000 students. “NANS considers the N17,000 damages fee resolution of the Management of Kano State University of Science and Technology as too expensive.”
