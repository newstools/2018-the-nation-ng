oncerned about the high rate of young girls reaching puberty with little or no knowledge of it, Miss Port Harcourt City Queen, Oroma Shedrack, has started a project called ‘Pad it Up’ which is targeted at educating young girls about that stage of their life. The campaign which she has already taken to two schools in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, is expected to reach 20 schools before the end of the year. Queen Oroma who emegerd Miss Port Harcourt City last year said her passion for the girl-child made her to embark on the ‘Pad It Up’ project. “The young girls of today are the women of tomorrow,” she said. “Every year, an estimate of 50 million girls in Nigeria enter puberty and most of them have little or no knowledge of what they are going to do, this is a critical stage of life where young girls become young women and acquire fundamentals for hygiene management, develop self-esteem and build up confidence. ‘Pad It Up’ is a movement that will give them the necessary information and materials to help them navigate through puberty especially with regards to their menstrual cycle, a world that accepts menstrual hygiene as an integral part of health is a world that empowers its women, we believe that no girl should have to lose confidence during puberty.” She added that the project is targeted at young girls of 11 to 15 years that are new to menstruation/puberty Queen Oroma further disclosed that she has been able to get some sponsors for the project. “My director, Miss Anita May Igoni and I have gotten few sponsors that are interested in the project and some NGOs that are partnering with us like Always Ultra Care pad and Girl Power Africa,” she said.
