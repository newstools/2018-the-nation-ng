According to the Police Prosecutor, Ezekiel Ayorinde, an assistant Superintendent (ASP), the accused committed the offence on May 12 at his parent’s residence.

Neighbours noticed blood coming out of the girl’s private parts and when she was questioned, she told them what the accused did to her. “The case was reported to the police and the teenager was arrested,” Ayorinde said. The offences contravened Sections 135 and 137 of the Criminal Law of Lagos state, 2015 (Revised). The case was adjourned till July 9.
