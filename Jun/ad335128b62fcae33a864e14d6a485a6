An aspirant for the position of the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has said that he is not a dictator as being expressed in some quarters. Comrade Oshiomhole, who is the immediate past governor of Edo State, said that he got the support of APC governors and other party leaders across the country because they understand the type of person he is. Oshiomhole, who reiterated his loyalty to the party, said he would exercise his persuasive power and negotiating skill to resolve the crisis in the party. The former governor, who spoke in an interview with newsmen, said the majority of the party leaders supporting his aspiration believed he would improve the fortunes of the APC. Comrade Oshiomhole said he had never exercised dictatorial powers but persuasive powers and negotiating skills. He said: “If I have prominent people from the North, prominent people from the South, East and West, it means I will be the centre. No one will say if not for my support, you would not have been there. If you are a product of one section, then you might remain detained by that section if you feel that to return to that office, you must service that section because it is your support base. But when you have the privilege of broad support from many leaders, then no one leader will say I put you there, you must listen to me. “But let me also say that what is qualitatively different about this support is that there is no question about what is influencing this support. The support is being offered by people who cannot be procured, and this tells you it is flowing from the knowledge of my person. “I have been fortunate to work with all the governors, including past ones. Those I did not meet in office, I met them when I was the president of the NLC. They know what I stand for. They offered this support based on their understanding of my person and not inducement and that makes a difference.”
