 It was indeed complete drama Friday as Morocco last minute put victory on the plate for Iran at the Saint Petersburg Stadium.  The Atlas Lions of Morocco had kicked off the tie with all the fireworks they could muster and were very much in a hurry to clinch victory. The Herve Renard tutored side created more of the chances but were unable to convert any. Both teams had put in considerable effort in the first half living an impression that the second half will be full of fireworks. The second half of course lived up to prediction as both teams battled to the finish in search of breakthrough. It was however Iran that had the last laugh not because they scored the goal but because they mounted enough pressure forcing Morocco to hand over victory. It was Bouhaddouz’s own goal gave it to Iran. Iran will next take on Spain while Morocco face Portugal in two ties that cannot be considered tea parties at all. Friday’s win is very historical and will definitely ginger Iran. It is there second win in the world cup finals the first being against USA at the 1998 world cup in France.   So two African countries Egypt and Morocco filed out against opponents in search of vital points but ended up with none. How will it turn out for Nigeria and Super Eagles tomorrow?
