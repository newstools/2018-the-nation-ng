Remembered for his famous kicking of Vasilis Torosidis of Greece at the 2010 World Cup, making him the first Nigerian to be sent off at the World Cup, Sani Keita talks about his priceless World Cup memories. WHAT are your World Cup memories? Well, that’s a lot to remember about being at World Cup itself; it is priceless. How did you receive the news of your being picked for 2010? Honestly, it was a special moment. Share your experience both negative and positive. That’s always negative and positive things in our life, but I always prefer to be grateful for the positive ones and remember them. Tell us the positives and how it helped your career afterwards It doesn’t help career only but myself as a person too. As I said earlier, being at World Cup would always be priceless for any football player, not only myself. What lessons did you take from the World Cup and how can the current team benefit from it? Positive and negative. But, of course, the current team can benefit from the positive one which is giving 100% on the field. With our prayer, they can make us all proud. What are the chances of the team in Group D against Argentina, Croatia and Iceland? Honestly, we have the talent to go past group stage, but if we want to go past the group stage we need to rearrange our defence; that’s where we’re having issues, I think. Who will be Nigeria star man in Russia? Well, there are many talented players over there; I can’t choose one.
