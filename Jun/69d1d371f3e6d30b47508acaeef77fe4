“I have been married for six years, six wasted years with no child and no money in my bank account and yet married to a rich man, very rich man who owns hotels and houses all over. I don’t even have 20k to my name, he made sure of that and constantly bring down my pride. I endured and got tired and almost took my life before God ministered to me. I went into his room and saw up to 9 million naira in dollars and I carried just as the spirit led. I buried it in a safe place and waited for him to find out, so I Can face the implication to either die or stay alive to enjoy the money. He came back and asked and I told him I took it, he asked I return it back but I refused, he beat me up but I still did not , he arrested me but later bailed me after I refused . So he gave me condition. To either quit the marriage or produce the cash and remain in his house. But he gave me one week to make up my mind. I am confused, should I sacrifice the marriage for 12 million or just give it back to him and continue managing like I have been? This marriage has yielded nothing for me, but I don’t want to regret my action. I still saw some money today that he hid in the visitor’s restroom, should I take also and quit the marriage. What decision do you think is best?”  You can also share your story with us @info@thenationonlineng.net
