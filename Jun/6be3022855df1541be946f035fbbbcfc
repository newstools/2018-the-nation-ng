An accountant-turn gospel minstrel, Toyin Grace, also known as Teegrace has released her debut album titled Redeemer. The event took place at The Redeemers Christian Church of God, Lekki, Lagos. The soul-lifting dynamic nine-tracker has been produced by one of Nigeria’s finest music producers, Wole Oni. The album features blessing Irorere, Reigny Franklin, Nene Ukpo, Joy Obiekwu, Clifford Hnery, Melody Gabriel, Philladephia kes and Annie Jonathan. Speaking at the launch, Teegrace said: “I ventures into gospel music because God has called me to minister to my world, the message of repentance and reconciling men to God.” The artiste who said that her entry into the music industry is with a difference, added, “I am not an artiste but a minstrel. I am sent to save souls, restore backsliders, heal and deliver the oppressed from the shackles of the enemy.” She stressed that gospel music has the intrinsic power to change the world. “No matter the challenges faced by man, gospel music sang by men who are redeemed can do wonders that will shake the world. “I took a number of risks with this album and during the process l learnt to appreciate other different genre of music that I would have never thought I would enjoy or see myself doing,” she said. Teegrace opined that it is often easy to get discouraged, but, when we focus on God’s direction and plans for our life, we can overcome the urge to flee His plan. She added that to get the attention of our youth, our music must be danceable and enriching with soul-lifting lyric.
