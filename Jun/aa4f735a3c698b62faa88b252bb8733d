The National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA) has expressed its commitment to the protection of the environment. The organisation, in a statement yesterday by its President, Mrs Alaba Lawson, to mark world environment day,  said: “The annual world Environment Day is a period to remind ourselves that the care of our environment is indeed our joint responsibility because the environment is the base of life and economic activities. “In our country today, the various environmental problems are there for us to see: Air pollution is reflected in our major  cities across the country, land degradation, municipal solid wastes across the country,  climate change,  which is affecting all areas of our lives including  agricultural productivity. etc. All of these require our attention and call for concerted action. “We at NACCIMA want to use this opportunity to restate our commitment to the protection of our environment and pursuit of a  sustainable production pattern, for sustainable development of our economy. “We call for closer ties between government, the chambers movement and Organised Private Sector. “Steps must be taken by states to strengthen their capacity  to implement our National Policy on Environment, especially as it relates to the specific challenges of environment they face because the grassroots level is where the impact of the environment problems are felt most. “ This year’s World Environmental Day has the theme:  ‘Beating Plastic Pollution.’
