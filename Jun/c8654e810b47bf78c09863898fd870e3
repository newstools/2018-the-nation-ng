Activities have started picking up at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) in Idi-Araba. This followed the end of the strike by the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU). The union embarked on an indefinite strike on April 17, and the action entered seventh week when the union ended it. Patients have started receiving optimal medical and surgical attentions at various outpatient clinics, accident and emergency unit, as well as the paediatric sections. Our reporter, who visited the hospital yesterday, discovered that all the clinics were filled with patients. Doctors and other categories of workers were busy attending to patients – on appointment cards, registration desk, pay points and the consulting rooms. The outpatient clinics our reporter visited are: Diabetics, Cardiology, Neuro-surgery, Haematology, Paediatrics Cardiology, Paediatrics Neonatology, Immunoprophylaxis, Cleft palate, Gynaecology, Ear-Nose-Throat (ENT) and Orthopaedic. The pharmacy, paying points as well as private and hospital’s diagnoses centres were also functional. Doctors were also attending to patients at the annexe of the teaching hospital at Harvey Road in Yaba, where the Dermatology unit is located. The Nation observed an unusual attendance at the clinics, just as the medical team attended to the patients with promptness. While some patients occupied the sitting furniture, others were seen leaning on the walls. A patient, Mrs Felicia Amoo, complained about the effects the JOHESU strike had on patients before it was called off. According to her, she resides in Winners Chapel area of Ota in Ogun State with her five-year-old child who is undergoing diagnoses for the cause of fast-breathing. She said: “We have gone to the Cardiology (unit) and the cause had not been established. So, we were sent to Neurology, where we were told that it was the day we came for the appointment that the strike started.
