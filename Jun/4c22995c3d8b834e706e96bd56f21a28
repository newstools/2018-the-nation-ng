The Minister of Health, Prof Isaac Adewole, the Emir of Kano, Muhammed Sanusi II, and Kano State Governor Abdullahi Ganduje have inaugurated a TB mobile detection facility in Muhammadu Buhari Specialist Hospital Kano. They also launched Access to Care for Enrollees of Kano State Contributory Health Scheme (KSCHS), Free Breast Cancer Screening Programme for 1,000 women as well as distribution of laptops and internet moderms to Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Officers. Speaking on the projects, the minister said: “People like you make my work easy, while some call on me to help them but the message from your Excellency  is come and see what we are doing” He added that the “Wellness on Wheels (WoW) programme on TB was aimed at providing diagnostic facility and treatment to tuberculosis patients at their door step,” adding that, “Nigeria was one of the countries with large number of undetected TB patients in the world, Nigeria detected only 25 percent the remaining 75 percent Patients were not known and they also do not know that they were TB Patients.” Ganduje said the rationale behind establishing Muhammadu Buhari Specialist Hospital was to provide services not only to Kano State populace, but to the entire country. He said: “Our intension is not only to serve the people of Kano state but to make Kano center of medical tourism in order to reduce foreign medical tourism.” Emir Sanusi called on Nigerians, especially the wealthy, to support government at all levels with health facilities and equipment as the government alone could not cater for the need of all Nigerians in the health sector.
