Russia made a fine start to their 2018 FIFA World Cup campaign as they thrashed Saudi Arabia in the tournament’s opening game. Yuri Gazinskiy scored the first goal of the tournament after only 12 minutes when he headed in from Aleksandr Golovin’s cross. Substitute Denis Cheryshev added a second just before half-time as he collected Roman Zobnin’s pass, cut inside two Saudi Arabia defenders and finished well. Saudi Arabia, who returned to the World Cup for the first time since 2006, played some nice, tight football at times, but were never able to match the Russian hosts for energy or intent. Another substitute, Artem Dzyuba, grabbed Russia’s third within two minutes of coming on by heading in from Golovin’s delivery. Cheryshev scored a spectacular fourth with the outside of his boot, before Golovin curled in a stunning 25-yard free-kick for Russia’s fifth. Egypt and Uruguay are due to play the second Group A match in Yekaterinburg on Friday. Earlier, the opening ceremony had been led by British pop star Robbie Williams and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina in a 15-minute period wowed the Opening Ceremony/Match crowd. Part of the ceremony was the entrance of former Spain goalkeeper Iker Casillas and Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova with the World Cup trophy in a Louis Vuitton travel case. Williams later performed two hits — “Let Me Entertain You” and “Rock DJ” — alongside some dancers and freestylers. He was thereafter joined in a duet by Garifullina, a soloist from the Vienna State Opera, to sing one of his (Williams) hit songs “Angels”. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the 2018 World Cup continues on Friday with three matches, one of them the other Group A match pitching Egypt against Uruguay in Yekaterinburg.
