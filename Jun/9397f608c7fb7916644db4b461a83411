Five ex-policemen who are in trial for the alleged 2015 torture and murder of a car dealer. Mr. Benson Obode, have opened their defence at the Edo State High Court, Criminal Division. The five former policemen are Adedeji Adeleke, Joseph Omotosho, Oniyo Musa, Abena John and Henry Shobowale. They were members of the Special Anti Robbery Squad in Lagos State and were also accused of collecting the sum of N330,000 from late Benson’s bank account from an ATM in Port Harcourt. At the resumed hearing of the case on Friday, Musa Oniyo who was the first to be called told the court that Benson died of beating he received from a mob. Musa told the court that it was one Evans Idemudia that led his team to the house of Benson at about 2am but they didn’t meet him at home. He said they informed his landlord about their mission and were called later that Benson has been held by local vigilant in the area. The former policeman stated that they found that a mob has beaten Benson by the time they arrived to arrest him. During cross examination by the state prosecution team led by Charity Ebosele, Musa said it was the police practice not to bring out suspect from the cell to identify another suspect. He said Benson died at the police clinic in Bénin City after doctors battled to save his life. Justice Ohimai Ovbiagele adjourned the case to July 4th for further hearing.
