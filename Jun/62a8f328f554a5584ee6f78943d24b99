Governor of Ebonyi State and Chairman of Southeast Governors Forum David Umahi, has condemned the alleged renaming of Abakaliki street in Awka, the Anambra State capital by the state government. The governor made his feelings known in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary Emmanuel Uzor after the renaming of the street to ‘Club Street’ caused uproar on the social media. The governor while calling on the people to remain calm said he has contacted his Anambra counterpart, Willie Obiano with the aim of getting him to correct the action. Ebonyi and Anambra are in the Southeast region of the country together with Imo, Abịa and Enugu states which are predominantly Igbo speaking states. Umahi who noted that Mr. Obiano has every constitutional right to rename any structure,  be it road or any other infrastructure,  however pointed out that “in doing so,  what should come to mind should be the unity and perpetuation of legacies and sustenance of the sacred thing that holds us together as a people”. “While he condemns in its  entirety, Umahi has put everything in place to ensure that Chief Willie Obiano reverses the action of bringing back the Abakaliki street,  a name gazetted long time ago in the spirit of oneness in Igbo land”, said Mr Uzor. “There should be no part of Igbo land that should be discriminated upon. Ebonyi State has received the highest discrimination even from among her brother states and this is not healthy especially as we fight to unite our people and form formidable economic and political blocs”. “The Governor has put a call through to his brother Governor, Chief Willie Obiano on how best to resolve the conflict of interest especially as regards the social media claims that the street was taken away from Abakaliki people because they are not qualified to answer such name of a major street in Awka”
