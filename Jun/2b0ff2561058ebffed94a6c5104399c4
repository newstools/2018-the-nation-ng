The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, on Monday explained why the Federal Government suspended the Growth Enhancement Support Scheme (GES) initiated by former President Goodluck Jonathan’s administration. Ogbeh said the ministry was confronted with N67 billion debt claims from input suppliers involved in the GES scheme when the current administration took over in 2015. The minister stated this at the Seed Connect Conference and Exhibition organised by the National Agricultural Seeds Council (NASC) in Abuja. He said the ministry has commenced plans to replace the scheme with a new initiative -Agricultural Input and Mechanization Services (AIMS). He said: “When we assumed office we were confronted with the debt to the tune of N67 billion. We could not pay this because if we had paid we would not have been able to pay staff salaries. But AIMS would correct all the anomalies of GES and remove fraud practices. The minister said the GES program was cancelled due to paucity of funds.
