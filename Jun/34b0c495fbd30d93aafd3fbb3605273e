An aspirant of upper chamber of the legislative building from Osun West Senatorial District, Omoba Dotun Babayemi, has urged Muslims to observe the last 10 days of the ongoing fasting in strict adherence to the stipulation of the holy Quran. After his visit to 110 wards in 10 local government councils of the district, Babayemi said being a Christian does not rob him the understanding of what the month of Ramadan symbolises to the Muslims, pointing out that fasting is one of the bonds that exist between Muslims and Christians. Babayemi later distributed consumable items to his hosts with words of assurance that they would regularly be empowered by his foundation to live more meaningful life. If elected, Babayemi pledged to give the electorate adequate representation, adding that the era of a senator burning the bridge after election is over. Oluwo of Iwo Oba AbdulRasheed Akanbi told Babayemi of the need to encourage the youth to take active position of responsibilities. Babayemi promised the monarch to sponsor pro-youths bills when elected into the Senate. “My political philosophy is built round empowering the youth because in it lies the hope of this country. This is my focus, and I am not going to relent in this laudable project,” he said.
