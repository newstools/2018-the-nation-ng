Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, along with his wife, Mrs. Bolanle Ambode, will celebrate Eid-il-Fitri with Muslims simultaneously in Lagos. The celebration will hold at designated locations in each of the 20 Local Government Areas across the State. At these venues, apart from the usual merriment associated with such festivals, celebrating Muslims will have the opportunity to pray for sustainability of peace and continuation of development for Lagos. Prayers will be offered for the first family. A statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs said the administration of Governor Ambode believes that prayer has been playing pivotal roles in the rapid development and tranquillity in the state.
