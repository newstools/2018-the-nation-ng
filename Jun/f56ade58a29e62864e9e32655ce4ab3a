Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday met behind closed doors with the Inspector- General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, the Director- General of the Department of State Services (DSS), Lawal Daura and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Malami Abubakar. At the end of the meeting, the IGP declined comment on the outcome of the parley. He directed journalists who approached him to meet Osinbajo’s staff on the outcome of the meeting. Before the meeting, Osinbajo, Abubakar Malami, and Daura were seen around President Muhammadu Buhari’s office separately. The issues discussed at the meeting may not be unconnected with the police invitation of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, over the Offa bank robbery. At a press conference in Abuja on Sunday, the Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Moshood Jimoh, said Saraki was linked to the Offa robbery for allegedly supplying arms and vehicles to political thugs who were arrested for their involvement in the bank robbery. Saraki had declared the accusation as baseless and another ploy by the police to implicate him by all means. However, in a dramatic twist, the police on Monday evening asked the Senate president to respond to the allegations within 48 hours.
