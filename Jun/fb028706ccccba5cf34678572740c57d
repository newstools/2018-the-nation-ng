In the poll conducted by Sky Sports, the Nigeria jersey garnered over 40,000 votes to beat world champions Germany to second place with 21,000 votes.

Nike’s Football Design Director, Dan Farron has said in designing Nigeria’s kit, the goal was to tap into the attitude of the nation while keeping in mind the full identities of the Super Eagles players.
