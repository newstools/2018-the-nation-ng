The newly-elected Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC), Iru/Victoria Island chapter, Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Fasanya, has urged members to be united, stressing that “this is necessary for the party’s advancement.” Speaking at the weekend at the inauguration of members of the executive council, as well as ward chairmen and other newly-elected officers, Fasanya, a former secretary, Iru/Victoria Island Local Council Development Area, said although APC was well grounded in the area, members still needed to be more united and work hard to ensure victory during elections. One of the new officers, Mr. Niyi Osoba, restated his colleagues’ preparedness to work for the party’s progress. He reiterated members’ confidence in the leadership of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and a chieftain of APC in the area, Chief Rilwan Alesinloye, among other leaders. Osoba advised members to get their permanent voter cards (PVCs), saying no stone must be left unturned in ensuring victory for the party in next year’s general election.
