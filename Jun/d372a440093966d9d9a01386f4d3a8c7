The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) has renewed commitment to tax cooperation in Africa. The two multilateral bodies signed the renewal of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) till June 2023, agreeing to continue to work together to improve tax systems in Africa, during a meeting in Pretoria, South Africa recently. The MoU sets their co-operation towards the achievement of the common objective of promoting fair and efficient tax systems and administrations in Africa. Justifying the need for the Mou, Logan Wort, Executive Secretary of ATAF, stated that, “ATAF has made tremendous strides in its ability to offer concrete and tangible benefits to member administrations. Our targeted technical assistance work in stemming Illicit Financial Flows (IFFs) that erode Africa’s tax base in key sectors, has begun to bear fruit and is a key driver in advancing Africa’s development Agenda 2063. Our two organisations enjoy a special relationship that has contributed to the sharing of knowledge and the development of better tax policy for Africa and technical skills of African revenue administrators.” Echoing similar sentiments, Pascal Saint-Amans, Director of the OECD’s Centre for Tax Policy and Administration, said: “It has been a privilege to partner with ATAF in the past nine years,” adding, “Our work with African countries is an essential component which helps us to develop new international tax standards.” The group holds the view and very strongly too that domestic resource mobilisation (DRM) is essential to reach the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) also recognised the universal nature of the tax challenges of the 21st century.
