Members of the executive of University of Nigeria Alumni Association (UNAA), Lagos branch, have begun what they called “appreciation visit” to members of the association, who contributed to the successful hosting of the National Executive Council (NEC) meeting recently. Prominent among those visited was Prof Pat Utomi, who hosted the alumni members to a forum where discussions around upcoming activities and yet-to-be-implemented projects were held. The projects are sited in Lagos and on the university campus. President of the alumni body, Sir Orji Udemueze,  appreciated members, who supported the association in cash and kind, while calling on graduates of the university to identify with the association and contribute their quota to the development of their alma mater. Udemueze announced next Sunday as the date for general meeting, urging the school graduates living in Lagos to turn-up at the UNN Lagos Liaison Office in Ikeja. As part of the activities of the meeting, Udemueze announced that the alumni body would be fully involved in the Students’ Week organised by the Students’ Union Government (SUG), which is scheduled to hold in the third quarter of the year.
