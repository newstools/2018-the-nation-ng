T’S ALL OVER! Germany are out of the World Cup. What. A. Finish. Incredible. Germany did not look at the races from kick off and despite an improved second half performance, they could not get past a well drilled South Korea defence, with VAR handing South Korea the opening goal in the 91st minute before Son netted a second five minutes later, deep into injury time.  The Germans – players and fans – are in tears and they have never exited at the World Cup group stages as we know them now. They have never really looked like defending their title and they will head home now.
