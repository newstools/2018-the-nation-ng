 *says team needs Salah desperately Former Super Eagles Sunday Oliseh has given Pharaohs of Egypt a pat on the back despite their lone goal defeat by Uruguay Friday. Egypt according to Oliseh did Africa proud by their performance. He maintained that the team displayed tactical discipline and showcased a lot of hard work.  He submitted however that the team needs the services of their super star Mohammed Salah who was left on the bench in the encounter.  Salah was seen after the match especially after the goal, looking very disappointed. “Proud of Egypt’s performance today vs Uruguay. Did Africa proud Though they lost,they did well tactically & worked hard.They have a chance to qualify but they need Mo Salah desperately,” Oliseh submitted shortly after the match. The Pharoahs gave a good account of themselves and held their opponents with virtually all the action taking place in the midfield.  Contrary to initial predictions that Uruguay might have an edge it turned out to be a very technical match that saw Egypt maintain 43% possession as against Uruguay’s 57%. Egypt Coach Héctor Cúper not wanting to take further risk with star man Mohammed Salah chose to keep him on the bench. His teammates nonetheless held their own but it was late Jose Gimenez header that broke the ice in the 89th minute. Prior to that decisive goal an shot from outside the 18 from Cavani would have sealed the victory earlier than the 89th minute. Uruguay now face Saudi Arabia in Group A on Wednesday in Volgograd at 4pm, while Egypt face Russia on Tuesday evening at 7pm in St Petersburg.
