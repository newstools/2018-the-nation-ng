Championship club Stoke City has announced the signing of Nigeria international Oghenekaro Etebo from Portuguese setup Feirense for a fee of 7.2 million euros. The former Warri Wolves’ star has put pen to paper on a five-year deal that will keep him at the Potters until June 30, 2023. Etebo spent the second half of last season on loan at Las Palmas but decided not to make the move permanent after the club was demoted to the second tier of Spanish football. ”We are delighted Etebo has chosen to join Stoke City, becoming our first signing of the summer,” Chief Executive Tony Scholes told Stoke City’s official website. ”I’m particularly pleased that he took the time to look beyond our current league status and understand who we are as a club before choosing us ahead of current Premier League and Bundesliga clubs.” Manager Gary Rowett added: ”We’re really excited to have the deal over the line for Etebo. I’m looking forward to seeing him in a Stoke City shirt as I’m sure our supporters are too.” The 22-year-old was a second-half substitute in Nigeria’s 1-2 loss to England in a pre-World Cup friendly staged at Wembley on June 2.
