Butchers from the 11 local governments and 14 local council development areas (LCDAs) in Ibadan, Oyo State, have cried out that their relocation to Amosun village in Akinyele Local Government will cause crisis between them and the Hausa cattle rearers. The butchers, addressing reporters at the weekend at a news conference held in collaboration with the Veteran Organisation for Human Rights Initiative (VOHRI) in Ibadan, said the relocation would cause more harm than good. The Chairman of the National Union of Butchers (NUB), Aare Latosa LCDA, Alhaji Ganiyu Olobo and his colleagues from Egbeda Local Government, Alhaji Mukaila Otedola; Ibadan North Council, Mr. Kehinde Oladejo; Ido LCDA, Mr. Alidu Tajudeen; Akinyeke Local Government, Alhaji Oroyinyin Adeleke; Ibadan South West, Mr. Adebayo Wasiu and Mr. Sheriff Iyanda, who spoke on behalf of their colleagues, said Amosun village was very close to Akinyele town where many Hausa cattle rearers lived. They feared that the closeness would lead to a crisis between them and the Hausa cattle rearers. The butchers, urging Governor Abiola Ajimobi to allow them continue their trade in their locations, said it was the clash in 2000 between them and the cattle rearers that made ex-Governor Lam Adesina to relocate the Hausa to Akinyele town. They alleged that the relocation, masterminded by some elements in the union, in connection with a firm, would cause crisis due to the closeness of Akinyele town and Amosun village to the proposed abattoir. The butchers recalled that Governor Ajimobi, during their meeting with him, ordered that butchers were free to operate anywhere convenient for them. A VOHRI leader, Comrade Sakirullah Ayobami and General Secretary, Comrade Adekunle Abimbola, said although private ownership of abattoir was allowed, coercion of butchers to move to the village was illegal.
