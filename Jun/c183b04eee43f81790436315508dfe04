A stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Delta State, Olorogun Otega Emerhor, on Wednesday night, declared that President Muhammadu Buhari has done well in Delta State more than former President Goodluck Jonathan, who hails from the zone. He spoke with State House correspondents after meeting with the Chief of Staff to the President, Abba Kyari. On what are the chances of Buhari in the Southsouth, Emerhor said,:”In 2015, we had President Jonathan who is from the south south, that created an emotional issue but we have seen now that even when Jonathan was in power, he did not do for Delta what President Buhari has done for us. “The Ogoni cleaning exercise that is going on there is one of the major thing we can count on. The east west road is being completely rehabilitated and that did not happen when one of our own son was the President. “So, we are very very confident that the south south this time around wants to belong to the center and that is why we are going to be able to deliver the President there.” Optimistic that the APC can take over the reins of leadership in Delta State from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he said that the current Governor off the State has not done enough thus, clearing the coast for the APC to take over.
