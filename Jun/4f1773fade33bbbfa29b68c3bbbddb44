A former Governor of Edo State, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, has described the post-humous award for the proclaimed winner of the June 12 Presidential election, Chief MKO Abiola, as a boost for the nation’s democracy. Comrade Oshiomhole who is an aspirant for the National chairmanship position of the All Progressive Congress said democracy day was not the day people hand over power to their successors. In a press statement issued in Bénin City, Oshiomhole said the decision to immortalize Abiola is what many Nigerians have yearned for. According to the statement, “I am glad with the decision of the President especially by declaring June 12 as Democracy day because the real democracy is not the day that people hand over power to their successors but the day to celebrate heroes of our democracy such as Chief Abiola and Gani Fawehinmi. “It was as a result of the struggle by Gani and Abiola that some persons came to benefit as leaders later on. That is why I commend Mr President for this great wisdom; this is the best way to honour those that labour for this democracy. “We know some leaders who even though they came from the same zone with Abiola and Gani were resolute in ensuring that June 12 was not declared as a day we celebrate our democracy. These men are known for their struggle for a better Nigerian and the blood of those who fought and died for this democracy has been atoned for this great decision by Mr President. “I congratulate the families of late MKO and Gani, I congratulate APC for making this happen. This was what some of us has yearned for over the years but I am glad that God has used Mr President to achieve this and this will further strengthen our democracy and make us greater” he stated.
