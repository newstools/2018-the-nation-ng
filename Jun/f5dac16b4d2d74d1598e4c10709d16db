THE Lagos State government, at the weekend, wielded the big stick on Total Filling Station in Akoka for alleged pollution of water resources. Environment Commissioner Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti said the government’s attention was drawn to the issue after the filling station reported the leakage of its underground tank to the authorities. This, he explained, caused anxiety in some quarters about the pollution of water sources in the community. He said the government  promptly intervened through the Lagos State Environmental Protection Agency (LASEPA), which prompted the filling station to correct the leakage and stop further pollution of the environment. “Going forward, we have directed that an Environmental Forensic Audit be immediately carried out to determine the exact source and extent of the pollution,” he said. Durosinmi-Etti also directed the closure of the filling station, pending the outcome of the audit, adding that the government would not hesitate to take any measure to protect the health and well-being of the citizens. He called for the decommissioning of boreholes installed by the filling station as palliative for the affected residents, urging the management to liaise with the Lagos Water Corporation for the supply of pipe –borne water to the affected residents, while further findings on the pollution are ongoing. The LASEPA had been mandated to monitor and ensure the implementation of the directives given to the fuel station.
