The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) yesterday condemned the attack in Plateau State by suspected herdsmen which left more than 80 people dead. In a statement in Enugu, the association condoled with the affected families, government and people of Plateau and urged the Federal Government to urgently address the issue of killings in the country. The National Public Relations Officer of the association, Mr Bestman Okoroafor, said:  “With great sadness, the leadership of NANS joins the world and fellow Nigerians in condemning the gruesome murder in some states of the federation, especially the most recent killings in Plateau by suspected herdsmen. The association, however, expressed concern that such killing had continued in spite of its repeated appeals to end the problem. “NANS is appealing to Mr President to stand by his promise of protecting human rights and fighting human rights abuses, “ Okoroafaor said. According to him, NANS is not unaware of President Muhammadu Buhari’s claim that desperate politicians are responsible for the killings. The association called on politicians to shun politics of bloodshed, adding that ‘’we remain one big and happy family in Nigeria.’’
