Lagos State Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgal has redeployed the Officer-in-Charge of the Anti-Cultism Squad SP Godwin Agbegbe, a Superintendent (SP). A Chief Superintendent (CSP) Akaninyene Etuk has been directed to take over from him. The move, according to the spokesman for the command, Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), is to reposition and reinvigorate the command’s, Anti-Cultism Squad. Oti said: “All members of the squad were relieved of their duty posts and have been directed to report to the Lagos State Police Headquarters for debriefing.  The reorganisation of the squad was necessitated by unprofessional conducts of its personnel and corruption in the unit. It is also to revitalise the outfit, believed to be very crucial in the fight against cultists and cultism in the state by infusing it with fresh blood for better service delivery. “The CP Lagos warns that the same treatment awaits any other unit in the command that is working at cross purposes with the fundamental objectives of the Nigeria Police Force. He added that Area Commanders, Divisional Police Officers and Heads of Departments must increase supervision of their men in order to ensure non-violation of the police Standard Operating Procedure (SOP). “Members of the public with useful information about the activities of cultists in any part of the state are encouraged to reach CSP Etuk on  08034448617.”
