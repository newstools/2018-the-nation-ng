A statement from the Saudi Football Federation said no-one was hurt after a ‘minor technical malfunction’. “The Saudi Football Federation wishes to reassure everyone about the safety of all members of the mission of the national team after a minor technical malfunction in one of the engines. “The plane landed a few minutes ago at Rostov on Don Airport, and UNOMIG personnel are now safely heading to their residence.”
