The late Bashorun Moshood Abiola’s former personal assistant, Lisa Olu Akerele, last night described the honour done the late Abiola as “a welcome development long overdue.” “Mr Kola Abiola, myself and other well-meaning individuals have been campaigning underground for years for this hounor to be done. The god thing is that it has taken a former soldier like President Muhammadu Buhari to right the wrong done by a misguided soldier like Gen. Ibrahim Babangida.”
