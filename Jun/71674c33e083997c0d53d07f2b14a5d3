IT was all jubilation at the Abeokuta home of late Musibau Abiola, the late elder brother of MKO Abiola, on Wednesday night, following the news of the declaration of June 12 as Democracy Day henceforth. When The Nation visited the Abiola family home, the members were still in a joyous mood some minutes after nine o’ clock when the NTA network brought the news to their living room on Wednesday. Alhaja Kudirat Musibau, widow of Abiola’s elder brother, told The Nation that she heard the news on the NTA network news and instantly went into a frenzy without waiting to hear the details. Mrs. Abiola said she dashed down from upstairs apartment to the basement shouting and jumping at the same time, calling other members of the family to come and hear what she heard. She said: “I heard over the NTA network news and couldn’t wait for the newscaster to conclude before jumping up in joy and calling on others to know if they also heard the news about Chief MKO Abiola and June 12. We all erupted into jubilation in the compound that Wednesday night. “We have long waited for the good news but didn’t expect it will come from this government.”
