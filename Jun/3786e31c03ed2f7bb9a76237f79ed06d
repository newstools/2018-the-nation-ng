Titled Cold Meters, the new episode emphasises the need for effective and efficient service delivery by public corporations and the need for the public to reciprocate the gesture by paying their bills as and when due. It highlights how members of the public resort to sabotaging public companies through non-payment of bills, destruction of their tools or tampering with devices installed to determine charges in response to poor services rendered. In trying to find everlasting solutions to the constant problem between public corporations and the general public, the following posers were raised in Cold Meters: Should consumers pay for epileptic services? Can anyone justify the huge sums claimed by electricity distribution companies? If consumers donâ€™t pay for services, how will the service providers sustain the services?
