Members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Oke-Ogun zone of Oyo State on Saturday held a mega solidarity rally to declare support for Governor Abiola Ajimobi. The rally, which was attended by all the local government and LCDA chairmen in the zone, the state party executive, government functionaries, political appointees from the region, women groups and thousands of party members, drawn from each of the ten local governments of Oke Ogun, held at Saki, the headquarters of Saki West local government. Addressing the party members at the event, the State Commissioner for Works and Transport, Wasiu Dauda, said the rally was organised to show their support for the outcomes of the recently conducted APC congresses in the state. He said that the National Working Committee of the party has cleared the air about the purported parallel congresses staged by some aggrieved party members by inaugurating the Akin Oke-led state executive committee. He assured the people that the NWC only recognised the  congress which held at the Lekan Salami Sports Complex because it was the only congress conducted by the Congress Committees set up by the National  leaders of the party. He added that although few people might be been very unsatisfied with the outcome, the rule of the game in any democracy is that the majority will always have their way. In his address, the Oke Ogun APC leader, Chief Samuel Adekola, appealed to the members of APC Unity Forum to drop their intention of decamping to another party. He boasted that APC would win convincingly in Oyo state come 2019 general elections. A party leader from Iwajowa local government area, Chief Adeleke Aduronibioda, said the Oke Ogun APC is waxing stronger day by day and is formidable to beat the opposition parties in the 2019 general elections.
