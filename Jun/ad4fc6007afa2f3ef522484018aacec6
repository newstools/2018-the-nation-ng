Gernot Rohr has promised to knock the Super Eagles into top shape before the team leaves Austria for Russia on Monday. The Nigerian senior national team lost two friendly matches in quick succession against England and Czech Republic but Rohr said yesterday’s training has showed that the players have made improvement after last Wednesday’s defeat. The ex- coach of Niger stated that the last days in the team’s camp in Austria will be tough for the players. “We are working very hard. We have time now for concentration before our first match against Croatia. “Playing Czech Rep  was not easy for us because in between that match and that of England, we used four days to travel. “After that, we have to recover and change our tactics. Now, we can work physically, technically and tactically. “We are going to make use of the remaining days in Austria to work very hard in our training sessions. We will train twice everyday until we leave for Russia on Monday.” He was, however, satisfied with the level of commitment displayed by the players assuring that the team would be ready to do the country proud in Russia when the World Cup begins. “Today, I’m so happy with the commitment of the team. The players are improving and we will be ready because we have a week to finalise our preparation,” Rohr stated.
