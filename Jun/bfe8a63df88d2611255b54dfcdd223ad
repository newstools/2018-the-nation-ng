GOAL! URUGUAY 2-1 PORTUGAL (Cavani 62) WHAT A GOAL! Uruguay are back in front after Portugal’s defence make a mess of a clearance, allowing Bentancur a run at the back four. And the Juventus midfielder’s brilliant pass picks out Cavani’s run, with the PSG forward then curling an unstoppable effort past a diving Patricio from the left edge of the area. GOAL! URUGUAY 1-1 PORTUGAL (Pepe 55) Portugal are level as from a short corner worked to Guerreiro, the full back whips the ball in from the left-hand touchline straight on to the head of the unmarked Pepe. And the experienced centre back was going to miss from six yards out. GOAL! URUGUAY 1-0 PORTUGAL (Cavani 7) Wow, what a start as Uruguay take an early lead after a lovely flowing move sees Suarez pick up possession of the ball near the right touchline. And the Braca forward whips in a gorgeous ball to the far post, where Cavani rises high to head the ball home. In fact,I think that has come off the PSG striker’s face.
