The executive members of the Lagos State branch of Senior Secondary School for Science (S4) Etiti, Imo State, Old Students  Association, acknowledged their members for what they called their “enormous support and encouragement so far.” In a press release signed by the secretary of the association, the pioneer set – 1990 – and 2000 set were appreciated for their “wonderful hospitality” during their April 2018 meet up. The release urged other old school members to be a part of the family. “Finally, we encourage those who are yet to identify with us to do so as there are many things to benefit from the alumni association.”
