The Benue State Government yesterday confirmed that some Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the state have started returning to their homes. Information and Orientation Commissioner, Lawrence Onoja, told reporters in Makurdi, the state capital, that since the commencement of the military operation on May 18, “the spate of attacks has reduced, with the invaders chased away, allowing some of those displaced to return to their homes, though their homes were reduced to rubble and their means of livelihood destroyed.” He added: ”This feat is being achieved at a great expense, with some of those involved in the operation paying the supreme sacrifice while others have suffered various degrees of injuries.” He hailed “these gallant patriots, who have demonstrated unequalled commitment to providing security for their fatherland, as well as all the families who have lost loved ones.” He commended  President Muhammadu Buhari for “responding to our call to upgrade and replace the military exercise, Ayem Akpatuma, with a full scale military operation.” He said the state’s request to the federal government  was necessitated by “the need to flush out blood- thirsty herdsmen militia who invaded several communities in the state since January.” He said the  State Emergency Management Agency registered more than 180, 000 displaced persons which “it has been catering for in eight camps while over 500, 000 IDPs are taking shelter wherever they find space.”
