Nigerian-born midfield dazzler, Dele Alli could be the one to stun the Super Eagles on Saturday, when he lines out for his country of birth, England, in an international friendly against the Super Eagles, according to his teammate at Tottenham Hotspur, Harry Kane. Heading into the game at Wembley Stadium, England’s new captain has hailed Alli’s ability to spring a surprise and change the game in a second, which he believes would come in handy against Nigeria. The pair have played together for three seasons and statistics show that 14 of Dele’s 26 assists have been for Kane, who says Nigeria will feel the whiz kid’s fury on Saturday. Alli, 22, scored nine goals and was responsible for 10 assists – his highest assist tally yet – as The Lilly Whites finished third in the Premier League season. Kane, who was named the captain of England leading the squad to Russia, said he is confident that his Spurs teammate’s game-changing ability can benefit Three Lions at the World Cup. Alli has scored just twice in 23 games for England and, though his last coming in a 2-0 win over Malta in October 2016, Kane says the former Milton Keynes Dons youngster is still reliable. The England captain then went on to urge their fans to remember his compatriot’s relatively tender years, which is belied by his dazzling effects, as evidenced by his brace in a 3-1 win over Chelsea in April. Kane declared emphatically: “Dele has scored goals, assisted goals and he’s a game-changer. He has that ability where he can change a game in a second. “You saw that earlier this season at Stamford Bridge with his great run, great touch and a great finish to win us the game. In the big moments in the big games, he’s there – and he enjoys those moments.” “I think sometimes people lose sight of his age. He just has to stay positive, keep doing what he’s doing year after year and be consistent – that’s most important.”
