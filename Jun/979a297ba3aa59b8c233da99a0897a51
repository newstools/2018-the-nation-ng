Suspected Fulani herdsmen killed three Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) policemen and eight farmers in Mararaba Udege, Aisa and Aguma communities in Nasarawa Local Government Area of Nasarawa State, it was learnt yesterday. Houses were burnt and the communities have been deserted. The incident happened on June 3. It was gathered that the policemen were on their way to quell the crisis between the Agatu people and Fulani herdsmen when they were ambushed. Police spokesman Ismaila Usman, who confirmed this, said the conflict erupted after an Agatu man shot a Fulani and stole his motorcycle. He said: “As the Fulani launched a reprisal, the police was called in. But unfortunately, our men were ambushed and three were killed. “One Inspector, a sergeant and a corporal were victims of the attack and no arrest has been made.” Usman added that normalcy has returned to the affected areas as a team of policemen, headed by an Assistant Commissioner of Police, had been deployed there to maintain order. Bodies of the deceased had been recovered and deposited at an undisclosed mortuary. The Paramount Ruler of Agatu Chiefdom, Alhaji Ahmed Kwanaki, identified the dead farmers as Sale Ozala, Oyigoso Sale, Danladi Joko, Abdulahi Musa, Adamu Haruna, Musa Adamu, Yakubu Sale, and Shehu Sabo (Bassa man). Kwanaki appealed to the state and Federal Government to deploy military men in the area to stem the attacks. According to him, security operatives earlier deployed in the area were overpowered by the herdsmen as they could not move to the interior where the killings happened. Chairman of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) Husseini Mohammed condemned the attacks and promised to help in arresting the perpetrators. He said: “If the perpetrators are Fulani, we would expose them and ensure they face the law. “Agatu people should also expose the criminals among them to end the crisis.”
