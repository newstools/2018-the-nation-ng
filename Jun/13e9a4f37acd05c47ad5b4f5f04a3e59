FOR Hajia Mairo Tambuwal, this is no better time to put smiles on the faces of women in Sokoto State. In order to ensure that child and maternal mortality is drastically reduced, if not eliminated, the governor, Aminu Tambuwal, and his wife recently flagged off the Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn child, Adolescent Health Plus Nutrition (RMNCAH+N) in the state. The couple also inaugurated the revitalised primary health care and birth right labour room at Gagi town, Sokoto south local government area. It will be recalled that the wife of the president and founder of Future Assured, Mrs. Aisha Buhari, has encouraged wives of governors to make commitment towards championing the improvement of RMNCAH+N in Nigeria. It was in line with this commitment that the Sokoto State’s first lady, who is also the Sokoto State RMNCAH+N champion, initiated the flag off of the programme, which is designed to cover the 23 local government areas of Sokoto State. The governor’s wife attributed the successful turnout of the event to God. She also expressed her gratitude to her husband, who in spite of his tight schedule attended the memorable event. Hajia Tanbuwal also announced to the gathering the distribution of over 2000 mobile phones to community-based healthcare volunteers in the state, to enhance sensitisation and social mobilisation activities.
