The Buhari Patriotic Movement (BPM) yesterday called on the media to be more circumspect in their reports as the 2019 general elections draw closer. Historically, BPM said, the media have been an important pillar of democratic successes recorded in the country. BPM National Women Leader Saada Baba Mohammed in a statement enjoined the media to be more cautious in treating information available from different partisan sources. She said: “As 2019 draws near and people become more entrenched in their partisan political views, the media will be increasingly called upon to play their constitutional role of society watchdog. They should provide a good context and background to stories to enable citizens make informed choices on them. “The media have sacrificed a lot for the successes recorded in the previous and current democratic dispensations in Nigeria. Numerous journalists were victims of political assassinations, detentions without trial, forced exile, loss of jobs through proscription of media houses. Therefore, the media have an important stake like any other institution in the society to protect the gains of this democratic dispensation.”
