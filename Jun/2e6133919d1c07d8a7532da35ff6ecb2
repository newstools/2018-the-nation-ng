Twenty five years after the election widely believed to have been won by the late MKO Abiola was held, high profile comedian and United Nations Millennium Development Goals ambassador, Francis Agoda, popularly known as I Go Dye has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to declare the results. Describing the president’s recent conferment of the title of GCFR on the late Abiola as worthy of praise, the comedian posited that it can only be completed if the country’s number one citizen uses his executive power to direct the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to declare the results of the 1993 presidential election, annulled by then Head of State, Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida (IBB) and widely adjudged to have been won by the late Abiola. In an open letter, the humour merchant advised President Buhari that announcing the result of the annulled election would be the biggest achievement of his administration in its fight against corruption. “The recent announcement on the June 12 issue cannot be complete without stating the final results of the elections,” he wrote, describing the gesture as potentially the biggest achievement of this administration in its fight against corruption. The award-winning comedian highlights the effects of the annulment on the psyche of Nigerians, saying it made the people lose confidence in successive elections. He therefore advised the President to do the needful to make people believe in the electoral process yet again. The comedian concluded by advising the President not to let another take the shine off him by completing what he had started.
