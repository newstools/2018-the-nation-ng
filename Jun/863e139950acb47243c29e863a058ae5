A Federal High Court in Abuja on Wednesday fixed September for judgement on a suit filed by the Inspector -General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, against the Senate and its President, Bukola Saraki. Justice John Tsoho chose the date after listening to IGP’s lawyer, Alex Izinyon (SAN), argued on behalf of his client and urged the court to grant the plaintiff’s prayers. Idris is challenging the propriety of the May 9 resolution of the Senate, describing him as ” enemy of democracy and unfit to hold any public office within and outside Nigeria.” He is praying the court to, among others, quash the resolution of the Senate because it lacks the powers to declare him unfit to hold public office in Nigeria or elsewhere.
