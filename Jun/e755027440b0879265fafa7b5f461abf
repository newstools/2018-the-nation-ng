Justice Olusola Williams remanded the defendant after pleading not guilty to a two count charge of false pretenses and forgery preferred against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). EFCC prosecutor, Mrs. Zainab Ettuh, told the court that the defendant had in his possession a document containing false pretence captioned “Special Power of Attorney” purported to have emanated from one Peter Raymond addressed to a lawyer regarding a case. Mrs. Ettuh asked the court to take the defendant’s plea for trial to commence. Badmus pleaded not guilty to the charge.
