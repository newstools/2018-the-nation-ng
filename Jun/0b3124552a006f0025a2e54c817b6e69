Lagos High Court yesterday heard that two men, Dare Ogunrotimi and Kola Ali, allegedly beat their friend Promise Okon to death. Okon’s sister, Chioma, made this known while testifying in Ogunrotimi and Ali’s trial before Justice Adedayo Akintoye. The defendants were arraigned on June 5, on a one-count charge of manslaughter. According to the prosecution counsel, Mr Sunmonu Babatunde, Ogunrotimi and Ali committed the offence at about 6pm on February 10, 2016, on Anthony Ezemoke Street, Oke-Ira, Ajah, Lagos. Chioma, the first prosecution witness, alleged that the duo beat Promise up in his house till he could no longer move. The court heard that Promise was rushed to a hospital where he began vomiting black, watery substance. “He was discharged from the hospital on February 13, 2016 but he died the next day, February 14, 2016,” Chioma said. According to her, the “excessive beating” given to Promise by the defendants, caused his death. Under cross-examination by defence counsel Mr Melvin Obadah, Chioma said she did not witness the beating, rather the deceased’s neighbour narrated the incident to her. Justice Akintoye adjourned till October 30.
