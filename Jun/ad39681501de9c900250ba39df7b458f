The Association of Waste Managers of Nigeria AWAM, better known as PSP Waste Operators, has accused the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI), of sabotaging their efforts to rid the state of refuse. Its chairman, Oladipo Egbeyemi, in a statement, accused CLI of advising residents, community and religious leaders to stop paying PSP Operators for clearing their wastes. It also accused the agency of threatening that only operators contracted by Visionscape would be considered to be legally operating. The group claimed that CLI, through its action, was undermining the efforts of Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu in finding a lasting solution to the waste management crisis in the state. “You will recall that in a widely publicised statement following our protest to Tinubu’s residence on April 27, Asiwaju Tinubu promised to resolve it. This was followed by a briefing by the Ministry of Environment on May 2, where the government said that the PSP Operators will resume the responsibility of residential waste collection,” Egbeyemi said. Special Adviser to the governor on the Environment, Babatunde Hunpe said the ministry would resolve the matter.
