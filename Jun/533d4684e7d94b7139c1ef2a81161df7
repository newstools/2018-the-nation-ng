Ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, German tactician, Gernot Rohr has declared that he knows his Super Eagles’ starting XI, NationSport has learnt. In recent warm-up matches, Nigeria has lost two and drawn one out of three and will be involved in another friendly against the Czech Republic on tomorrow before flying to Russia. However, the former Burkina Faso Coach, who announced his 23-man final list for the Mundial after the 2-1 friendly loss to England on Saturday, is confident of a good outing in Russia, especially as he is armed with the vital knowledge of Eagles’ group opponents heading to the Mundial. ‘I know my starting 11 for the first game of the World Cup,’ Rohr said. ‘I have kept faith with the players that helped us during the qualifiers. I can only change in case of injuries. I collect videotapes of our opponents’ friendly matches and constantly watch them.’ Nigeria plays in Group D alongside Croatia, Iceland and Argentina at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
