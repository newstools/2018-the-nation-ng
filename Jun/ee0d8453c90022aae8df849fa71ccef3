NATIONAL Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB) Registrar /Chief Executive Prof. Ifeoma Isuigo-Abanihe has been suspended. Prof. Isuigo-Abanihe was suspended along with four other officials of the agency over allegations of contract splitting and other offences. According to a report, their suspension was done in accordance with the zero-tolerance stance of President Muhammadu Buhariâ€™s administration for corruption. The officials are: Mr. Nnasia Ndarake Asanga (Director, Finance and Accounts), Dr. Obinna M. Opara (Director, Examination Administration), Alhaji Jimoh Adewola Kasali (Director, Examinations Development) and Edwin Osamo, an engineer, (Procurement Officer). The letter conveying their suspension with Ref No: NABTEB/GB/CH/RCE/S001 was obtained by The Nation. It was signed by the Chairman, Governing Board of NABTEB, Prof. Karshima Shilga and dated June 21, 2018. According to the letter, the Governing Board of NABTEB ordered their suspension following the outcome of a Special Investigative Panel setup by the board. The special investigative panel report noted that it uncovered irregularities in contract awards and abuse of office by the embattled registrar. The panel ordered the registrar to refund N49, 779,262.50 immediately to the coffers of NABTEB because she could not account for how the money was spent. Efforts to get the embattled registrar to comment on the development proved abortive as her phone line was unreachable and reply to text messages sent to her phone as at 5:14pm was still been awaited as at press time.
