Morocco on Wednesday failed in its bid to host the 2016 FIFA World Cup, losing to joint bid from United States, Mexico and Canada. The FIFA delegates who were in Moscow, Russia, voted overwhelmingly – 134-65 and with only one neutral vote – in favour of the three-nation joint bid which had been in the lead in the run-up to the vote. Morocco’s loss was its fifth and the bid had been destined to fail even before the vote at the Moscow Expocentre, following the pre-vote report by FIFA technical officials. When both bid leaders were given a last chance to make their case with 15-minute presentations in front of congress, the pledge on financial returns widened the gap. The North Americans had pledged to generate $11 billion profit, while Morocco could only pledge $5 billion profit. The 2026 tournament will feature 48 teams as against the current 32. NAN
