The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has advised motorists to drive with care on roads undergoing rehabilitation to avoid accidents and unnecessary loss of lives. Mr Clement Oladele, the FRSC Sector Commander, Ogun Command, gave the advice in an interview with the our reporters on Monday in Ota, Ogun. Oladele explained that ongoing rehabilitation of roads in different parts of the country had led to increased activities of construction workers and heavy duty trucks on those highways. He listed some of the roads undergoing rehabilitation in parts of Ogun to include: Lagos – Ibadan expressway, Sagamu -Ijebu Ode, Abeokuta – Ibadan and Abeokuta -Ota – Lagos, Fidiwo, Ajebo/Alapako roads. According to him, on account of these construction and rehabilitation works, motorists are advised to maintain speed limits and should be extra vigilant, particularly where there are diversions and vehicles have to face oncoming traffic. “Motorists are enjoined to drive cautiously and avoid overtaking to prevent possible collision with vehicles travelling in opposite directions. “We also implore motorists to obey the maximum speed limits stipulated on the roads signs along the corridor,” he said. The sector commander also advised motorists to obey traffic regulations and follow instructions from FRSC patrol teams and other traffic agencies. NAN
