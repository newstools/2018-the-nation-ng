Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has praised the former Chairman of the Governing Council of Kaduna Polytechnic, Chief Sergeant Awuse, for his commitment to the development of the state. Speaking during a thanksgiving service in honour of Chief Awuse at the Saint Luke Anglican church, Emohua yesterday, Wike said God healed the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain because his services were needed by Rivers people. He said Awuse over the years proved that he was committed to the progress of the state and would never betray Rivers people. He said: “Chief Sergeant Awuse means a lot to us. He supports the growth of the state with all his strength.  If he is with you, go home and sleep. “He will never betray you in any way. We thank God that has healed him. We join his family and friends to bless God for his life”. Wike commended Awuse for the initiative to set up a foundation to tackle cancer in the state.  He said the state government will support the foundation. Awuse said he was in church to thank God for healing him after a surgery for cancer. He said he went through intensive treatment in a London Hospital where he spent four months. The former Chairman of the Governing Council of Kaduna Polytechnic said he was in church to publicly acknowledge God’s protection and also create awareness on the prevalence of cancer . “The highlight of my position is that God has healed me and I am well. I vowed  to assist people with similar condition,” Awuse. He said that several less  privileged Nigerians are dying due to poor health facilities and lack of information of health processes. Awuse said that he would set up a non-governmental organisation to tackle cancer and provide credible information to people.
