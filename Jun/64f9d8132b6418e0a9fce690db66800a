Ahead of the release of his sophomore album titled ‘Strings And Bling’ South African rapper has dropped two singles – ‘King’ and ‘Jungle.’ Produced by American beatsmith, Cody Rhones, ‘Jungle’ is a trap-happy song. It is also a meditation on the 031’s most wanted rapper’s experience of the concrete jungle that is Johannesburg. “The jungle is ekasi where anything and everything happens,” said Nasty C. “It’s where people live recklessly. There are no rules because you can do whatever you want. The jungle is also Joburg. A lot more stuff happens there than what happened when I used to be in Durban. Those two meanings are intertwined.” The other song, ‘King’ is produced by South Africa’s own Tweezy and it is a tongue-in-cheek look at misguided youth who refer to themselves as “young kings.” It features American rapper, A$AP Ferg, who recorded his verse during a visit to South Africa. “It’s not like I’m calling myself king,” explained Nasty C. “It’s about these kids who talk too much and I’m mocking the term ‘king’ because of how those guys call each other that.” On ‘King,’ Nasty C flexes about visiting places like Kenya and Ghana and waxes lyrical about feeding women jollof rice. Born Nsikayesizwe David Junior Ngcobo, Nasty C’s chart-topping single, Juice Back – spawned an international remix featuring Davido and Cassper Nyovest. In 2018, the artist who is also known as The Coolest Kid in Africa signed with Africa Creative Agency and Universal Music Group Africa.
