University of Ilorin Vice Chancellor Prof. Sulyman Abdulkareem has advised engineers to always approach their projects with an entrepreneurial mindset. Abdulkareem gave the advice in his welcome address at the fourth edition of the National Engineering Project Exhibition (EPEX), which held at the university. He explained that having an entrepreneurial mindset would help in solving the problems facing the nation and provide jobs for a large number of jobless and frustrated youth. “The VC pointed out that Nigeria and other countries are looking for solutions to their peculiar challenges and engineering projects are key ingredients of those solutions.’’ According to him, the exhibition is a platform to showcase and demonstrate the best of various innovative engineering projects undertaken by undergraduates in Nigeria. He said the programme was expected to stimulate the innovative and technical skills of students and to motivate them. “EPEX offers engineering students opportunities to develop independent critical thinking skills, collaborative working skills, oral and written communication and presentation skills as well as marketing skills, thereby building their confidence. “The programme is expected to reward the engineering students, and assure them that the society still values excellence,” he said. According to the VC, the undergraduate project is considered to be an important part of the engineering education process and one of the major processes of independent research that a student will undertake. “The engineering projects improve innovative spirit, make transformation of theory to applications possible, enrich  knowledge on renewing technologies, prepare you for career path, remind you of your responsibilities to your society, boost curiosities and love for studies and improve team building and problem-solving skills and many more,” he said.
