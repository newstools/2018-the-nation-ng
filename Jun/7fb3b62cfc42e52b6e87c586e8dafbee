The Nasarawa state chairman of Miyetty Allah cattle breeders association (MACBAN) has said that he will take legal action against any journalist that carries any report considered to be malicious to the Fulani tribe. The chairman, Husseini Muhammed made the threat following wide media report on the killing of three policemen and eight Agatu farmers in Mararaba-Udege, in Nasarawa local government area of Nasarawa state. While reacting to the involvement of Fulani herdsmen in the killings in Lafia on Thursday, he said his association is ready to sue any journalist who dares to involve Fulani herdsmen in their report in the event of any killings”. “Why should the word Fulani herdsmen be used anytime there are killings of people? That amounts to criminalizing the entire Fulani tribe and we will not take that again”. “The media is the one fueling this hatred against the Fulani people and we will sue any journalist whose report reflects this henceforth,” Husseini said. “We are not in support of any Fulani man who kill or involved in any criminal activities, the police should arrest and prosecute any Fulani man if caught”. “Other tribes like the Niger Delta people started the kidnapping but nobody mentions Niger Delta whenever a kidnapper is arrested, but whenever killing is committed then it is the Fulani herdsmen, we can’t take this anymore”. The association, therefore, cautioned reporters to desist from using the word Fulani herdsmen in the event of any killings else it will engage them in a legal battle.
