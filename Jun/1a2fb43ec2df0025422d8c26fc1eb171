A LEADING aspirant for Oyo State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship ticket, Chief Michael Adeniyi Akintola (SAN), has described the victory of the party’s national chairman, former Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole, as birth of a new dawn. The former Labour leader was affirmed as APC national chairman through voice votes by delegates at the national convention conducted at the weekend in Abuja. Akintola, in a statement, said he was convinced that Oshiomhole was coming to take charge at the party’s national secretariat at an auspicious time when the party was in dire need of a tested team player imbued with the administrative skills to galvanise the party’s faithful ahead of the 2019 general elections. He said: “Your Excellency, I am very happy to congratulate you on your election as the national chairman of our great party, the APC. “You could not have come at a better time than now that the party needs your wealth of experience. “Your adoption without any opposition eloquently attests to your immense leadership qualities, experience and character, all of which will combine to foster unity and give our great party the much-needed direction to unassailable victory in the coming elections in 2019. “It is truly the birth of a new dawn for the party and our dear country Nigeria.”
