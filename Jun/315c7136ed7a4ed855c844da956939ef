Team Nigeria continues its quest for promotion in the Africa Zone Group III of the 2018 Davis Cup championship, as the Abdul-Mumin Babalola-captained side battles Cameroun for Group A supremacy. After brushing Rwanda aside 3-0, in their first tie, Nigeria will be aiming to top the group ahead of the Benin Republic which had also defeated Cameroun 2-1 to be in contention for the leadership of the group with Nigeria. With the fine form of Sylvester Emmanuel, Joseph Imeh Ubon and Christian Paul, Nigeria may be on its way to the elite division this year. Nigeria topped Benin’s winning margin by brushing aside Rwanda 3-0 without dropping a set. Nigeria is the early leaders of e group, with the Benin Republic in second, while winless teams – Cameroun and Rwanda teams have more work to do. When Nigeria will be taking on Cameroun, Benin Republic will also be slugging it out with Rwanda. Namibia yesterday beat Mozambique on the clay courts of the Nairobi Club to take advantage of Kenya’s rest day and hit the summit of Group B. Victory propelled Namibia above Kenya, the group’s only other undefeated side, in the Pool B standings. Namibia, however, have played a tie more than any other team in the group and they face Kenya in a crunch tussle tomorrow. Mozambique, meanwhile, are rooted to the foot of the pool having failed to win a single rubber in their two ties so far. Algeria chalked up their first success of the 2018 Davis Cup after dispatching Uganda 2-1. The winner of each pool will play off against the runner up of the other pool to determine which two nations are promoted to Group II in 2019.
