 Super Falcons have  sealed their qualifiers for the 11th Africa Women Cup of Nations finals with an emphatic 6-0 victory over the Scorpions of Cambia at the Agege Stadium on Monday.  Four goals from Nigeria international, Desire Oparanozie and a brace from Asissat  Oshoala gave the Falcons a comfortable victory to defend their title in Ghana later in the year. Head coach, Thomas Dennerby opted for an attacking line that produced two goals in the first half and four goals in the second half. The first goal was a spot kick that was converted by Desire three minutes into the match, Assist scored the second goal in the 22nd minutes. Desire also made it early when the second 45 minutes resumed as she hit again 6 minutes into the half, Oshoala registered her second half 10minutes after to increase the tally to four. Rampaging Desire added two more goals before the end 90 minutes. Though there was no Most Valuable Players for the match as none was announced, Super Falcons performance was however described by some as impressive but with room for more tactical discipline. “They are always African Champions. Today’s match is a testimony to that. But I think they still need to improve to be fit for a world cup test” said  Mike Maiyaki, a sport analyst with SuperbSport
