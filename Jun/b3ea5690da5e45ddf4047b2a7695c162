The Nigeria Tennis Federation (NTF) has named a four-man team for this month’s Davis Cup Championships holding in Nairobi, Kenya. Nigeria will be competing in Africa Zone Division III alongside host – Kenya; Algeria, Benin Republic, Cameroun, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda and Uganda between June 18 to 23, on clay outdoor at the Nairobi Club. Davis Cup veteran – Abdul-mumin Babalola will be the non-playing captain, while others are Christian Paul, Joseph Imeh Ubon and Sylvester Emmanuel. Aside from Christian Paul who replaces Clifford Enosoregbe from the team that finished fifth at 2017 edition held in Egypt, the team remains intact and is expected to commence camping this week in Ibadan in readiness for a promotion quest this year. To finish fifth in 2017, the team defeated Algeria 2-0 after losing 3-0 and 2-1 to Zimbabwe in Pool A to miss out from the promotion race. But the team managed to beat Rwanda 3-0 to set up a classification clash against Algeria who also finished third in Pool B. For 2018, the team will be making another attempt at getting back to the elite division again this year after several attempts in the last five years. NTF President, Dayo Akindoju has assured that the team would get the needed support to excel in the tournament. “We are expecting the team to open camp in Ibadan where they will get used to the clay court, which they will play on in Kenya. We hope they can stay in camp before they depart for the tournament in Kenya. We are also hopeful that the selected players will do the nation proud this year,” the NTF boss stated. The best outing for Nigeria at the Davis Cup was in 1988 and 1989 when the team reached the Group I semifinals.
