CANADA-BASED Nigerian artiste, Kelly Anthony Osaretin Osifo, simply known as Kelly Anthony has hit the Nigerian music scene with ‘Unstoppable’. The Edo State born artiste said his new single portrays him as a force that can’t be stopped. “Unstoppable is a rhythm we can all relate to, because we all have been through the struggles and hustles of life,” said Anthony. The artiste says that he realized his passion for music when he was 11 years, when he fell in love with R Kelly’s music. When his mother noticed his passion for music, she had him enrolled in the church choir. It was ultimately from there he learnt how to sing. Subsequently, he had his first solo performance in front of a congregation at his school talent show. Influenced by top musicians like R. Kelly, Akon, Mavin Gaye and Jay Z, Kelly cites his greatest challenge as dishonesty from producers who take artistes for a ride. “I want to however see the world gravitate towards my music,” Anthony said. “It basically shows that my hard work is starting to pay off. My goal for my image is to be a great role model to all my young Africans and others across the world. I want to teach them to never give up on their dreams and to stand tall and work hard for what they believe in.”
