Worried by the rising youth unemployment in the country, experts have suggested proven solution to tackle the menace. Firing the first salvo, the Managing Director/CEO of Gr8jobsng Mrs. Omomene Odike said the number of unemployable youths will continue to rise if the right skills are not acquired. She said the scourge of unemployment had become endemic in the country. Odike spoke at the official unveiling of Learning Management System (LSM), a product of Gr8jobsng, which provides online skills to millions of Nigerians seeking employment. She added that most people seeking employment do not know how to go about it, stressing that inability to apply the right skills was responsible for the huge poverty in the country. According to her, LSM is out to expose job seekers to face interviews, where to seek employment and how people would discover what they can do to take them off the streets. ”The rate of unemployable youths has increased as lots of youths lack the right skills, information and exposure to be employable. “I must say that many youths are wasting their precious time not knowing where to find the jobs. Some even find the jobs but do not know have the skills to impress their employers when invited for interview. In that case they lose the jobs the moment they appear before panel of interviewers.” Speaking on unemployment, ace broadcaster Soni Irabor said the situation is growing at alarming proportion, noting that government and the private sectors must collaborate to salvage the situation. Irabor maintained that the LMS plays a vital role in preparing people on steps they should take to secure the jobs they applied for, adding that most job seeks get confused they moment they appear for interviews.
