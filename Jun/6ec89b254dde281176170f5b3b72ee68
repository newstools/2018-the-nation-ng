Leicester City defensive midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi is happy playing again for the Super Eagles of Nigeria after gaining full fitness. The lanky Nigerian international played his first international friendly against Czech Republic on Wednesday in Austria. Before the Czech game, Ndidi had missed out of the matches the Eagles played against Congo DR and England. After the team’s training at the Avita Resort pitch in Bad Tatzmannsdorf, Austria yesterday, Ndidi told NationSport that he was excited to be back playing again for the national team. “I feel good and excited returning to play for the Super Eagles. We are really enjoying ourselves” He began in the interview. “It’s great coming back to the team at this time when the World Cup is almost starting. I’m happy to play with my teammates.” Ndidi also allayed fears about the results of the team in recent friendly matches. “We may not have won our last three friendly games but as players, we understand what is at stake and we will surely rise to the occasion in Russia, which is much more important than results of friendly matches “We will try as much as possible to pick vital lessons from all the matches we lost and hopefully, everything will be alright in Russia” The defensive midfielder said the competition for starting places in the team has not made the 23 players to forget that the squad comes first before individual interest. “It’s about the team not really the contest to get starting shirts. We will all give 100 per cent support to any player picked by the coach to be in the first 11,” he added.
