With one voice, All Progressives Congress (APC) faithful in Alimosho Federal Constituency have pledged their support for the party, its elected and appointed leaders ahead of the 2019 elections. They renewed their loyalty to APC National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and vowed to work for the re-election of Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, Senator Olamilekan Adeola Solomon (YAYI) among others. Numbering in the thousands, they gathered on Monday on the grounds of the African Church Primary School, Mosan in Mosan-Okunola Local Council Development Area (LCDA) for their monthly Federal Constituency meeting. The meeting held against the backdrop of the Ward, Local Government and State congresses of last month that produced Chief Tunde Balogun as the Lagos State APC Party Chairman. Party leaders in attendance included the member representing Alimoso Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, Olufemi Adebanjo; the representative of Alimosho Constituency 1 at the Lagos State House of Assembly, Bisi Yusuf; APC State Organising Secretary Balogun Abdullahi Enilolobo and Special Adviser to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode on Housing, Mr Kehinde Joseph. Other senior members and leaders present included the six LCDA chairmen in Alimosho Local Government Area: Alimoso, Mosan-Okunola, Egbe-Idimu, Igando-Ikotun, Agbado-Oke Odo and Ayobo-Ipaja among others. Enilolobo, also known as the ‘Alimosho APC apex leader’ assured the party faithful that Alimosho “is intact and remains one united family”, adding that the party had commenced reconciliation moves with aggrieved members.
