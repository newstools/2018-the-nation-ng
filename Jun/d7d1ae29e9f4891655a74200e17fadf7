Czech Republic is not taking the encounter against Super Eagles for granted following their 4-0 bashing by Australia last Friday. To underscore the importance of the Eagles’ tie, the Czech Republic Head Coach, Karel Jarolim on Sunday studied the video of the Nigeria, England duel as they prepare to face the three-time African champion in Austria on June 6. A monitored report on www.radio.cz revealed that the Czechs are eager to go all out against the Eagles to redeem their image after their loss to Australia in the international friendly last Friday. “The Nigeria match presents fresh opportunity to express the potential of the national team. We are getting prepared, studied their game against England and videos,” Jarolim has said. Jarolim, former Czechoslovakia international footballer, has been seeking to reconstruct the team after failing to qualify for the World Cup and the retirement of many of country’s stars, including Tomas Rosicky and Petr Chech. Meanwhile, Coach Gernot Rohr is expected to play the Czechs with best 11 from the 23- man list already submitted to FIFA for the Russia World Cup. The German tactician is yet to secure victory from the last three World Cup build-up matches as England defeated Nigeria 2-1 at Wembley.
