With her movie, ‘The Ghost and the Tout’, still running across Nigerian cinemas, cross-over actress Toyin Abraham is over the moon with the new figure of sales recorded by the movie. The movie has been rated in some quarters as 2018’s highest selling movie by over N11m. “The last six months and the months preceding it have been nothing short of fantastic,” she said. “I got the new figure for The Ghost and the Tout and I almost cried. Not only have we sold more than the highest selling Nollywood movie this year, we have sold more than the highest selling movie this year by over 11million Naira. “I’m overwhelmed and grateful for loyal fans, good support-system, individuals and institutions that keep believing in me.” The actress who was with the first lady of Kwara State, last weekend for ‘ Greet & Meet’, also revealed that the officials of the mall and manager of Viva Cinemas confirmed that the turnout of crowd was unprecedented in the history of the establishment. Also on her feud with Mercy Aigbe, the actress has cleared the air stating that she is more focus on goal and the past is by-gone. “I am a product of grace. Even in my deepest moments of “mess-up” and deepest hole of hell, God found me and gave me a second chance and aligned my path with grace. Do I mess up sometimes? Yes. Like the Mercy Aigbe’s blip, it was an error in judgment on my part. I was wrong and way out of line. I’ve since reached out to Mercy and we have sorted our differences. “I am a product of grace today; we still had cause to communicate. I am truly sorry. It is time to focus on the goal and move on to something better than the past and the present.” The actress/producer who is spotted with a bold gold engagement ring also revealed that her new work Seven and A Half Date, will hit the cinemas on August 3rd, 2018.
