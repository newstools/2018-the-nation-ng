Two persons were found dead inside a cesspit on 176, Azikwe Road, Aba, Abia State. It was gathered that the deceased, identified as Chimamkpa and Orji, worked with a popular sewage disposal company and had gone to evacuate waste from the building’s cess pit. Different versions of their death have emerged, with some saying the deceased might have inhaled the disposal chemical and others attributing it to supernatural forces. However, a resident, simply identified as Ndubuisi, said after clearing the cess pit, one of the deceased came out through the pit’s manhole and tried to help his colleague out. Both of them however fell back into the pit and before help could come, both men were dead. He said: “The incident happened so sudden, it was like a magic. When the one outside fell back into the cess pit, people thought he would come out with his colleague. “But after waiting for a while and none of them came out, people decided to break the cover of the cesspit only to find the two men dead and police were called in immediately.” Efforts to reach the manager of the sewage disposal firm, identified as Mr. Amaobi, were unsuccessful. Police spokesman Geoffrey Ogbonna could not be reached for comments as at last night.
