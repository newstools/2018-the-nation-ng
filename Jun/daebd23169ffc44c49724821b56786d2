Romelu Lukaku scored twice as Belgium broke the resistance of a brave Panama side on their World Cup debut, securing a 3-0 victory in the opening match of Group G in the ongoing 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Dries Mertens shot home a superb volley two minutes into the second half, sending the ball arcing over Jaime Penedo after Panama struggled to clear a cross. Lukaku’s hard work up front was rewarded when he headed home Kevin De Bruyne’s brilliant pass off the outside off his foot to make it 2-0 in the 69th minute and the big striker latched on to an Eden Hazard pass to complete the scoring with a neat finish. The debutants suffered a shaky start as Lukaku went close for Belgium in the opening minute after an incisive pass from De Bruyne set Yannick Carrasco free down the left, but the striker fired wide. Despite being forced to spend much of the game defending, the Panamanians showed strength, speed and trickery when they did break forward, and they created chances of their own in a scoreless first half. The opening matches at the World Cup have seen Brazil and Argentina both draw their first games against Switzerland and Iceland respectively, with holders Germany losing to Mexico. But Belgium ensured there would be no upset at the Fisht Stadium with Mertens opening the scoring two minutes in, and as the underdogs started to chase an equalizer the space opened up.
