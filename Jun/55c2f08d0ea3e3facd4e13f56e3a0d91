Edo State government is to support the Federal Government in its planned ranching for cattle rearers. Officials of the state government kept mum on the issue but sources said plans were already at an advance stage on the areas where the ranches will be located. It was gathered that grasses would be planted at the ranches. Another source said land in some selected local government areas has been mapped out where the ranches will be built. The source said the plans by the State Government will end clashes between farmers and herders in the state. Part of the plan is also to monitor inflow of herders into the state. According to the source, “We want a situation where we have a dedicated spot where cattle can be taken to so that you know where to go to when you want to buy cow. “The planned ranching will not be the type people are thinking it will be. We want a landing bay where people bringing in cattle can go.”
