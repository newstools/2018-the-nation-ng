The Oyo State government has urged custodians of the Egungun Festival in the state not to renege on their promise of celebrating a festival devoid of violence and hooliganism. The government noted that peace, security and safety had been predominant during stakeholders’ meetings involving heads of masquerades across the state: the Olori Alaagba, the Aare Isese from the zones and custodians of the masquerades with government officials at the Ministry of Information, Culture and Tourism. It said representatives of the government’s security department always attended such meetings preceding this year’s Egungun season. In a joint statement by the Commissioner for Information, Culture and Tourism, Mr. Toye Arulogun and the Special Adviser to Governor Ajimobi on Community Relations, Alhaji Bidemi Siyanbade, the government said another stakeholders’ meeting will be held today at 12 noon to further deliberate and consolidate the modalities and conduct of masquerades during this year’s Egungun Festival. The statement said this would give it the prominence it deserves and promote the state’s rich cultural values and tourism potentials. The government said 23 of the 27 Egungun in the state had signed a non-violence pact with the police Command. It said the government had secured the commitment and readiness of security agencies to maintain peace, law and order during the festival. The government hailed the Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Adetunji, for keying into Governor Abiola Ajimobi’s peace initiative during the festival by admonishing the custodians of the masquerades (Egungun) to maintain peace and order.
