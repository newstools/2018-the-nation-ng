Fast becoming a social commentator, comedian Francis Agoda, aka I Go Dye is supporting President Muhammadu Buhari’s fight against corruption. In an open letter to the President, the comedian who expressed his support, albeit subtly, highlighted the damages which corruption has done to the nation, while urging Nigerians to eschew the vice. He said: “As a people, most especially the youths, we should realise that national pride comes first, we should not wait to be reminded before we use our greatness to rebuild this nation. The time has come for us to ask what has been happening to our collective wealth; who, how and what have been done with the money. This issue is beyond religious beliefs; it is the major problem against our spiritual lives in this country today. We have to speak and build our national pride, we must take patriotism as a virtue that must come first, it so important, without it no nation can be built. Regardless of what we enjoy today as elites and successful people, our prosperity cannot be easily transferred to all our children, let’s work to build a country devoid of corruption, a place where children, youths and our mothers will not wallow in pain of starvation and poverty.” Making reference to this year’s Democracy Day, I Go Dye categorically opined that there’s nothing to celebrate about democracy in the face of corruption. “Corruption is killing our mothers and young children on a daily basis, because the funds meant for healthcare and proper management of our hospitals have often been diverted by someone in authority,” he added, pointing out that today, “We still have the highest mortality rate because of corruption. It’s beyond religious and ethnic boundaries; it’s an epidemic that lives with us like our shadows.”
