Operatives of the Inspector- Generalof Police’ (IG) Intelligence Response Team (IRT) yesterday evening arrested two suspected kidnappers in Lagos The suspects were said to belong to a gang terrorising Ikotun and environs. It was gathered that the operatives had been on the trail of the gang, whose members usually wore police or military uniforms and drove Sport Utility Vehicles (SUVs) with shielded number plates. A source told our correspondent that the suspects were trailed from NNPC Bus Stop in Ejigbo to Shasha, where they were picked up. He said: “The gang has been giving us serious problems. They usually covered their number plates as though it is a VIP that was in the vehicle so that they would not be stopped by security operatives. “We have been trailing them for some time and yesterday evening, we got information that they were somewhere around NNPC. “Our men moved to the area and we identified a Lexus Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) they were in. They followed the SUV from a comfortable distance but the suspects noticed they were being followed and they started speeding. “Fortunately, their vehicle fell inside a ditch at Shasha and our men got them. We searched their vehicle and recovered assorted charms and other items concealed in a carton. They were taken to the police station at Shasha but would be moved to the command because they are dangerous criminals.” Spokesman for the command, Chike Oti, a Superintendent (SP) could not be reached for comments at the time of filing this report.
