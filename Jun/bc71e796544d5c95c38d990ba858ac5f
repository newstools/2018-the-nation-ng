A governorship aspirant in Osun State, Dr. Akin Ogunbiyi, says economic prosperity will be the lot of the people if he is given the opportunity to rule. Ogunbiyi, who is a former managing director of Mutual Benefit Assurance, wants to contest on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Addressing supporters when he visited to the partyâ€™s secretariat in Osogbo to declare his intention to contest, Ogunbiyi said leadership is about service. He urged his fellow aspirants to allow the corporate interest of PDP predominate over personal ambition, adding that if he wins the ticket he would return Osun State to the path of economic prosperity without plunging the state into unnecessary debts. He donated a 60-seater bus to the state party secretariat and also announced the donation of 46 brand new vehicles to the party. Besides, he awarded scholarship to the son of former image maker of the PDP, Iyabo Olusola, who died recently following a protracted illness. Responding, the PDP chairman, Soji Adagunodo, noted that Ogunbiyi had been a consistent financier of the party. He recalled that he was deeply involved in the reconciliation process that saved the PDP from being torn into shreds during the intra party crises which lasted for two years.
