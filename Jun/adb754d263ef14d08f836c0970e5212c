A group, Buhari/Osinbajo Continuity Group (BOCOG) has lauded the conduct of the last week Saturday convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abuja. It hailed President Muhammadu Buhari, immediate past National Chairman of the party, Chief John Odigie Oyegun and the national leader of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Other leaders of the party, including the National Convention Committee chairman,the Jigawa State Governor Abubakar Badaru and his Deputy, the Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu were also appreciated for their effort towardst the successful convention. In a statement by its Director of Communications Steve Bayode, the group described the emergence of Adam Oshiomhole as a round peg in a round hole. According to the group, “Our leaders, President Muhammadu Buhari, his deputy, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Chief John Odigie -Oyegun and others shocked the enemies of our party by the peaceful conduct of the national convention last Saturday and the acceptable outcome. “The opposition was expecting the convention to cause irreparable implosion just like their experience in 2014 and ever since have not been able to put their house in order. “We believe that the need of the convention is aimed at fortifying the stronghold of our party across the nation. “We in BOCOG believed that all stakeholders saw this purposeful drive and ensured peaceful conduct and acceptance of the outcome. “We, however, urged our new National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole to hit the ground running by embracing everyone and work assiduously to bring more people on board our party towards 2019. “We in BOCOG also suggest that Comrade Oshiomhole should move round the 36 states of the Federation to collate whatever challenges the party is facing in their respective states and work on how to surmount them with a view to strengthening our party to the grassroots.”
