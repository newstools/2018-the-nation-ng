FT: Brazil eliminate Serbia and secure their place in the second round of the World Cup after a comfortable 2-0 victory in Moscow. Paulinho’s lob settled the nerves on 36 minutes and Thiago Silva’s second-half header (68) confirmed their passage as Group E winners, while ensuring Brazil didn’t become the second World Cup heavyweight to crash out on Wednesday following Germany’s shock exit earlier in the day. The victory means Tite’s side will play Mexico in Samara on Monday afternoon and could then potentially face the winner of England’s group in a quarter-final. SERBIA TEAM NEWS Team to play Brazil: Stoikovic, Rukavina, Milenkovic, Veljkovic, Kolarov, Milinkovic-Savic, Matic, Tadic, Ljajic, Kostic, Mitrovic BRAZIL TEAM NEWS Team to play Serbia: Alisson, Fagner, Thiago Silva, Miranda, Marcelo, Casemiro, Paulinho, Coutinho, Willian, Jesus, Neymar,  THREE CHANGES FOR SERBIA Branislav Ivanovic, Dusko Tosic and Luka Milivojevic have all been left out of the team that lost to Switzerland last Friday with Antonio Rukavina, Milos Veljkovic and Adem Ljajic coming in to replace them. Six of the Serbia squad have been booked and three of those players walking the disciplinary tightrope start this game; Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, Aleksandar Mitrovic and Nemanja Matic. Brazil coach Tite has stuck with the same side that left it late to beat Costa Rica last Friday. Danilo is out with a thigh problem and Douglas Costa has a hamstring injury, while Roberto Firmino still can’t get a start for his country at this World Cup.
