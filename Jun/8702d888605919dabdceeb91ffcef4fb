•38 victims rescued The Katsina Command of the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) has arrested four suspected human traffickers and rescued 38 victims. The command also paraded nine suspected victims and pledged to hand them over to its headquarters in Abuja for further investigation. Addressing reporters in Katsina, the State Comptroller of Immigration Ajisafe Joshua Olusola said the suspects are between 21 and 43 years. The NIS chief added that most of them hailed from different states. He said: “The three suspected victims are from Ogun State, one each from Abia, Oyo, Imo, Edo, Osun and Enugu states. The victims were individually recruited by different agents from Lagos and Port Harcourt. “They started their journey from Lagos with the intention of travelling to Niger Republic to obtain biometric capture for United States of American visa at the American Embassy in Niamey, the Niger Republic capital, under one agent named Balogun Taiwo, who is residing in Niamey.” Reiterating the command’s readiness to stop human trafficking and child labour in the state, Olusola urged the public to provide NIS with vital information about human trafficking and child labour in the state. He said such information, if provided, will go a long way in assisting the NIS in fighting and preventing child trafficking and other related cases across the country.
