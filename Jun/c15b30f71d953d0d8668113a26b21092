The Nigerian Senate today will be holding the Public Hearing on the following Bills: Petroleum Industry Fiscal Framework Bill; Petroleum Host Community Bill; and Petroleum Industry Administration Bill. This was made known by the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki via his twitter handle in the early hours of today.  The Petroleum Industry Bill ( PIB ) seeks to provide solutions to several issues militating against the oil and gas sector in Nigeria. The PIB, as a single, all embracing, and comprehensive document, will change the whole gamut of the petroleum industry in Nigeria. It will encourage more investment as well as achieve improved regulation, transparency and accountability in Nigeriaâ€™s oil and gas industry.
