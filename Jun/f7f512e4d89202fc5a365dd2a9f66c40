Following a petition being passed by Juryman Associate Chambers, on behalf of Higher Group Nig. Ltd, with claims that popular comedian Ayo Makun, known as AY owes the sum of N47m, the manager of the comedian, Amadi, has rebuffed it. In a phone chat with The Nation, he said that the comedian has no direct dealing with the owner of the property, and therefore should not a called out as the debtor. “AY is just a part of the Board of Directors,” said Amadi. “He is the lowest, there are others that are higher in position and there is also the head of the board, which all issues concerning the property should be directed to. “The reason AY’s name is being mentioned is because he is popular. That building is used as a company, it is not owned by an individual. When the place was rented it was in shambles, but the company fixed it up to what they wanted to use it for, which was a club. “And when they were ready to vacate the place, they took everything that was theirs. There was also a case of elevator, which was promised by the owner of the building when the club started running, which he promised to fix, but did not,” Amadi added. According to the petition dated April 24, 2018, which has been sent to the Area Commander, Area J Police Command, Ajah, Lagos, the tenancy of the building occupied by Ayo Makun (AY) is over and AY is expected to have evacated the building and paid the outstanding sum of N47m. A breakdown of the N47m includes, rent arrears of N40m, accumulated electricity bill of N1.2m and service charge of N2.5m.
