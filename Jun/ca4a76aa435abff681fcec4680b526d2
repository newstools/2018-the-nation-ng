Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Ondo State said on Saturday it rescued three children abandoned at different locations in the state. The Corps Commandant, Pedro Awili, disclosed this in Akure, the state capital. He said the NSCDC officers rescued the children at two different locations in Akure on May 29, adding that the children are between the ages of one and four years. The commandant said the NSCDC personnel rescued the one-year old child at a road opposite the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) Secretariat in Oda road, Akure. Awili said: “On May 29, at about 6:00 a.m., a young baby-girl of less than one year was abandoned opposite NYSC secretariat, Oda road, Akure. “This baby was in critical health condition and it was suspected that she was abandoned by her parent, who covered her with a small towel and kept her by the road side. “It rained heavily on that morning and the baby almost gave up until NSCDC officials rescued her. “In conjunction with the Ministry of Women Affairs, Ondo State, and from its Traffic Unit, we took the child to an intensive care. “Presently, as I speak, the baby is receiving treatment at police clinic in Akure and doctors are helping us to ensure that the baby survives.” NAN
