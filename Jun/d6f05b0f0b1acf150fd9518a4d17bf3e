Kola Daisi University, Ibadan, has announced a N50,000 reduction in fees across all its undergraduate programmes. The University’s Vice-Chancellor, Prof Kolade Ayorinde, said in a statement that the special subsidy package was in line with the university’s founder, Chief Kola Daisi’s vision to make education affordable. Ayorinde said the subsidy “will be solely funded by the University’s Founder, Chief Kola Daisi and we thus owe him a lot of gratitude for his untiring interventions in education and youth empowerment initiatives”. The Vice-Chancellor added that, “The subsidy scheme is scheduled to take effect from the 2018/2019 academic session. It will not only be enjoyed by our fresh students, the largesse will also accommodate the returning students”. In addition to the subsidy, the Vice-Chancellor further disclosed that the University Management will equally offer 2.5% discount to the first hundred students to complete their registration, while students who pay their fees once, will enjoy an extra 5% discount. Pro-Chancellor and Chairman, Governing Council of the University, Prof Adeniyi Osuntogun, applauded Daisi, who is also the Bashorun of Ibadan land considering the current economic reality in the country, along with its attendant consequences on educational attainment and quality manpower.
