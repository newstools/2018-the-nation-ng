Findings revealed that some senior officers of the command had to put their lives on the line to seize the items, most especially the 15 trailers. A senior official of the unit, who craved anonymity, said: “It was a big battle at the creek and bush parts to seize the rice from smugglers. The resilience and doggedness of the officers are highly commendable.”
