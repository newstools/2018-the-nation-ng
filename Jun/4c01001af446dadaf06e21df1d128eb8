The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the European Union (EU) have evacuated 186 more Nigerians from Libya. The spokesperson for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), South-West Zone, Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, disclosed this on Friday in Lagos. Farinloye said the returnees arrived in two batches at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, on Wednesday and Thursday. He said,” Within 24 hours, NEMA has received 186 Nigerian returnees from Libya on two different flights at the MMIA, Lagos. “The flight with 154 returnees arrived the airport at 8:45p.m. on Thursday aboard a chartered Libya Airline with registration number 5A-DMG. They were received at the Cargo Wing of the airport. “The other 32 returnees arrived via a commercial flight, which landed at the International wing of the airport on Wednesday at 3:45a.m.” According to him, the returnees comprised of 99 female adults, 75 male adults, four children and eight infants. Farinloye said the new arrivals were those based in Libya but voluntarily decided to return home when opportunity came from IOM because of the current volatile state of the North African country. He disclosed that IOM had started training past returnees in batches in order to reintegrate them into the society.
