The United States Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, said on Thursday North Korea would not see any economic sanctions lifted until it has demonstrated “complete denuclearization.” Mr. Pompeo was speaking at a press conference in Seoul with his South Korean and Japanese counterparts, the BBC reports. It comes days after U.S President Donald Trump and North Korea leader, Kim Jong-un held a historic summit in Singapore. The leaders signed a statement pledging to establish a new relationship. Mr. Kim also reaffirmed its previous promises to work towards the “complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula.” But there has been deep skepticism about the agreement, with observers saying it lacked detail on how North Korea would give up its nuclear weapons and how that process would be verified. Mr. Pompeo travelled from Singapore to South Korea to brief the U.S’s regional allies on the summit, and on Mr. Trump’s surprise announcement that he was ending routine U.S-South Korea military drills. He said the summit had marked a “turning point” in the relationship between the U.S and North Korea. Mr Pompeo dismissed a report by North Korean state media that indicated the U.S would grant concessions to Pyongyang for gradual progress. He said the U.S remained “committed to achieving the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of North Korea.”
