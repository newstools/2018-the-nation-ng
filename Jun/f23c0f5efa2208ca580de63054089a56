•Govt launches ‘kick against drug abuse campaign’ Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode yesterday said his administration will not allow the practice of drug abuse damage the future of the youths. The Governor said this at the flag off of the State Kicks Against Drug Abuse (LASKADA) at the LTV Blue-Roof, Ikeja. Represented by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Mr. Tunji Bello, Ambode added that the increasing menace of drug abuse and its impact on the society in recent times is really on the high side. The present administration, he said, is committed to a more prosperous Lagos. He said the decision to commence the massive awareness was a response to the dangerous dimension that drug abuse has taken. He added that the establishment of youth-friendly centres in all the Local Government Areas/Local Government Development Areas is meant to serve as avenues for relaxation and to further engage the youths in productive ventures to reduce the menace of drug abuse. The Drug Dependent Rehabilitation Centres located in Isheri and Majidun, he said, were established to give support to young ones addicted to drugs. Ambode’s wife, Bolanle said the society cannot pretend that all is well, considering the unwholesome attitude of many youths who are drug addicts.
