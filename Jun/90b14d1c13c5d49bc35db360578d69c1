A hotel in Surulere, Lagos Mainland, has been caught using light without its consumption reflecting in the meter. The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) Plc yesterday said Samwolly Guest House on Idita Street, Surulere, was caught engaging in the practice known as meter bypass during an inspection of electricity consumers. Its General Manager, Corporate Communications, Godwin Idemudia told reporters that the hotel owner tried to prevent EKEDC officials from entering when they first went there. Idemudia said the action triggered suspicion that something unwholesome might be happening in the hotel. This, he said, led to the decision to make another surprise visit to the place. According to him, it was during the second visit that the officials established that the three meters in the hotel have been bypassed. Idemudia decried a situation where corporate bodies and business concerns could engage alleged meter bypass and energy theft. He said after being caught, the hotel owner resorted to blackmail and subversion to incite the public against the company. Idemudia said the hotelâ€™s complaint against estimated billings led to the installation of three pre-paid meters in the place. He said it was unfortunate that a customer which got prompt response to its complaint could turn around to short-change the company. EKEDC, he said, would not succumb to intimidation or blackmail to ensure that perpetrators of energy theft and meter bypass were brought to book.
