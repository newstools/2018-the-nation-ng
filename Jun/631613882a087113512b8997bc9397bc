 If there is one place to avoid blinking now, it is the Sheremetyevo International Airport and indeed the major airports into Russia.  When four years ago after the last World cup in Brazil it was highlighted that the next point of call will be Russia, it looked more like ages away.  But here we are counting in days and very soon in hours that will snowball into minutes and seconds. All the entry points have become beehive of activities as the 736 players representing 32 countries and their supporters converge on Russia to again fulfill a once in four years ritual that often leaves some in cheers and some others in tears. Offering many opportunity to sing victory song while giving others opportunity to sing lamentation songs. One unique thing about the participating teams is that they grace official sent forth, garnished with prayer and best of wishes.  The Language may be different but the message remains go in Peace, go prove yourself, and go bring us the cup. Don’t bother to blink, the favorites and the underdogs are touching down in droves. The Super Eagles will join the party on Sunday and will play their first match on June 16 against Croatia at the Kaliningrad stadium. A 35,212 capacity stadium, considered unique, not in terms of design but that  it  is the only stadium based outside of mainland Russia. In a city annexed between Poland and Lithuania, Kaliningrad is where England will round off Group G against Belgium. Croatia v Nigeria Group D, 16 June Serbia v Switzerland Group E, 22 June Spain v Morocco Group B, 25 June England v Belgium Group G, 28 June
