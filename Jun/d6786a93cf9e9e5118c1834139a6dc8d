Super Eagles Star, John Ogu has drawn the ire of his in-laws after he posted a message on his Twitter handle to celebrate his daughter Ivanna who turned one on Saturday. The player who should hit Russia on Monday with his national teammates for the FIFA World Cup has been separated from his wife Vera after two years of marriage. But the love was not welcomed by Vera’s sister, Mimi who took to Twitter to vent her anger. Mimi  @iam_meemee-  could not hold back her emotions as she blasted the Israeli based midfielder for claiming to love his daughter. “But Daddy was in Nigeria 2 weeks ago and didn’t see his daughter! Oh I forgot Daddy hasn’t seen his daughter since he kicked her and her mom out from Isreal LAST YEAR. You can do everything John but what you won’t do is pretend like you’re Ivanna’s life for the gram,” tweeted Mimi The current development implies that Ogu will have the heart of a lion to remain focused in Russia as he serves his father land inspite of his marital issues. The couple welcomed their daughter few months after their widely publicised wedding that was attended by the creme de la creme of the society.
