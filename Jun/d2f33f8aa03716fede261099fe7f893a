The fire destroyed goods and property estimated at millions of naira last week in the shops near the palace of the Deji of Akure, Oba Aladetoyinbo Aladelusi. Akeredolu, who called for calm, assured the traders of assistance after a verification of the damage. He said: “We will cart away the debris and start the verification. We will also source for funds to assist the traders.” The governor also assured them that his administration would tackle the challenges facing the state fire service to enable it respond promptly to incidents. Oba Aladelusi urged the traders to be patient and place their trust in God. The monarch assured them that the government was committed to offering assistance to those affected. He also said the court building near the palace would be made available for temporary use of the traders. A spokesman for the traders, Mr Bakare Olabisi, said the fire rendered over 300 traders jobless. He pleaded with the state government to assist the victims and provide another location to enable them to continue their businesses.
