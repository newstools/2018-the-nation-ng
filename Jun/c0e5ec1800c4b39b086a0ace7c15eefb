Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has revealed that the mandatory fight between Anthony Joshua and the dangerous Alexander Povetkin has been fixed. “We’re fighting Povetkin in September and we’re looking at multiple venues and dates,” Hearn said Wednesday night. “We have a deal with Povetkin agreed to, but it’s not signed yet,” he added. Hearn further revealed that the fight will take place September 22 or 29, at one of London’s major stadiums, Wembley, Twickenham or London Olympic Stadium. Povektin has won 8 straight fights since his lone defeat to Wladimir Klitschko in 2013, but has had some recent problems testing positive for performance enhancing drugs. Talking about the impending match-up between Joshua and Povektin, Hearn describes it as: “Massive danger. I don’t like the fight,” Hearn said. “I think it’s a mad fight to take with the Wilder fight at the door, but that’s AJ. He thinks him and Povetkin is a great fight, a great statement and he’s one of the best heavyweights. He’s not taking easy touches waiting for Wilder. By fighting these guys, Wilder can’t say he’s afraid to fight him.” Hearn maintains that if Wilder really still wants to fight Joshua then they can target an April 2019 fight in the U.K.
