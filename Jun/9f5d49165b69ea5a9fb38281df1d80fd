…Abductors deleted pictures from boyfriends phone  Two siblings who were stolen last week at Utese village in Ovia North East local government area by two women are yet to be seen. A search party that combed the bush and forest of Utese and environs returned home without the children. The search party had stormed the bush following a revelation from an herbalist that the children were inside the bush with their abductors. It would be recalled that the two children identified as Amanda and Christabel were taken to an unknown destination by the two women identified as Rose and Mercy. The two women had spent only three weeks as tenants in the victims’ house when the incident happened. Mother of the victims, Faith, had left her children in the custody of the tenants when she was going to the stream to fetch water and all efforts to locate the whereabouts of her children have failed. Sources at the village told our reporter that the two suspects deleted their pictures from the phones of their boyfriends before carrying out the abduction. The family has visited several motor-parks in the locality with photographs of the children but drivers told them they have not seen them. Father of the stolen girls, Omokpia Osaruoname, said he has done everything to know the whereabouts of his daughters but no avail. He said, “We are working hard to retrieve my children. They deleted the pictures in their boyfriend phones. The boys said they were not aware that the pictures were deleted. “I am no longer sound. My wife is in shock. Two out my three daughters are missing. The problem is that I don’t know where these girls come from. I helped them by giving them accommodation but I didn’t know they have a mission to take my children.”
