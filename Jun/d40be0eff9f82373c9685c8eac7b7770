The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said at least 2.5 million migrants were smuggled during the course of 2016. UNODC, in the first ever Global Study on Smuggling of Migrants, said migrant smuggling occurred in all parts of the world, generated an income of up to $7billion. The UN agency that fights drugs and crime, said the amount was equivalent to what the United States or the European Union spent on humanitarian aid in 2016. “This transnational crime preys on the most vulnerable of the vulnerable,” said Jean-Luc Lemahieu, UNODC Director of Policy Analysis and Public Affairs. “It’s a global crime that requires global action, including improved regional and international cooperation and national criminal justice responses.” The study described 30 major smuggling routes worldwide and found that demand for smuggling services was particularly high among refugees who, for lack of other means, might need to use people-smugglers to reach a safe destination fleeing their countries of origin.
