The leadership of the Labour Party has expressed delight at the return of former Governor of Ondo State, Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, to the party. The National Chairman of the LP, Alhaji Abdulkadir Abdulsalam, who was excited by the turn of event, said the return of the former governor and his supporters would add more value to the party. Abdulsalam, in a statement issued on Thursday also, urged the public, especially party members and supporters to discountenance remarks credited to one Mike Omotosho, saying Mimiko was not welcome back to the party. The statement reads:  “The Labour Party wishes to dismiss in its entirety a statement credited to one Mike Omotosho purporting to reject the return to the Labour Party of Dr. Olusegun Mimiko, the immediate past Governor of Ondo State and his teeming supporters. “We state that the position expressed by this individual does not reflect the position of the executive and members of the party across the country. “The Labour Party is elated that a social democrat like Dr. Mimiko, who through his sterling performances as governor mainstreamed pro-people and pro-poor policies, programmes and projects, is returning to add value to the party. “Contrary to the views expressed via the said statement, we state that the Labour Party is open to all Nigerians who subscribe to her goals, programmes and social democratic ideology, and does not owe her existence to any single individual outside the provisions of its constitution.”
