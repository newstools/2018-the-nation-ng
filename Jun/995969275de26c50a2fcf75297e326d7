For the economy to get stronger, the Federal Government has urged the National Employment Council to fashion  more sustainable ways of creating more jobs. It affirmed that Nigeria can no longer depend on proceeds from crude oil as the mainstay of the economy, but rather as a catalyst for other employment-generating sectors. Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, who addressed the council’s meeting in Abuja, said though Nigeria is out of recession, it must not go back to depending on crude oil. ”I am asking members of the National Employment Council to put on their thinking caps so that they can fashion out ways of job creation to give us something new,” he said. The minister emphasised that the job creation efforts of the Federal Government, such as the N-Power and Anchor Borrowers Programme, have yielded the much-anticipated results and taken many youths out of unemployment. The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Job Creation/Youth Employment, Mr. Afolabi Imoukuhede, also said the job creation efforts of the President have yielded positive results. “The results are out there for all to see and experience; the impacts are out there and the lives that have been touched are speaking out continuously. “We will keep improving; it is part of the responsibilities of the employment council to see to it that all employment creation initiatives of the present administration are institutionalised and sustained,” Afolabi said.
