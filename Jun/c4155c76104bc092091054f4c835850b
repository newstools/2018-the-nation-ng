AHEAD of September 22 governorship election in Osun State, three civil society groups have embarked on a public assessment project in Osun State. The project targets about 30,000 respondents on governance in the state for the past eight years. The groups said it was aimed at establishing deep public perception of the socio-political developments in the state for the past eight years. The project is being undertaken by three rights groups, the Civil Society Coalition for Mandate Protection, (CSC-MAP), the Nigerian Human Rights Community (NHRC), and the Green Peoples Environmental Rights Groups (GREPNET), a member of the International Alliance on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples of the Tropical Forest (IAITPTF), based in Thailand. In a release, which was signed by Comrade Oluwole Suleiman, Uche Obiora and Oladimeji Fatunla, the group stated that 10,000 questionnaires have been distributed to 500 volunteers picked across the 31 local government areas. Is said there is also an online version expected to reach a total of 20,000 people using Information Technology (IT). The project takes a look at cultural, socio-political and economic developments in the state from the perspectives of the people. The statement said: “We are adopting best practices in measuring good governance in Nigeria. Osun has been picked as a pilot project in Nigeria. We want the people to assess the government in the past eight years in a reflective and comparative sense. Every social strata in Osun will participate in the questionnaire including civil servants, students, peasants and the general public.” The groups stated that 10,000 questionnaires will be administered while the same assessment is being conducted online and that it is targeting a minimum of 20,000 people. The statement said the coalition is organizing training for some of the key leaders of the survey in the three senatorial districts of the state. The trainees will be responsible for administering the questionnaire to locals.
