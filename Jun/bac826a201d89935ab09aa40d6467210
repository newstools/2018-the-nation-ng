Media personality, Adenrele Olufemi Adeyemi, better known as Denrele, who clocked 37 on June 13, celebrated the day reviving his hidden talent as an artist. Posting series of pictures on his Instagram, the co-host of ‘The Boot’ had his body displaying series of yellow painted buses showcasing his own story of what Lagos State is. “The four things that come to mind when people think of LAGOS are: Population, Problems, Poverty and Promises Unfulfilled. But that’s not the whole story! My Lagos (as artfully painted on me) shows you something different. We hustle, we find ways to overcome, and we survive. “There is only one of me and I stand vehemently to lend my voice through my art and the pragmatic use of my craft to consciously and radically inspire generations, both behind and before me. Come with me into the indescribable world of my potentiality. I am in the most rewarding era of my career yet, and I am very cognizant of the universe’s role in moulding and manifesting through and in me; I-am-not-your-regular-tom greatness”. On his journey so far as an entertainer in showbiz business, he said; “I am glad and privileged to be a vessel unto honour – bear in mind that you mightn’t want to be in my shoes – what I have survived can devour you and your future to come. Still I welcome you all into my realm where I artfully educate you on the journey which I began decades ago. I let my art succinctly speak to your ever curious minds seeking validation”. The picture as revealed by the entertainer took seven hours to complete the painting. Denrele also revealed that for the first time, he will be giving out various gifts to 37 persons including writers, up and coming artistes, students, single moms, budding entrerepeurs, die-hard fans and random selections.
