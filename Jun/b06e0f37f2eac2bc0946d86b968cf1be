 You may wonder what Senegal and Japan have in common.  Both are campaigning at the ongoing world cup in Russia and both have won their opening matches. Japan won 2-1 against Colombia and Senegal won 2-1 against Poland, but that is not all. Recall that at the last world cup in 2014 in Brazil, Japan lost 2-1 to Ivory Coast at the Arena Pernambuco in Recife. But rather than being downcast by the loss, to Didier Drogba and co, the Japanese fans armed with Liners patrolled their side of the stadium and gathered up discarded litter. An open announcement to those who probably don’t understand that football though a competition in which a winner must emerge is also an entertainment that should be enjoyed with animosity While gathering waste after a sporting event is customary in Japan, the spectators’ actions came as a shock to football fans from other countries. You could say they had a stake after all the co-hosted the championship with Korea, but African representatives Senegal who only Tuesday showed class by being the first African country competing in Russia to win a match re-enacted what Japanese fans did four years ago by cleaning up the stadium 40 minutes after their match against Poland. The West Africans, who received a lot of accolades on social media following their performance on the pitch, have added more accolades with their cleanup effort. The on and off the pitch action of the Senegalese have turned them into the darling of many soccer fans now praying for them to do well in Russia just like they did in Korea/Japan. Interestingly both teams will lock horns on June 24th where the Taranga Lions will be hoping to take control of Group H should they earn another victory against Japan. Senegal are appearing in the world cup for the second time their first being in 2002 where the made it all the way to the Quarterfinals announcing their arrival with a 1-0 defeat of France in the opening match.
