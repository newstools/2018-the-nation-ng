A governorship aspirant in Ogun State, Babasola Adegbuyi, has advised the electorate to de-emphasize zoning and pay more attention to the critical issues of aspirants’ competence, sincerity and pedigree, when deciding who should govern the state in 2019. He said too much emphasis on zoning will further divide the people along ethnic line. He spoke while fielding questions from reporters in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital,  shortly after meeting with the state executive of the Young Peoples Party(YPP). The youthful aspirant who hails from Ogun East zone of the state, said zoning had brought no real gains to the state except mediocrity in governance and sectionalism instead of equitable developments. He urged youths of the state to key into the “Not too young to run” bill that was signed into law and rally round his aspiration to become the next governor in 2019, saying he would take governance to the next level in the state. He pledged to make education, youth empowerment, infrastructural development, agriculture, security and industrial development the focal points of his administration if given the mandate to lead in 2019. According to him, the abandoned Olokola Liquified Natural Gas (OKLNG) and  Olokola Free Trade Zone (OKFTZ) would be revisited and re – activated to drive massive youth employment, revenue generation and socioeconomic development in the state.
