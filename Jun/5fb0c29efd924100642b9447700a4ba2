Beginning from tomorrow, emotional intelligence experts in the country will hold a five day free intensive training session for Nigerians in Lagos to mark this year’s emotional intelligence week. Speaking with The Nation, Oyinkansola Alabi said the event will be the first ever in Africa. She explained that the first day is dedicated to youth while the second day is for professionals. There are also days for school owners, teachers and everyone who has the custody of a child whether teenagers or little children. “I love to see young adults  take responsibility for their existence. I love to see professionals understand that emotions drive people and people drive professionals. I love to see teachers who train because they want to see their students become very successful. I love to see religious leaders lead from a place of passion and drive, not from a place of money and I love to see parents and couples emotionally raise and train their children. “At the end of the training, we hope to raise emotional intelligent entities in Nigeria and we think we can change Nigerians, one mind at a time. Over one thousand people have registered for the training and we hope they will all turn up,” she said.
