He said:“the command wishes to inform the general public that again, on the June 21, 2018, at about 10:00 hours, the violent members of the proscribed IMN popularly refer to as Shiite, armed with guns, knives and Improvised Explosive Devises (IEDs) violently attacked every police officer on sight, during which they brutally killed a police officer and injured several others.” He described the action as confrontational and a calculated attempt to force the police into conflict with the group to disrupt the peace in the state. “In the cause of containing the incident, a number of suspects were arrested and will soon be charged to court. “The police will not leave any stone unturned in making sure that those who are bent on perpetrating evil through violence are brought to book. “Members of the public are enjoined to work with the police and other security agencies by providing timely information on any emerging threat to our collective peaceful existence. “They are also to caution their relations and wards to desist from supporting or joining the violent group as the command has resolved to apply the full weight of the law in dealing with persons disturbing the peace in the state.”
