Tennis Super Star Rafael Nadal has again proved his mantle as the King of Clay. It was clay-court tennis as usual at Roland Garros on Sunday, as the Spaniard won his 11th French Open singles title. Nadal, 32, has won six major titles on grass and hardcourts, but clay is his natural element, like water for Michael Phelps or snow for Marcel Hirscher. “I think today I played my best match of the tournament,” Nadal said. “It was very important. Dominic is an opponent who is very aggressive, very difficult to play, with big shots.” Thiem’s best results also have come on clay. He lost in the semifinals in the last two years and has been the second best clay-court player in the world during that time. But he could not match Nadal’s point-by-point consistency and intensity on Sunday. Nadal’s 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory at age 32 was a tribute to his enduring excellence and drive, and to his continuing ability to bounce back. Nadal has never lost a best-of-five match on clay after winning the first set, and Thiem was unable to change that equation.
