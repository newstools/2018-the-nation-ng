Reacting to his sudden demise, Member of the Board of Trustees of Association of Nollywood Core Producers (ANCOP), Chris Ekejimbe, told members of a WhatsApp group on Saturday afternoon that Bambino’s wife confirmed the death to him. “Just spoke with his wife. He is dead,” Ekejimbe wrote. Other friends and colleagues of the filmmaker have expressed shock on Anachina’s Facebook page. “Pity about Bambino.. His first movie was a piece I directed in the late 90’s.  ‘ Saved ‘.He played the Devil .His butt caught fire during shoot,” Madu Chikwendu wrote. “Yesterday, Bambino had plans, ironically, he had survived frightening situations when hope was lost .. one of then was in LUTH before me… and another was on a 4SCREAMS SET… “How come, when he looked strong and victorious he was taken away suddenly…. He was a friend, he has worked with me for years…But yesterday,he had plans…he was not expecting death at all..then this morning …it happened,” said a distraught Chris Ekejimbe. A product of Federal Polytechnic in Oko, Anambra State, Bambino Anachina counted musician, actor and politician, Tony One Week, as the biggest influence on his career.
