Kissing the Russia 2018 World Cup is like swallowing a bitter pill for recuperating Super Eagles’ goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme. The 31-year-old Wolves goalkeeper was diagnosed with acute leukaemia last summer ahead of the Championship club’s promotion-winning campaign and missed the entire season to receive treatment. Before the diagnosis in the UK, the shot-stopper had emerged the Super Eagles’ No 1 after making his international debut against the Taifa Stars of Tanzania on September 5, 2015, in a 2017 Africa Cup of Nations qualification game in Dar es Salaam. Ikeme who made three appearances early on in Nigeria’s successful qualification campaign for the 2018 FIFA World Cup could not hide his emotion as he described not playing in the World Cup as devastating. “To say I’m devastated about missing the World Cup is an understatement.” Ikeme, who will be 32 on June 8 posted on his official twitter handle yesterday. “But I just want to thank everyone in Nigeria for there prayers,love and messages. I can’t explain how much they mean to me?? I also want to wish my teammates, coaches and NFF luck for the summer coming” SportingLife also gathered that the @Carl Ikeme flag will be displayed one minute before the players walk out at Wembley today while 2/3 blocks of Wolves fans will be in sections 108-114 for the England friendly against Nigeria. Last Tuesday, Coach Gernot Rohr named Ikeme an honorary member of the Super Eagles’ squad for the World Cup in Russia. Rohr said: “Until the last moment, there is a possibility of bringing in these players. Carl Ikeme will be our 24th player to the World Cup.” Ikeme has made 10 caps for Nigeria and was Man of the Match in Eagles opening qualifier against Zambia in Ndola in October 2016.
