President Muhammadu Buhari has said that the death of Sarkin Fadan Kano, Alhaji Sule Gaya, has robbed the country of one its humblest and dedicated parliamentarians. Reacting to the demise of Gaya who was buried on Friday, the President said one of the greatest legacies a man or woman can leave behind is their unblemished integrity, adding that the late Sarkin Fada of Kano was a remarkable man in his own right. President Buhari, who described the late Sarkin Fadan Kano as a pride to his family and State, said Gaya did not only live to the ripe age of 107 years but also lived an exemplary life of integrity and dedicated public service record. As a member of the defunct Northern House of Assembly and a regional Minister of Local Government in the Second Republic, the President noted that the late Sule Gaya belonged to the golden age of decent and respectable democratic representation. President Buhari, in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, believed that the best tribute the children of the deceased could pay to the centenarian is to live by his examples of humility, honesty and dedication to public service. The President, while extending his condolences to the family, the Kano Emirate, the government and the people of Kano State, prayed to Allah to bless and forgive the gentle soul of the deceased.
