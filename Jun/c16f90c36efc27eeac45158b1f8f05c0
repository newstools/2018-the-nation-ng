A family brand noted for Maltina Dance All reality show, the brand has continued its mission of nourishing precious family moments, one of which the Children’s Day celebration provides. “Being able to hang out with my kids away from the stress of work and all that is such a fantastic experience. I can’t remember the last time we did this as a family and I’m so glad I didn’t pass on this opportunity. This was indeed a wonderful experience and I can’t thank Maltina enough,” says an excited guest, Yemisi Adekola. It was an interesting moment as the families got to enjoy fun activities like face-painting, sack races, carousel rides, Tug of War, board games, puzzles, foosball, and lots of other exciting side attractions.

Winners of some of these games got to walk away with amazing gifts like a laptop, giant teddy bear, Maltina goody bags, bicycles and other items.
