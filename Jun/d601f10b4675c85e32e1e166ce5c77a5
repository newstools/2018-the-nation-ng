Anthony Joshua is currently making the most of his break from boxing by trying out other adventurous sports. After enjoying a bike ride around the streets of London the other day, Joshua went one step further on Monday afternoon. Joshua, the unified WBA, WBO and IBF heavyweight titlist, tried out the sport Motocross, a form of motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. Joshua took to Instagram to post a photo of himself wearing protective gear while posing next to the motorbike, accompanied by the caption: ‘Balanced lifestyle #UKBikeLife’. While Joshua is out and about enjoying some quality time off, Eddie Hearn is busy trying to arrange the 28-year-old’s next heavyweight fight, with Alexander Povetkin in the pipeline. Hearn believes Povetkin would be the toughest opponent Joshua has faced, with the promoter branding the impending heavyweight showdown an ‘incredible risk’. Joshua is locked in discussions with WBC king Deontay Wilder over a money-spinning mega-fight to crown the first undisputed champion since Lennox Lewis. But AJ is likely to face Povetkin next, with a deal for him to meet his WBA mandatory challenger in September expected to be finalised soon. The Russian, who last fought on the undercard of Joshua’s win over Joseph Parker in March, has lost only once as a professional – to Wladimir Klitschko in 2013. ‘It’s an incredibly risky fight – it might be a little bit of a mad fight to take before Wilder, but that’s Joshua,’ Hearn said on Thursday. ‘He doesn’t care. He wants a challenge; he doesn’t want easy fights.’
