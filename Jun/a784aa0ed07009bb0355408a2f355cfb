A former deputy national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),Chief Olabode George, yesterday asked President Muhammadu Buhari and former President Olusegun Obasanjo to  ceasefire in the ongoing standoff between  them. Obasanjo, in a statement on Friday, alleged plot by agents of the federal government to terminate his life on account of what he called his campaign for Buhari not to seek re-election. Information and Culture Minister, Lai Mohammed, in a swift response to the allegation, said government was not interested in killing Obasanjo or any Nigerian for that matter. However, George, in a reaction to the spat, said having read the statements from the two sides, he saw “nothing sinister in their motives.” He said: “As a military man, I know these senior officers very well. I have worked at close quarters with the two of them. I have no doubt about their selfless commitments to our nation. “I am appealing to the two personages as a junior officer to sheath their swords and resolve their differences behind the curtain. That is the military style. We don’t wash our dirty linens in the open. “Naturally, we can disagree, raise our voices, stamp our feet in disapproval, but never in the open. The essence of the esprit de corps is about mutual felicity and respect for each other. Pray, let’s keep it that way. Nigeria is greater than all of us. “For the purpose of clarity and historic objectivity, I write in non-partisan arbitration. The differences of my party with this administration are clear and obvious. We insist on the restructuring of the Nigerian Union to ensure democratic balance, equity, and the ingredients of fairness. On these solid points I remain committed.”
