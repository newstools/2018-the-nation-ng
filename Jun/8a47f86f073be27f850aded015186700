The President, Ota Diamond Lions Club, under the District 404B1 Lions Club International, Mr Ganiyu Olanrewaju Balogun, has appealed to members to increase their service to humanity to ensure a better society. Balogun, who spoke at the launching of the club’s Learning Resource Centre at Mokland Hotel in Ado-Odo/Ota Local Government Area of Ogun State, said the centre will enable members have access to reliable Lionism information. He reiterated that the place would bring members, intended members and the public together to get knowledge on Lionism. “The centre is still at the infant stage but we hope to make it the Mecca of Lions information for District 404B1 and a pride to behold,” he said. He urged members to continue to make people smile, saying that life is not qualified by fluency in English, branded clothes or rich lifestyle, but is measured by the number of faces who smile when they hear your name.
