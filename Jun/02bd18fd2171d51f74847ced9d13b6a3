Noodles brand, Indomie has presented a winning prize of a million naira to online artiste, David B-Online, winner of the ‘My Indomie My Remix’ Video competition. A cheque was presented to him along 28 other winners who won cash prizes of N500, 000, N200, 000 and N50, 000 at Indomie Head office in Lagos State. The promo, which started barely a month ago and was judged by Sound Sultan and Vector the Viper, required consumers to create their own original and creative version of the #MyIndomieMyStyle theme song while cleverly infusing one or more packs of any of the Indomie flavours. They had to then upload on social media with either the hashtag #MyIndomieMyRemix or #MyIndomieMyStyle and get followers to like, comment and share the video link. Speaking at the prize presentation ceremony at the company’s head office in Lagos, the Group Public Relations and Event Manager, Ashiwaju Temitope, said; “We are celebrating creativity and rewarding originality. As a brand we are constantly searching for creative ways of expression and more exciting ways to reach out to our consumers.” He also stated that the Indomie brand was committed to “putting its customers first, because Indomie consumers aren’t just ordinary consumers, but brand ambassadors, and they should be treated as such.”
