Senegal on Tuesday became the first African side to secure victory at the ongoing 2018 FIFA World Cup, in Russia after defeating Poland 2-1 at the Spartak Stadium in Moscow. Polish defender Thiago Cionek’s own goal and Mbaye Niang’s composed finish in the 61st minute put the 2002 World Cup quarter finalists in control of affairs until the East Europeans rallied and pulled a goal back through Grzegorz Krychowiak who headed in Kamil Grosicki’s cross in the 86th minute. But that came too late as the West Africans held on to secure the continent’s first three points in Russia. Poland created little, with striker Robert Lewandowski feeding on scraps and heavily marked by Senegal’s huge central defensive pairing of Salif Sane and Kalidou Koulibaly. But they ensured a frantic finale when Grzegorz Krychowiak headed home a free-kick at the far post. The result came hours after Japan had defeated 10-man Colombia 2-1 in Group H’s opening game
