Not less than 35 primary schools were reported to have been shut down in Obi Local Government Area of Nasarawa State as a result of attacks on  Tiv communities in the southern senatorial district of the state. The education secretary of Obi Local Government, Ogashuwa Onuku Samuel, made this known to journalists in his office in Obi,headquarters of Obi LGA. According to him: “Many primary schools are no longer existing in Obi council area following the displacement of the host communities. The effort by the state government to bring education to its citizens has fallen apart as the number of primary schools are reducing.” Samuel appealed that any finance that supposed to be used for the development of education activities in southern zone should be forwarded to the rehabilitation of the destroyed primary schools. According to him:”We are into Universal Basic Education Commission’s national personnel audit, but the host communities of these primary schools are not around hence it will affect the population”. “There is need for government to evolve another strategy to intervene in that case to resolve the differences between the two warring parties so that peace may permanently be restored to the communities affected by the crisis in other to bring educational activities back to its normal stage.” The education secretary gave names of the affected primary schools to include those at Gada Biyu, Nkusu, Mbagwa, Ngbahen, Gidan Onuku, Kuje, Kwaghshir, Usula, Akaha, Uvirkaa, Gidan Aondo, Igboughur, Kertyo, Chiawa, Imon, Apurugh, Ayero, Tsuam, Abiji, Tsamia, Ikposogye, Ushitile, Angwan Mallam,Kayerda, Nomadic, Ubele, Nyitwev, Amachenge, Igbatim, Agon, Abaagu, among others.
