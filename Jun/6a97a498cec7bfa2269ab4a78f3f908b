A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia State and a youth activist, Nwabueze Onwuneme, has appealed to Middle Belt and southern leaders not to drag Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and its Chairman, Prof. Yakubu Mahmood, to ethnic/partisan politics. He also advised that Mahmood should be assessed strictly on his competence and performance not on ethnic sentiments. Reacting to the call by the leaders to President Muhammadu to relieve the INEC boss of his duties, because he comes from the same geographical zone with President Buhari, Onwuneme said that since the Nigerian Senate, made up of politicians representing all Nigerians, has painstakingly screened and approved of his leadership of the electoral body, finding no blemish on his person, it would be unfair to call for his removal especially when he has not been found wanting in the discharge of his duties. Onwuneme stated that rather than focus on the ethnic nationality of INEC boss, who he said has discharged his duty credibly well as can be seen in the credibility/fairness of recent elections conducted by INEC in Anambra and others where even All Progressives Congress lost woefully, he appealed to the leaders to support, commend and also criticise where necessary the INEC boss and the commission strictly based on their performance and leave out ethnic/partisan sentiments.
