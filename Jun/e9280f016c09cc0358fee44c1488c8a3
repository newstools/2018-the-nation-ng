Navy personnel have been warned to stay off drugs or face dismissal. The Flag Officer Commanding (FOC), Naval Training Command (NAVTRAC), Rear Admiral Obi Ofodile, gave this charge during the command’s 10km quarterly route march attended by about 1000 personnel. Ofodile said the navy usually conducted medical test for its personnel, adding that routine route marches were also fixed to ascertain those physically and mentally fit. Ofodile said: “The purpose is for those who are not well to be taken care of so that they can perform their military functions creditably. “In Nigeria today, if you read the newspapers, there are problems of drug abuse by youths of this country which is not limited to civilians alone but all over the place. “So, once in a while we alert and warn the personnel to shun drugs that are not prescribed by trained medical doctors.”
