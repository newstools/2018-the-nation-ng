The Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has concluded plans to deploy equipment worth over $40 million to Calabar port, in Cross  River State, its Managing Director, Ms Hadiza Bala Usman, said yesterday. The measure, it was gathered, is being taken  to boost efficiency, security and make the port attractive for business. Speaking at a stakeholders’ meeting organised by NPA at Calabar port complex, Ms Usman, who was represented by the General Manager Marine and Operations,  Mr Joshua Asanga, said some tug boats, pilot cutters and other equipment worth several millions of dollars would be deployed to boost efficiency at the port. Although, Ms Usman did not state the amount of the equipment, but sources at Calabar port said it would cost  the agency more than $40million to deploy the sofisticated equipment and operational vehicles. The NPA chief said the four consultants engaged by the agency for the bathymetric survey of the channel leading to Calabar port have concluded their assignment so that the dredging of the channel will commence. She condemned indiscriminate abandoning of wrecks on the channel leading to the port warning owners to remove them or face sanctions. She urged investors to take advantage of the strategic location of the Calabar port to boost export and assured them of Federal Government’s commitment to dredging the channel to meet their expectations. Ms Usman assured the stakeholders and investors that adequate depth of the channel leading to the port would be dredged  to accommodate big ocean going vessels and adequate security provided. She urged government agencies at the port to collaborate to key into the Federal Government policy on ease of doing business, boost cargo clearance and facilitate trade.
