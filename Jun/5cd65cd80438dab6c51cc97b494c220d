Manna Prayer Mountain Worldwide will on Saturday begin a free medical care in Ogudu and Lekki areas of Lagos. According to the General Overseer of the Church, Bishop Chris Kwakpovwe, the medical outreach would include check-ups and diagnosis. He said the church would also visit some orphanages, hospitals, widows and prisons. Kwakpovwe, who is also the Publisher of a daily devotional, ‘Our Daily Manna’, spoke in a press conference yesterday, in his Ogudu, Lagos office. “We have done the medical outreach, but we are now  extending to impact humanity through our visitation to orphanages, hospitals, widows and prisons and I will be praying for the people”. On the issue of Mrs Tamara Egbedi, who sued the church and Bishop Kwakpovwe, over losing seven teeth and a fractured jaw during the church programme on January 22, 2010, Bishop Kwakpovwe said, he does not know Egbedi and he has nothing against her.
