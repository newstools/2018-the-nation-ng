The Federal Government said it would deepen its relationship with the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) to boost the national economy. The Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, made this known in Abuja when he received the Chamber’s representatives in his office. According to him, the aim of such collaboration was to strengthen Private-Public Partnership (PPP) towards national development. “Ministry of Science and Technology is at the centre of all economic activities and partnering  the Chamber of Commerce is a right step the country is taking. “The ministry is not only looking for foreign investors, but also local investors and partners that will lead the way for the foreign investors as the country is looking into various areas of technologies. “We want the Chamber to come in and take advantage of the work that we have done, to complete our research activities and come up with a product that we can develop further to put in the market. We are willing to give this to you as we want Nigerian firms to take advantage of this,” Onu said. The minster said LCCI was notnew to science and technology, adding that it had been in existing for 130 years and had been a part of every technology in the country. Chairman of Construction and Engineering Group of the LCCI, Mr. Leye Kupoluyi, who led the team, said the chamber had been at the forefront of technologies in Nigeria. He, therefore, appealed to the minister to further work with the chamber to advance technology growth.
