The Lagos State Employability Trust Fund (LSETF) has praised Bia Live well for providing jobs for 50 youths. The firm, LSETF said, has grown from one outlet to three. Bia Live Well is a bar with fruit cocktails, selling fresh juices, smoothies and frozen yoghurts, with the cocktails made from fresh berries and fruits. At the launching of its new outlet at Alausa Secretariat, Ikeja, LSETF Stakeholders Management and Communication Officer Joaquim MacEbong explained that the agency funds businesses with the aim that they are going to grow, adding that the new outlet and the new people that are going to receive jobs is exactly what LSETF aims to achieve. “This is one particular business that we are really proud of because when we funded it initially, it had only one outlet but has now grown to become three. As a result of this, the outlets have employed more people and it is doing much better which is exactly what we are always joyous of,” he said. Joaquim admonished budding entrepreneurs to be focused, gain knowledge by knowing what the market wants and also be courageous, saying that there are lots of challenges in business. MacEbong said the agency is exerting all its efforts in trying to improve the environment for businesses to thrive in Lagos, assuring that with enough focus people will continue to survive business-wise. Explaining the duties of the agency, he said “we provide loan facilities and organise trainings for unemployed youths. The Loan program is for three sets – SMEs where you can borrow a maximum of N5 million; Micro enterprises where you can borrow N500,000; and startups, those who do not have any businesses but have  training certificates are eligible to borrow N250,000. All these are at five percent annual retainment” He added that the agency is also helping people who do not have jobs to get trainings in order for them to get employed through their employability support programme.
