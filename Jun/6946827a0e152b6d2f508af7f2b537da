The Edo State Private Property Protection (PPP) Taskforce has handed over one Mr. Samuel Osagie, to the State Command of the Nigerian Police, over alleged impersonation of officials of the taskforce. Samuel Osagie was arrested in Benin City, Edo State, after the taskforce received report of his criminal activities including duping unsuspecting members of the public who seek the service of the Taskforce on land disputes. Spokesman for the Taskforce, Mr. Osaro Idah, said the alleged fraudster, who has confessed to the crime, collected between N100,000 to N150,000 from his victims as he goes about posing as an official of the Taskforce. According to Idah, “Osagie collects money from his victims with the promise to use the money to process court petitions and documents on behalf of the victims.” He urged members of the public to be vigilant against activities of individuals who go about posing as officials of the Taskforce, noting, “the services of the taskforce are completely free. People who have dealings with Mr. Samuel Osagie should know that they are doing so at their own risk.” The spokesman said that Mr. Samuel who paraded himself as a member of the taskforce has no business with the taskforce. One of the victims of Osagie, Mrs. Patience Obaware, said she was referred to the Private Property Taskforce from the Palace of the Oba of Benin to seek redress over a land dispute in Ogheghe village. She said that after she was referred to the Taskforce, she met Mr. Samuel Osagie, who claimed to be a member of the committee and promised to assist her after demanding money, which he said he would use to processing her court documents.
