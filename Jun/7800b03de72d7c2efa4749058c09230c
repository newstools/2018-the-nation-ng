The People’s Democratic Party in Edo State has accused President Muhammadu Buhari of making June 12 a Yoruba affair. It said the essence of June 12 should reflect on all those who fought for the survival of democracy in the country instead of making it a Yoruba affair. State chairman of the party, Chief Dan Orbih, who spoke while addressing newsmen in Benin City said some persons who fought for the actualization of democracy were not short listed in the recent list of those to be honoured. “Today, people are talking of June 12 and nobody is talking about Prof. Omo Omoruyi. This is to me, an attempt by some group of politicians who want to make June 12 a Yoruba affair. “What is good for those who fought for June 12 is good for all. You do not need to come from certain section of the country to be recognized for your nationalistic contributions towards our democratic government. “So, June 12 is a watershed in the politics of Nigeria where people from all tribes supported that the military must be ease out of power. “So, the attempt to tribalize, politicize it by the federal government is quite unfortunate”, he said.
