Muyiwa, the son of the late Attorney General of the Federation, Chief Bola Ige, has been sworn in with 44 others into the board of the Architects Registration Council (ARCON). The Osun State nominee is followed by Isah Alidu (Borno), Adekoyejo Jolaosho (Ogun), Dipo Ajayi (Ekiti), among others. At the inauguration of the board in Abuja, the Minister of Power, Works and Housing, Babatunde Fashola (SAN), tasked the members of the reconstituted council to fulfil President Muhammadu Buhari’s mandate to the people. He said the President needed men and women of good character to build a nation of the citizens’ dream. The minister said some names were earlier sent but were discovered to be unqualified during the screening. Fashola noted that the council was expected to determine the standard of education and experience necessary to be a practising architect in the country. He said: “I want you to consider your appointment as a call to national service, especially as a participation or contribution of your quota to help President Buhari build Nigeria.” The minister said the National Housing Programme was at various stages of completion in 34 states. According to him, the revised National Building Code has been approved to help the country address its housing deficit, reduce building collapse and enable the nation to achieve the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reducing climate change. Fashola said the code was passed after consultations with states’ commissioners for housing and other relevant stakeholders. He added: “I’m glad to inform you that we have passed the Revised National Building to help the built industry. “We, therefore, urge you to ensure buildings are utilised, constructed and designed in such a way that public health and safety are not compromised.” Ige hailed the Federal Government for his appointment. He said it would enable him contribute his quota to the challenge of building collapse in the country.
