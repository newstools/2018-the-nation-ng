The National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, (PDP), Prince Uche Secondus has said that more Nigerians are getting killed under President Muhammadu Buhari than ever before. Secondus, in a statement on Monday by his media aide, Ike Abonyi, also said many more Nigerians are getting poorer and hungrier in the Buhari administration. Reacting to Sunday’s killing of hundreds of people in Barki Ladi local government area of Plateau State, the party chair said nothing can justify the continued bloodletting in the country. The statement said, “The federal government and its security agencies appear to have switched off on the killings and now concentrating on how to intimidate people and win election at all cost. “Otherwise, how do one explain the genocide in Plateau that was carried out for over five hours and there was no interruption from any security body in a distance less than 20 kilometers from Jos the state capital, headquarters of an Army and Air Force divisions with Police, Directorate of State Services DSS, Civil Defence and others. “If we have a government that cares, this horror should not happen to innocent citizens for whatever crime, more so that the report showed that the victims were harmless worshippers and residents sleeping in their homes “Intelligence no longer works in this country that such massacre would be planned in Plateau that is prone to violence without any hint to avert it”. According to the party chair, the APC led federal government is consumed by plans force themselves on Nigerians, even when it’s obvious that they have lost the goodwill Nigerians gave the party in 2015. Secondus accused the federal government of scheming to thwart the will of Nigerians in 2019, through poor governance.
