Ahmed Musa is basking in confidence to score again for Nigeria ahead of tonight’s crunch clash against Argentina. Musa, 25, scored the two goals that gave Nigeria victory over Iceland in the Group D fixture of the ongoing FIFA World Cup in Russia. The Leicester City forward reckoned that he has always scored against the Argentina national team and Lionel Messi, stating that he has a target to continue his scoring streak against the La Albiceleste on Tuesday. He said, ‘Whenever I play against Argentina, or whenever Messi is playing against me, I score. ‘Four years ago I scored two goals. When I transferred to Leicester City and we played against Barcelona I scored another two goals, so I think in the next game anything can happen. ‘Possibly, I’m going to score another two goals.’ The Eagles forward bagged a brace against Argentina at the 2014 World Cup, although Nigeria lost the match 3-2, with Messi also scoring two. Then in 2016, Musa scored two more when he lined up against Messi, this time in a pre-season friendly between Leicester City and Barcelona. Musa was on the losing side, as Barcelona beat the Foxes 4-2. The game will get underway at 7pm on Tuesday night with Iceland and Croatia playing at the same time. The team to join Croatia in the knockout phase will either France, or Denmark or Australia in the round of 16.
