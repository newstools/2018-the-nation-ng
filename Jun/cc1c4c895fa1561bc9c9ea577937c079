A non-governmental Organisation (NGO), Environment Watch Initiative (EWI), has taken the Beat Plastic Pollution campaign to Lagos markets. It held a rally on Saturday at the Iyana-Iba Market to educate traders on the dangers of indiscriminate disposal of plastic waste. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the theme of the 2018 World Environment Day celebrated on June 5  was: Beat Plastic Pollution. EWI Director and the rally convener Dr Cyril Amadi, said: “The earlier people come to terms with the inherent dangers of plastic pollution, the better for the society. “We are talking of a sustainable environment; this campaign did not come out of wishful thinking; the problem is staring us all on the face. “It is, therefore, pertinent for the government to create a means of recycling plastics.” Amadi called for attitudinal change by the  residents toward plastic waste disposal. An environmentalist, Mr Peter Obot, said the world was contending with the menace of the unwholesome disposal of plastic waste. According to him, a tonne of plastic can cause a huge social problem.  “Since it seems we cannot do without plastic, we should endeavour to dispose of them properly. “Its health hazard to human being especially when it is used to block drains causes monumental epidemics to the society. “It also causes flooding that results in building collapse, disruption of farms and the ecosystem,” Obot said.
