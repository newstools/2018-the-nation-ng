Chicharito admitted that Mexico’s victory over Germany in their FIFA World Cup opener on Sunday was an emotional one for him – but insists Mexico is focused on ensuring it won’t be the high point of their campaign. El Tri stunned Joachim Low’s defending champions in Moscow, with Hirving Lozano’s first-half goal – following a perfectly-weighted through ball from Chicharito – proving enough to secure a 1-0 success. The three points meant Mexico got their World Cup off to the perfect start, and now Chicharito wants to help make the 2018 tournament one to remember for his country, as they target progressing beyond the Round of 16 for the first time since 1986. First, though, the Hammers striker will take a moment to reflect on one of Mexico’s finest results in their history. “After the final whistle I celebrated it the way I could, like someone emotional,” he said. “In the locker room some laughed, others shouted, I celebrated it my way, I was the one who cried the most. “We have taken a very important step, and we have to go calmly, to enjoy it. We are very excited, we have started the World Cup on the right foot, but from tomorrow we will start working 100% towards the match against South Korea. “If we don’t win that match and the one against Sweden, beating Germany would have served no purpose at all.” Chicharito formed part of a front three alongside PSV Einhoven’s Lozano and Porto man Miguel Layun which caused Germany no end of problems on the counter-attack. He was delighted to play his part, especially in front of such a strong Mexican support. He added: “I tried to give everything, in the best way, I gave an assist. Lozano had a great match too, here there are no heroes, we all played great, from Memo (Ochoa) to Javier. “We feel like we were playing at home, the anthem ceremony was extremely exciting.”
