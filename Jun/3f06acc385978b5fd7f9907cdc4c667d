Ahead of its July 5, 2018 closing date, entries have continued to pour in for the Multichoice Talent Factory Academy. The MTF initiative which offers hopefuls a lifetime opportunity to be part of the company’s Pan-African social investment Initiative for Film and Television industry will be delivered through three touchpoints: the MTF academies, Masterclasses and the MTF Portal. The MTF Academy is a 12-month, fully-funded educational programme aimed at furnishing 60 deserving young people with skills to work and innovate in film and television production. The academy will take place in Lagos, Nigeria for Western Africa countries. “We’re delighted to see the amount of enthusiasm this initiative has so far received by all our stakeholders,” said MultiChoice Director of the Talent Factory, Cheryl Uys-Allie. “It’s important that we reach all the corners of the continent where there are undiscovered gems waiting to be cut and polished so that we display their magnificent talent therefore, we’d like to encourage anyone who wants to grow their skills in the film and TV industry to visit the Talent factory website to complete the entry application form today.” Interested participants have been urged to register online before the deadline of July 5, 2018. Following the adjudication process, 20 post-school MTF students will be selected to hone their television and film production skills in the company of industry experts during the year-long programme that will begin on October 1, 2018.
