Russia Police have returned the $11,000 (about N4m) which was stolen from kanu Nwankwo at the Moscow Airport at the weekend. A source close to the former Nigeria international confirmed this to NationSport on Monday. “Yes Papilo is grateful. The Russia police and security agencies were very helpful. They recovered it in hours and returned the money to him,” the source said. NationSport reports that the 41-year-old took part in a FIFA Legend Game in Russia on Sunday. The money was reportedly stolen from Kanu’s suitcase which he discovered at the hotel and quickly alerted the authorities. The incident has brought security matters in Russia to the fore with the World Cup just 10 days away. Nigeria are due to land in Russia on June 11 from Austria, five  days before their opening game against Croatia.
