The Federal Government has increased Super Eagles winning bonus to $15,000, about (N5M) ahead of their second group game against Iceland on Friday at the Volgograd Arena. The Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung who made this known said, the 50% increment from the initial $10,000 about (N3.5M) which was promised will go along way boost the team to a winning way. “It is unfortunate that we did not win, which would have served as a morale booster at the group stage, but we will not lose hope. “The Federal Government is doing its best to ensure that the Super Eagles excel in Russia. Even President Muhammadu Buhari took time out to motivate the players yesterday and to assure them of his unflinching support for the team. “I personally added $5,000 to their winning bonus to motivate the team, but we must still keep our hopes alive because this is just the beginning. “I urge the players to remain focused while the technical department will have to put heads together with the coach to salvage our next two matches against Iceland and Argentina. If we win our next matches against Iceland and Argentina, then we can qualify from the group.” he said. Dalung however called on Nigerians to continue to support the team regardless of the disappointing outing against Croatia. ”The Super Eagles are a work in progress. It’s a very young team and we are nurturing them for greater exploits, not only for now but also for the future. We are not giving any excuses but we must continue to rally round our team, irrespective of the result recorded on Saturday. “I appeal to Nigerians to rally behind the team and pray for them ahead of their next game against Iceland. I strongly believe that despite the disappointing start, the Super Eagles will come out strong from the group.” Nigeria currently sit at the bottom of Group D.
