WBC world heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder has branded Anthony Joshua and his promoter Eddie Hearn “cowards”. On Tuesday, it emerged Joshua had been ordered by the WBA to agree a deal to face Russia’s Alexander Povetkin. The move means any bout between Joshua – who also holds the IBF and WBO belts – and Wilder, looks set to be delayed. In an expletive-laden tweet, Wilder said: “You’re not a true champion You’re just a weak minded coward that’s holding hard metal. #Facts.” He continued: “All they had to do is say they were scared to fight. Period. But instead they made themselves look like what they are, not stand up guys. “I’m so happy it’s over now I’ve done my part.” Any bout between Joshua, 28, and Wilder, 32, would see the winner become the first man in history to hold all four heavyweight world titles. It would also prove to be one of the most lucrative in the sport’s history and Wilder’s series of tweets contained insults about both Joshua and promoter Hearn. He said Joshua and Hearn had “led boxing fans on for three months”, adding they “never wanted this fight”. Povetkin knocked out David Price in March to become mandatory challenger. He has 34 wins from 35 bouts with his one defeat coming against Wladimir Klitschko in 2013.
