The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Monday re-arraigned Col. Nicholas Ashinze, an ex-Special Assistant to former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, and eight others on a 13-count charge of money laundering. The EFCC accused the defendants of money laundering offences including the alleged transfer of N1, 840,000,000. EFCC elected to re-arraign the defendants before another judge, Justice Babatunde Quadri, after the earlier trial judge, Justice Gabriel Kolawole, withdrew from the case. Also re-arraigned with Ashinze were – the Managing Director of Geonel Integrated Services Limited, Wolfgang Reinl; a lawyer,  Edidiong Idiong; and Lt.-Col. Sagir D. Mohammed (retd). The other defendants are companies. They include Geonel Integrated Services Limited, Unity Continental Nigeria Limited, Helpline Organisation, Vibrant Resource Limited and Sologic Integrated Services Limited. In count one, the EFCC accused the defendants of conspiracy to commit money laundering offences contrary to section 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011, and punishable under section 15(3) and (4) of the same law. In counts two to seven, EFCC alleged that Ashinze, Reinl and Geonel Integrated Services Limited corruptly transferred N1.84billion to Idiong, Mohammed, Sologic Integrated Services Limited, Vibrant Resource Limited and Helpline Organisation.
