Russia authorities have been busy raiding the city of Yessentuki for illegal sex workers as they clear the area ahead of Nigeria’s arrival for the 2018 FIFA World Cup on Monday. The Super Eagles who are drawn in Group D along with Argentina, Iceland and Croatia will be based in Yessentuki during the tournament.According to reports from Russia, the women of easy virtue are anxiously waiting for the three-time African Champions who have been banned by head coach Gernot Rohr from having any dealings with them. According to Vladimir Vladimirov, the Governor of the Stavropol Territory where Yessentuki is located, he said the police will make it impossible for the sex workers to operate their trade.“Officials from Nigeria, Egypt and others will have their base in this city for the tournament and we have warned against patronage of illegal strippers and others, most brothels have also been told to simply close down.”“However, for the 30-day tournament only those with a significant “krysha” (the Russian for “roof“), that sees them pay a percentage of their earnings to officials and police in return for protection, will be able to operate,” he added.Russia President Vladimir Putin had described Russian prostitutes as the “best in the world”. Back in the early 90s, the sex industry in Russia was considered very notorious.Previous events such as the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics have seen the Russian police impose harsh fines on sex workers and in some cases imprison them for the duration of the competition.
