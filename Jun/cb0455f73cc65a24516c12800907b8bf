Former West Ham striker Diafra Sakho has dedicated Senegal’s win over Poland to the whole of Africa and said it was time an African nation fulfilled Pele’s prophecy to win the World Cup 2018. Senegal became the first African team to win three points in Russia with a 2-1 victory over Poland in Moscow’s Spartak Stadium. It followed opening-game defeats for Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and Nigeria, while Mo Salah’s Pharaohs lost again to Russia on Tuesday night, leaving them on the brink of elimination. Just as in 2014, when the whole of Africa appeared to mourn Ghana’s controversial quarter-final exit to Uruguay, Sakho stated that the continent was united behind its five World Cup representatives. The Rennes forward claimed the support powered Senegal to Tuesday’s victory and hopes such backing, would not be long in coming before an African side is crowned world champions — as Brazilian legend Pele famously predicted would happen by 2000. “Four African teams lost their first games and today we’re just happy to win this game,” Sakho said afterwards. “The whole of the African continent waits for this. I’m just happy for Senegal. “Today the World Cup is very important for African teams. We saw Egypt, Tunisia and Nigeria lose their first games and playing for Africa gave us power. Today all of Africa is happy with our win.” The dynamics could scarcely be more different in Europe or South America, where shared borders mean fiercer rivalries and Sakho added: “It’s true it’s not the same in Europe but it’s important. “We need to stay together if the African continent is going to win a World Cup. It’s very important job for us to keep it this way, to play together. We’re going to do a lot of victories.”
