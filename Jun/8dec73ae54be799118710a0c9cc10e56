There were numerous side attractions to the APC national convention. One of such was the five or so minute victory dance by the partyâ€™s new national chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State, Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State and Information Minister Lai Mohammed moment after Oshiomhole was confirmed as chairman. Of the lot, el-Rufai seemed to have won the most hearts in the state box with his youthful and energetic dance steps. Ministers not recognised as delegates Several serving ministers attended the convention as observers as the party constitution does not recognise them as delegates. Only ministers who are former governors or former legislators participated as delegates. How journalists struggled to send stories Journalists accredited to cover the convention had a hectic time linking up with their newsrooms from the venue as signals of most of the service providers kept fluctuating in view of the large number of phone users who had converged there. They had to move from one end to the other to see if they could be lucky with signals.
