Harry Kane struck a hat-trick as England marched into the last 16 of the World Cup after a record 6-1 win over a woeful Panama in their World Cup Group G match on Sunday. The result, a record win for England in a World Cup finals match, means England qualify for the knockout stage with a game to spare, along with Belgium who also have six points. Tournament debutants Panama are eliminated along with Tunisia. England was 5-0 up at halftime after taking full advantage of a poor Panamanian defence. A header from a corner by John Stones, a penalty from Kane and a beautiful strike from the edge of the box by Jesse Lingard set them on their way. A Stones header from a well-worked free-kick routine and a second Kane penalty gave them a 5-0 lead going into the break. The England captain, now the tournament’s top scorer with five goals, completed his hat-trick when a shot from Ruben Loftus-Cheek deflected in off the Tottenham forward in the 62nd minute. Kane became just the third England player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup game following Geoff Hurst in 1966 final and Gary Lineker against Poland in the 1986 tournament. Panama pulled a goal back in the 78th minute through Felipe Baloy, the Central American nation’s first goal at a World Cup. (Reuters/NAN)
