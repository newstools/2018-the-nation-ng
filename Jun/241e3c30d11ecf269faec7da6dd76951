The World Cup 2018 is upon us and kicks off with hosts Russia taking on Saudi Arabia at the Luzhniki Stadium. How both sides approach the tournament’s curtain raiser will be intriguing as it could make or break their chances of advancing from Group A. Russia has not won a single game in eight months and what better time for the host nation to finally bring an end to that unwanted run than in the opening match of the World Cup. A winless streak of seven matches beats both Russian and Soviet records and isn’t altogether surprising, considering they are the lowest ranked team among the 32 at the tournament, slumping to 70th in the world according to the latest FIFA standings. A disruptive build-up to the World Cup with head coach Stanislav Cherchesov falling out with several key players hasn’t done them any good and has made for a depleted squad short of quality. However, with Saudi Arabia to play first, they’re presented with the best opportunity to finally get a victory under their belts. The Middle East outfit is ranked only three places above the hosts. There is also the small matter of home court advantage that Russia will have going for them. If they can secure a win against the Eagles, they can nurse the hope of progressing to the round of 16. Russian media though has not painted a picture of optimism, asking instead if things can possibly get any worse. “We have to take all the criticisms and turn it into something positive,” Cherchesov told reporters. “The first game will be the most important one because it will leave its stamp on the entire campaign,” he added. Meanwhile, a supposedly clairvoyant cat has predicted a win for Russia in the first match. Achilles, a deaf white cat and the official animal soothsayer for the tournament chose a bowl of food bearing Russia’s flag rather than that of Saudi Arabia.
