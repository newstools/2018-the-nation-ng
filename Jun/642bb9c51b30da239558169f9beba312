The Lagos State University (LASU) yesterday debunked claims that a man, Kingsley Gabriel, who jumped into the lagoon on Monday, is its student. Gabriel was rescued by Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) officials after jumping into the lagoon off Falomo Bridge. LASWA General Manager Damilola Emmanuel said attempted suicide act was becoming rampant and worrisome on Lagos waterways. According to him, “the student was quickly rescued from drowning in the water by LASWA officials who responded swiftly by jumping into the lagoon.” Gabriel, Emmanuel said, was taken to the Falomo Police Station after he was rescued. LASU spokesperson and the Students Union President. Ademola Martin Adekoya and Samuel Moshood Olalere, told The Nation that Gabriel’s name was not in the university’s database. Olalere said: “We have to approach the Office of the Dean of Students Affairs to look into our database, but we realised no one bears that name Kingsley Gabriel. “We don’t know yet if the victim is our student but his name misspelt; but I can categorically tell you we have no such name in our record.” Aside the university database, Olalere said the Students Union also has its personal database where names and pictures of registered students can be ascertained. “We have our own generalised platform and upon the news yesterday, we logged on the name ‘Gabriel Kingsley’ but none of our students’ identity tallies with that name.” Management, Adekoya said, had now only acted on the victim’s name and was yet to visit Falomo Police Station or the hospital. “But I think our security unit is doing something about that now,” he said.
