Following the release of his single, ‘Play Love’, Solomon Ifeanyi who is also known as Sniffy has disclosed that he is working on another song titled ‘Slowly.’ Speaking about the song, the Delta State indigene who discovered his singing ability at a tender age while mimicking music legend Michael Jackson said the song will blow listeners’ minds because of the quality he has put in it. The songwriter is confident that his yet-to-be-released singles; OMG, Slowly and Controller will rock the music industry when released. “I have worked on a video (Play Love) that have made me proud as an entertainer and my next project is already in the works, which is visuals for my new unreleased single Slowly, but will require time to get done,” said Sniffy. “Besides that, I’m just trying to evolve myself as an artiste, which includes my sound and my Dancing style. I went a bit harder with my tracks lately, but I can’t say anything about the sounds I will create in the future.” Sniffy, who has released four songs, including ‘Love You’, ‘Go Low’, ‘Ibadi’ and ‘Strongthing’ is a graduate of Chemistry from the University of Abuja.
