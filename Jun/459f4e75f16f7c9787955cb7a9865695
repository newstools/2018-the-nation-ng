*Buni, Kashim, Bulama, Yerima battle for APC National Secretary slot
*Okorocha in battle royale with Izunazo, South-East stakeholders
*Gbemi Saraki leaves option open, may opt for roles in PCO
*Buhari’s decision may hold the ace on key positions
*Niyi Adebayo may emerge Deputy National Chairman (South) All Progressives Congress (APC) governors and several other party top shots are now locked in a fresh battle for the control of party structures in the wake of the withdrawal of Chief John Odigie-Oyegun from the chairmanship race. Odigie-Oyegun confirmed on Friday  ahead of the June 23 national convention of the APC that he would not be seeking a fresh mandate. He cited party’s overall interest as his reason. His withdrawal leaves the door wide open for ex-Edo State Governor Adams Oshiomhole to replace him. But the scramble for other offices has now sparked an intense horse-trading by governors and leaders of the party who want to install their loyalists in the various posts. Although Oshiomole already has the backing of President Muhammadu Buhari to replace Oyegun, the president’s strategists are perfecting plans to also  influence the emergence of the party’s next  National Secretary, Deputy National Chairman(North);  Deputy National Chairman (South); National Organizing Secretary, National Publicity Secretary and either National Women Leader or National Youth Leader. Some of Buhari’s strategists are understood to be working with some governors and leaders on a Unity List to guide the National Convention. However, the outcome of ongoing peace talks between Vice President Yemi Osinbajo and the leaders of the nPDP leaders may alter or enhance the Unity List. Mala, Imam, Bulama Yerima seek to be Secretary Four party members have emerged as the leading contenders for the post of APC national secretary. They are the incumbent, Mallam Mai Mala Buni (Yobe); a cerebral politician, Alhaji Kashim Imam (Borno); Buhari’s ardent loyalist, Waziri Bulama; and Dr. Haruna Yerima. A top level party source said party leaders from Borno State have been “agitating for the zoning of the National Secretary to them since Yobe State currently occupies the position of Senate Leader. They also claim that Yobe has maintained the slot since 2014. “But Yobe Governor, Alhaji Ibrahim Geidam has been making a strong case for Mai Mala Buni who may have to forego his governorship ambition in 2019 to retain the seat. APC leaders have also alleged that Borno has cornered almost all appointments zoned to the North-East including Chief of Staff to the President,  National Security Adviser, Chief of Army Staff, and others. “Bauchi, Gombe, Taraba, and Adamawa are also demanding the office. The governors have however started discussions on how to resolve the issue amicably because the North-East is strategic for the President. Governor Kashim Shettima is coordinating mutual negotiation in this respect.” Shuaibu, gov’s candidate jostle for Dep. Chair (North) The battle for the post of Deputy National Chairman (North) is likely to be between the incumbent, Senator Lawal Shuaibu who is from Zamfara State and a yet-to-be known candidate being promoted by Governor Nasir el-Rufai and a minister who are uncomfortable that Shuaibu is from the Action Congress of Nigeria caucus of the APC coalition. His sin is said to be his political acquaintance over the years with a national leader of the party. Shuaibu is highly experienced in party politics and he is enjoying the support of his state governor, Alhaji Abdulaziz Yari. Yari has already told some of his colleagues that he will support Shuaibu. Yari allegedly sent three governors to Shuaibu on his position. The outgoing National Vice Chairman (North-West), Inuwa Abdulkadir (Sokoto State) might face similar hurdles from el-Rufai, to get re-elected. A source said: “The Deputy National Chairman (North) enjoys goodwill among party leaders across the six geopolitical zones. His ongoing efforts to facilitate talks between the Presidency and nPDP leaders might add value to his campaign for re-election. “The only challenge facing Shuaibu is from Governor el-Rufai and a minister who are politically uncomfortable with his ACN antecedents. El-Rufai is a favourite of the outgoing National Chairman of APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun. But Oyegun and Shuaibu have been patching their relationship in the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). “For instance, Oyegun has queried why he was not well-integrated in the ongoing talks with nPDP after he approved of Shuaibu’s initiative. Oyegun complained of allegedly being sidelined. “In spite of the fact that Abdulkadir draws much strength from the backing of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, he has had a running crisis with el-Rufai, whose government demolished Abdulkadir’s house in Kaduna, might not leave his political fate to his political ‘enemy’ in the North-West. Niyi Adebayo may have an easy ride as Dep. Chair (South) The post of Deputy National Chairman (South) appears destined to return to Ekiti State with former governor of the state, Otunba Niyi Adebayo favoured to get it. He will be replacing Engineer Segun Oni who resigned recently to contest the party’s governorship primaries. The source rated Adebayo, a “natural choice for the office of Deputy National Chairman (South) which was recently vacated by ex-Governor Segun Oni.” It is also expected that Chief Henry Ajomale may emerge as National Vice Chairman (Southwest). Ajomale is immediate past chairman of the party in Lagos State.  Okorocha ready to stop Izunaso’s return as Organising Sec The jostle for the National Organizing Secretary has pitched the Chairman of the APC Governors Forum, Governor Rochas Okorocha against party leaders in the South-East led by the Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu. While the South-East leaders have resolved to back the present office holder, Senator Osita Izunaso, the governor has vowed to resist his choice for allegedly undermining him politically and plotting his loss of party structure in Imo State. A top source said: “We opted for Izunaso because he has performed, and in order to sustain the tempo of checking the excesses of Okorocha. In this roforofo fight, Izunaso fits the game plan. Izunaso has his own problems but we are waging a war of liberation against Okorocha and the outgoing National Organizing Secretary is our beacon. “We all resolved to separate APC from Okorocha whose conduct might not earn our party electoral fortunes. He has allegedly offended the church which determines the political direction in the South-East. Okorocha is saying as the only APC governor in the South-East, he is more of a political asset than other APC leaders in the zone. He has insisted that the presidency and party leaders should listen to him. “But Abuja factor may set in with some loyalists of Buhari already looking forward to the choice of Emeka Nwajuba who has been a long term associate of the President.” Bolaji Abdullahi gets rivals for Nat.Publicity secretary post The battle for the office of the National Publicity Secretary may turn out to be a battle of senior editors and a blogger. The incumbent, ex-Minister Bolaji Abdullahi is being challenged  by his kinsman, Lanre Issa Onilu (who is in Sen. Gbemisola Saraki’s camp), ex-Tell Magazine correspondent, Duro Meseko (who is a former member of the House of Representatives from Kogi State and Abu Sidiqque (Kogi), a loyalist of Buhari being sponsored by some presidential aides. Another source added: “Except for the unending rivalry and crisis of confidence among some APC elders, Bolaji has handled the party’s image with maturity and professionalism. “His profile as a writer as added value to the image of the party. He has also not allowed prejudices to affect his role as the spokesman of the party. His measured responses to issues in recent times have endeared him to many governors and leaders of APC. “But the concerns about him border on the fact that Kwara State has occupied the office in the last four years to the detriment of other states in the North-Central; his political allegiance which may not favour Buhari’s agenda;  and Abdullahi’s  ambition to become the next governor of Kwara State which may leave the office vacant if he secures the ticket. “He also faces opposition from Kwara State where some APC leaders have maintained that the slot is meant for Kwara South Senatorial District which led to the emergence of Alhaji Lai Mohammed as the pioneer spokesman of the party. “The outcome of the talks between the Presidency and the nPDP leaders from Monday will determine the fate of Abdullahi. But he has to decide between a party post and gubernatorial ticket. He has to trade off one. “Apart from his antecedents as a former Group Politics Editor of ThisDay newspapers, the Public Relations dexterity of Lanre Issa Onilu, who once narrowly missed the opportunity of being a minister, has gained him some mileage.  He has managed the image of some high-profile clients leading to international recognition.  He is also in the camp of Sen. Gbemisola Saraki who is now a favourite of the Presidential Villa. “On his part, Duro Meseko, who was once a celebrated correspondent with Tell Magazine, is being supported by some APC bigwigs in the state although he belongs to James Faleke’s faction of the party. About 20 governors are said to have endorsed him but this is yet to be verified. “Abu Siddique, who is a famous blogger, commands the support of some presidential aides and strategists of the President. He is a sharp and blessed writer.” It was also gathered last night that a minister and four governors from the North-Central were meeting on the choice of the party’s spokesman. Investigation revealed that more aspirants may join the race in the coming week. A member of the National Convention Committee said: “The race is still open, we have not closed nominations at all. There are many offices and we are aware that horse-trading has started.” Gbemisola Saraki is said to have temporarily opted to be in the Presidential Campaign Organization of Buhari instead of being National Women Leader of APC. Buhari’s strategists appear to be contended with Hajiya Ramatu Aliyu (from the FCT) retaining her position as National Women Leader. A source described her yesterday as ‘not harmful.’ Another source in Buhari’s camp said: “The President holds the ace on some strategic positions in the party including chairmanship, National Secretary, Deputy National Chairman(North);  Deputy National Chairman(South); National Organizing Secretary, National Publicity Secretary and either National Women Leader or National Youth Leader. “Our camp is interested in at least seven key positions. We can no longer take things for granted.”
