•Aspirants dismiss consensus’ option SECRETARY of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Convention Planning Committee Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba said the party was studying court processes served on it from some states. Ndoma-Egba, who said the party will come up with its position, said the APC leadership has received court rulings in respect of delegates from some states and is studying them. He said: “We have received court processes in respect of some states and we are studying the process and probably, by this night, we should be able to arrive at something.” The party chieftain said about 20 persons are running unopposed and noted that there must, however, be voting for those positions to affirm them. However, one of the aspirants for the office of the National Secretary, Waziri Bulama, told The Nation that the convention committee only invited them to brief them on the modalities for the event and the logistics involved as well as how they are expected to conduct themselves. He said there was no mention of the issue of consensus during the meeting between the aspirants and the convention committee, adding that every candidate is expected to face the delegates. Bulama, who is believed to be the candidate of Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima, expressed confidence that he will emerge the national secretary. Another aspirant to the office of National Secretary, Alhaji Abdulrahaman Terab, dismissed the much talked about consensus or unity list, saying the delegates will decide on who they want to vote for tomorrow. He said the issue of consensus has only succeeded in dividing the stakeholders. He said he is in the race because of his belief that the party is at a critical position at the moment and need those who can help in rebuilding it into veritable vehicle for national development.
