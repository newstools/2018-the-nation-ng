 Super Eagles friendly against Three Lions of England tomorrow at Wembley might as well be a peep into what the a typical outing for both teams would be in Russia. Both teams are seeking to shine at the World cup and the friendly is an opportunity for Coach Gernot Rohr and England coach Gareth Southgate to properly assess their teams’ readiness for the world Cup. Super Eagles captain John Obi Mikel will square up against his England counterpart Harry Kane who was handed the responsibility of leading the three lions recently. Super Eagles fans both home and abroad are eager to watch the team take on England at Wembley as it is hoped that the performance at Wembley will reveal in clearer terms how well the team can play in Russia. The fairwell match against DR Congo which ended 1-1 in Port Harcourt is considered not too good as an assessment for the team considering complaints over the state of the pitch. London based fans of the team are already making frantic effort to acquire the team’s new jersey with intent to wear it to the friendly match billed for 6.15pm in Nigeria. The Dailymail in London this morning dished out long queue of fans of the Gernot Rohr tutored side waiting patiently to acquire the jersey. The jersey reportedly goes for £65 (about N32,000) even as some fans in Nigeria have revealed while contributing to sports programs on Radio that the selling price is N40,000.  While some say it is too high considering that the minimum wage in the country is N18,000 others say is at par with the price of most standard clubs especially in the English premiership
