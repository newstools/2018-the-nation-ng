According to the charge sheet, both Gwarzo and Garuba will face four-count charges at the FCT High Court. The charges are as follows: The spokesperson of ICPC, Mrs. Rasheedat Okoduwa said: “We have been notified by the court that the arraignment of the two suspects (Gwarzo and Garuba) will hold on Tuesday.” But Gwarzo, through his counsel,  Mr. A.U.
