The Imo State House of Assembly on Wednesday suspended four of its members for alleged “un-parliamentary” conducts. The affected lawmakers were Chiji Collins (Isiala Mbano Council Area) Ifeanyi Nnataraonye, (Mbaitoli Council Area) Uche Oguwuike, (Ikeduru Council Area) and Ikenna Nzeruo  (Oru west Council Area). The development further heightened political tension in the state as it was the first plenary after the national convention of All Progressives Congress in Abuja where supporters of the governor and his deputy engaged each other in a free-for -all while president Muhammadu Buhari was addressing the convention. The speaker of the state House of Assembly, Acho Ihim ,who presided over the plenary accused the suspended members of engaging in acts that are unbecoming of Lawmakers. The speaker immediately appointed Lawman Duruji who represents Ehime Mbano as the Chairman of the Committee that will look into the allegations leveled against the suspended House members. Ihim who did not give details of the allegations  announced that the suspension was indefinite, warning  that his leadership would not tolerate acts that would ridicule the Assembly before the members of the public.
