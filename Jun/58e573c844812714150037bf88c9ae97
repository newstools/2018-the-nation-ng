Lagos State Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgal has expressed concern over the rising cases of cultism among youths. He called for a state of emergency on cultism, stating that six out of 10 young people were cultists. Edgal spoke at a town hall meeting with some residents of Surulere, Lagos Mainland. The theme was: “Partnership with community for crime prevention.” He said he instructed one of his officers to conduct a research on the reason for the development. The result, he said, revealed that it gave members advantage over their peers and prevented them from being intimidated. He blamed parents for not caring enough for their children, saying that was responsible for the problem. Edgal praised Surulere residents for supporting crime fighting, adding that there had been reduction in crimes activities in the area. The success of crime fighting in the state, he said, could be attributed to information from of the public. He urged the residents to continue to provide information to the police, advising them report any unprofessional misconduct by police officers. Edgal urged parents and guardians to monitor their wards to prevent them from being used as thugs during the forthcoming general elections. “The election year is approaching and it is time we start talking to ourselves. Do not allow politicians to use your children as touts. All you need to do is get your Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC) and vote peacefully. Let us not allow some people to come from elsewhere to disrupt the peace in Lagos,” he said. He also warned against attack of police formations and property.
