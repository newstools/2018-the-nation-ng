Rector, Yaba College of Technology (YABATECH), Femi Omokungbe, says the institution’s Governing Council would take a decision about the court judgment directing the Polytechnic to reinstate Olu Ibirogba as Bursar and pay him N20 million in damages. The National Industrial Court Lagos Division in a ruling by Justice O.A Obaseki-Osaghae on June 7, 2018 nullified Ibirogba’s sack in July 2015 during the tenure of Dr Margaret Kudirat Ladipo. Speaking in an interview yesterday after the college’s matriculation, Omokungbe said: “It is not a challenge to fulfil the judgement. I also had a court case that I won. But I report to the Council. The case is Ibirogba against the Council so whatever direction the Council is taking, I don’t have a choice.” In a phone chat with The Nation, Ibirogba said he was happy about the judgement. He urged the government to back up the implementation of the judgement in line with its whistle blowing policy. “This is a battle of five years. I feel great and appreciative. I thank God for this.  I believe the government should prevail on the Council to obey the judgement because it is encouraging whistle blowers to come out and expose corruption,” he said. In all 3,666 National Diploma (ND) and 3,871 Higher National Diploma (HND) students took the oath at the polytechnic’s matriculation.
