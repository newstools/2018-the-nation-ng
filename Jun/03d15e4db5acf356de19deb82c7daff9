A yet to be identified man yesterday jumped into the Lagos lagoon in an apparent suicide move. The incident occurred on the Third Mainland Bridge around 6pm. It was gathered that the man, who was in a vehicle heading to Lagos Island, alighted, crossed to the other side of the bridge and dived into the water. Motorists, who took to social media to share the news, stated that before people could get to him, the man jumped into the water. It was gathered that the vehicle he was in zoomed off as soon as he alighted, raising suspicions that it could have been a taxi or car belonging to fraudsters, who used diabolical means to control their victims. As of press time, officials of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) were on the bridge in search of the man. LASEMA’s General Manager, Adesina Tiamiyu said they got report of the incident on social media and moved to the scene for search and rescue. He said: “I cannot tell you anything at the moment. We do not know for sure if someone jumped into the lagoon but we have to search in case it happened. “So far, we have not seen anyone. We have seen contradictory accounts of the incident on social media too but the operation would continue.”
