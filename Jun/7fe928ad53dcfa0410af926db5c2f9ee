The Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) said it has successfully reformed, by way of privatisation, commercialisation and in some cases concessioned, a total of 142 public enterprises, from 1999 till date through various transaction strategies. Its Director-General, Mr. Alex Okoh, who spoke yesterday in Abuja during a press briefing, said about N550 billion has been realised as proceeds from the privatisation of the 142 assets by the bureau. “However, it is not all of reforms that translate into sales and cash; for the assets that are just perhaps commercialised (that are not sold), you won’t see proceeds being reflected as in the figure mentioned earlier. “Of the 142, not all of them were privatised; some were commercialised, while some were merely concessioned. “The reform agenda and activities of the bureau have covered various sectors of the economy, including – agriculture, automobile, telecommunication, hotels and tourism, steel and aluminum, etc,” Okoh said.
