 Group stage opponents Argentina will throw all the arsenals in their armory into the tie against Super Eagles when both teams clash at the Saint Petersburg Stadium on June 26th. Indications to this effect emerged Monday when Argentine Football Association (AFA) President Claudio Tapia declared that the least the country desires to have is a semi final finish. The submission implies that the FA expects the team not only to merge from the Group D where they have been pitched against Iceland, Croatia and Nigeria with flourish  but also fight their way to the last four. Tapia who is hoping that Messi’s desire to clinch his first senior national team trophy comes to pass, noted that contribution of the Barcelona forward and 5-time Ballon d’Or winner has helped development of the game in the country on one hand and the football federation on the other. “Being in the top four is a positive goal,” Tapia told TyC Sports and while speaking on Messi he described as best player in the world added “He gives a lot to Argentine soccer, let’s face it, “The growth we have in the AFA is because we have the best player in the world.” Argentina will open their World Cup campaign against Iceland in Moscow on Saturday, and will round up their group stage ties with a clash against Nigeria on June 26. Forecasts ahead of the battle of Saint Petersburg gave Argentina 65% chance of winning the encounter with Eagles having only 13% chance of winning while the possibility of the game ending on a draw is put at 22%.
