Nollywood actress, Ify Okeke, who recently celebrated 20 years on stage, has revealed that she cried at the Rachel Okeke-Ozzoude Foundation (ROOF) outreach to celebrate widows. The event, tagged ‘Roof lives with smiles’ held on June 23 ensured that every widow present went home with the empowerment equipment and monetary gift made available by good Samaritan, who shared in the passion of giving and loving without reservations. Faces at the event include Eucharia Anuobi, Laide Bakare, Gloria Uba, Olori Jaiyeoba (President of God’sWife), Agatha Chukwura (President of Gold Crest), among others. One of the two bodies God’s Wife and Gold Crest, presently have a record of 5000 widows registered, with 2000 were catered for at the event. And the atmosphere moved the actress to tears. “I cried, seeing those women come out in numbers from different part to make the day beautiful”, says Okeke. “This is what I do and I enjoy doing it. I started up in my own little way with the assistance of my colleagues who we started out together. And as the year goes by, it became something big and I have been working with different organisations, and companies who come as sponsors to provide what we give to these women”. “We have widows as old as 83, who have been having it tough taking care of their needs and that of their children. But with ROOF, We have been able to impact and empower them.” ROOF, an annual event, is used to reach out to those in needs; widows, orphans, and the Down syndrome children, blind, physically challenge and others in the society.
