The new environmentally-friendly high capacity buses, which are now arriving the state in batches, were also equipped with modern facilities to bring about comfort and seamless travelling experience along the dedicated routes, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has said. Under the Bus Reform Initiative, 5,000 new buses are expected to be added to the public transport system, while other components of the scheme such as modern bus terminals, bus depots, bus stops and segregated laybys are already springing up in strategic locations across the State. This is aside the Intelligent Transport System mechanism of the initiative which will aid Lagosians to plan their journeys. Also, arrangement is also being firmed up as part of the short-term plan for the buses to be assembled in Lagos, which would in turn create jobs for the people, and as well serve to properly maintain the buses. Giving rationale behind the initiative, Ambode said the new buses and terminals were conceived to redefine public transportation in the state with the view to make the State globally competitive. He said: “Like we have said, we are doing bus terminals to actually improve on the management of transportation in the city. Some people would have noticed that we are beginning to receive some of our new buses. We have actually ordered 820 buses and we believe that by end of September, the 820 buses should be in Lagos. “The intention is not to drive away Danfo buses (Commercial Buses). Buses in Lagos right now are never enough. Government is intending to inject 5,000 but we do not intend to operate them and so whoever is going to operate the buses would recruit drivers and personnel to work on those buses. “So, if somebody upgrades from Danfo to bus, that is more job for our people. We, as government, are not the ones to drive the buses but what we are doing is to create avenue for people to get employed and to also create greater aesthetics for the city.”
