Following a picture of himself, his ex-wife actress Doris Simeon and their son taken at an eatery in Manhattan, New York, surfaced online recently, filmmaker Daniel Ademinokan has told fans not to believe everything they read online. The filmmaker who is now married to actress Stella Damasus had posted the viral picture himself, perhaps to indicate that he and Doris are co-parenting their only child together. He however warned: “Don’t believe everything you read on blogs. They’ve gotta stay sensational to make a dollar. It’s all good in the Hood,” saying, “Spent the entire weekend buried in a studio editing but I had to come up for air for this.” Simeon also took to Instagram to express her joy in seeing her son, who has been in custody of his father since the couple separated in 2010. “My love, my only source of joy, I miss you so much my baby and I love you forever, love of my life,” she said, adding: “Good to see you my finest little man.”
