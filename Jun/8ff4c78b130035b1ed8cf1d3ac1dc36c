Aggrieved members of the All Progressives ( APC) in the new People’s Democratic Party (nPDP) fold have denied planning to boycott the APC national convention slated for Saturday this week. The members said they will attend and participate fully in the party’s convention. In a statement by his media office in Ilorin, the Kwara state capital, Leader of the nPDP Alhaji Abubakar Baraje has said. Baraje who had been leading other members of nPDP in their consultations with APC leadership returned from Saudi Arabia where he had gone to perform the lesser Hajj on Wednesday. He emphasised that his group has no cause not to attend the convention. “We are looking forward to the Saturday convention, we will be at the convention and after that, we shall see how things unfold,” he declared. Reacting to various issues, statements, reactions and counter reactions about the claims in some media that President Muhammadu Buhari is not interested in meeting with the members of the nPDP, Baraje said though, he was not privy to such statement if at all it was true, but disclosed that the group or himself as the leader of the group, would not officially react now. He explained that when it is necessary for the presidency to invite them for discussion, talk or dialogue, they will invite the group as they are also waiting. On allegations that names of some people not in the fold of the mainstream APC in Kwara state were included as part of members of the Convention Committee of the party, Baraje said he was not aware of such development, and that he or any member of his group had not been briefed either by the presidency, the party leadership or the chairman of the convention committee of the nomination of such names. However, he said if such thing happened, it would be part of the issues to be raised at the eventual meeting with the presidency when such meeting is called.
