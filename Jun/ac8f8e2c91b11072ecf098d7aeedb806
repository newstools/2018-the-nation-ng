Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce has been added to the women’s 100m line-up for Saturday’s (9 June) JN Racers Grand Prix, set for the National Stadium in Kingston. Fraser-Pryce, who ran 11.33 at last weekend’s Cayman Invitational (2 June), her first international race in over a year since giving birth, will face a strong field. The Beijing 2008 and London 2012 Olympic 100m champion will face World champion Tori Bowie of the United States. Briana Williams, Jamaica’s U17 Carifta Games sprint double champion, was also recently added to the field. Several other international track and field stars, including Yohan Blake, Shaunae Miller-Uibo, Shericka Jackson and Aries Merritt, are down for the event.
