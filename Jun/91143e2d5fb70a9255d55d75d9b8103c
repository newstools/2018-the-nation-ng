US-based Non governmental organisation, Dream Project for Africa is set to enroll five more Nigerian children ages 5 to 12, from poor families across Nigeria into its academic scholarship program to the university level. The founder of the organization, Mr. Oluwabukola Michael Nelson, shared the news in a press release on May 30, 2018. Nelson disclosed that the scholarship expansion was necessary because of the success recorded since the launch of the program in 2016.
According to him, Dream Project will explore relevant partnerships to facilitate the planned expansion. Nelson explained that Dream Project will work with community influencers of integrity willing and able to partner with his team. He also expressed interest in partnering with standard British and American curriculum schools where #NoChildLeftBehind beneficiaries would be placed.
“We have seen the transformative power of our initiatives and are committed to making sure that #NoChildLeftBehind helps bring the dreams of many Nigerians alive!”, Michael announced in a statement via Twitter (@dpforafrica). Dream Project for Africa relentlessly advocates on behalf of oppressed Africans and creates programs to educate them on their rights. It promotes awareness of existing laws that could be enforced to help clear the path for Africans to achieve their dreams. Dream Project also partners with youths, participates in nation-building programs, and conducts research on democratic avenues for change.
