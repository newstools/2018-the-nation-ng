The Minister of State, Industry, Trade and Investment, Hajia Aisha Abubakar has decried the low production capacity of all the cotton producing companies in the country despite the different reforms initiated. The minister, who disclosed this during a media chat in Abuja, stated that the current administration at inception was determined to revitalise the textile industries as part of its campaign promises by visiting the different textile factories in Lagos, Zaria, Kaduna and Kano. However, she lamented that the ministry discovered abysmal level of growth with regards to production capacity. “The significance of the textile industry and its impact on the collapse on the nation’s economy is best illustrated by the fact that, at its height, the sector had created over 800,000 jobs, representing 25% of the total number of jobs in the manufacturing sector, second only to the government in the employment of labor. Also, there were 175 textile mills in the country during its golden era, (i.e. 1985 – 1991) out of which today, all but 27 of them have since gone under. In an attempt to understand the sector and the many challenges it faced, we traversed, held exhibitions, and had several but endless meetings.  We even met and held extensive talks or rubbing of minds with a broad spectrum of members and leadership of the textile labour union.” She stressed that other impediments hindering greater speed in the actualisation of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s blue print of action in the textile sector include the troubling phenomena of counterfeiting and smuggled textile materials especially from China.
