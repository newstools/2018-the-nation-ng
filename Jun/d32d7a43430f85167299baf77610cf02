A Federal High Court in Abuja on Monday fixed July 2 for ruling on a fundamental rights enforcement suit filed by former National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki. Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu chose the date after listening to arguments from lawyers representing the parties. Dasuki’s counsel, Ahmed Raji (SAN), argued that his client has been unlawfully held in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS) for about three years. He contended that despite a judgment by the Community Court of Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) ordering the immediate release of his client, the Federal Government has refused to obey the decision. He said: “When bail was granted to the applicant and he was re-arrested, proceedings were initiated to prohibit the prosecution from further prosecuting the matter. “This was fought up to the Supreme Court. The apex court gave its judgment on March 2 and said the Economic and Financial Crimes (EFCC) is the one prosecution and since the DSS, which is detaining him is not the one prosecuting, we should then go after the DSS, which is why we are here. “We went to international court, ECOWAS Court, they said its decision is only advisory and not binding,” Raji said. He prayed the court to grant his client’s prayers and restore his liberty. Lawyer to the DSS and its Director General, Lawal Daura, O. J. Odu urged the court to dismiss the application because it was an abuse of court process.
