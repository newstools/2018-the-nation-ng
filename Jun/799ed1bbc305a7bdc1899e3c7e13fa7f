Stats, stats, stats All six of Nigeria’s wins at the World Cup have come against European opposition, and they have kept a clean sheet in five of those six victories. This was Iceland’s first ever defeat in a group stage match at a major international tournament (Euros and World Cup), having previously drawn three and won one of four such games. Nigeria’s Francis Uzoho is the second youngest goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup match (19 years, 237 days), behind only Li Chan-Myong in North Korea’s 1-0 win over Italy in July 1966 (19 years, 198 days).
