A 38-year-old driver, who allegedly stole from his employers’ cash and valuables worth N5.4 million, was
on Friday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. The accused is standing trial on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. Police Prosecutor Benson Emuerhi told the court the accused committed the offences with others still at large on June 21 at Maryland,
Ikeja. Emuerhi said the accused, who worked as a driver for the complainant, Mrs Ngozi Braide, allegedly stole gold jewellery and cash
valued at N5.4 milion. He alleged that the accused was given the keys to the complainant’s house to grant access to the people who were coming to clean
the house. “Braide gave Phillip the keys to her apartment so he could let the housekeepers have access to her apartment but when she got
home, she noticed some of her property were missing. “The items stolen includes a 22 karat gold bangle, 22 karat chain, a set of diamond rings all valued at N3.6 million and 3,000 dollars
(N1.8 million). “The accused, who had been working for the complainant for over three years, broke into her room and made away with the items. “He was, however, apprehended by the police,” Emuerhi said. The offences contravened Sections 287 (&) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Section 287 (7) stipulates seven years jail term for offenders, while Section 411 provides
two years. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. In her ruling, Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat granted the accused bail of N250, 000 with two responsible sureties in like sum. Sule-Amzat said one of the sureties should be a blood relation of the accused and must be gainfully employed with an evidence of two
years tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The magistrate adjourned the case until Oct. 25 for trial. NAN
