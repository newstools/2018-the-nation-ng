Two presidential aspirants on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and a former Minister of Special Duties, Alhaji Tanimu Turaki, have knocked the Federal Government over Sunday’s mass killing of Plateau villagers In separate interviews yesterday in Abuja, the two politicians blamed the security approach adopted by the Federal Government in the management of the crisis. Describing the killings as unfortunate Atiku said: “It is not every security breach you use hard power on. You need to establish dialogue between leadership of various communities that lived together over the years. “So the issue of using mere crude and hard power is not the only solution. There is also the need to use soft power on the issue of peaceful coexistence among communities”. On his part, Turaki, blamed the killings on the failure of the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government for failing to address security lapses across the country. Turaki said: “If you recall, a few months ago, the National Security Agency had appeared before the Senate and disclosed that the greatest problem that the Nigeria security agencies have today is that the agencies work at cross purposes. “There is no cooperation, there is no synergy. If critical security agencies are not sharing information or working together, then how do you expect them to come up with tight security architecture that will safeguard the lives and properties of Nigerians? And that is what is happening”. Turaki, however, expressed the confidence that the PDP had all it takes to reclaim the leadership of the country in 2019 and return the country to a path of growth and prosperity. He said: “The PDP has men and women of impeccable integrity. Men and women that are known to be bridge builders, that have the needed education and experience. That is why we say PDP is different from every other political party in the country.
