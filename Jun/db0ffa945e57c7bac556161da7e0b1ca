The Vice Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University Ile ife, Prof Eyitope Ogunbodede has said the varsity has the best ICT Facility in the country. Prof Eyitope stated this during the Matriculation ceremony for the new 2017/2018 academic session held on Tuesday. The VC also congratulated the newly matriculated students, saying that they are  lucky to be admitted into the varsity. “Self management and strategies must be applied and you should have the ideas and must be creative to move the varsity forward,” he said, “This varsity is known for learning and culture so anyone caught fighting will be expelled. The school has zero tolerance for cultism, exam malpractice, sexual harassment, anti social behaviour amongst other ills of the society as the school would not condone any of us this from any student”. He further admonished the students to beware of friends that will lure them into bad behaviour and all forms of anti social behaviours that will interrupt their academic session.
