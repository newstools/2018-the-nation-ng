The Super Eagles finished their pre-World Cup friendlies with three defeats, losing to European opponents Serbia, England and Czech Republic. Losing 1-0 in Wednesday friendly was a big blow to Gernot Rohr’s men as it meant they will be lacking confidence before their World Cup opener against Croatia next week. Super Eagles captain Obi Mikel has revealed that their latest defeat was due to two factors : the inclement weather during the game and the long journey from their training camp in Bad Tatzmannsdorf to Schwechat. German-based Nigerian journalist Oma Akatugba, who spoke to Mikel, told allnigeriasoccer.com: ”Mikel complained about the long trip to the stadium and the bad weather. It took them one and half hours before they got to the match venue.” The Super Eagles trained on Thursday morning and in the evening, those who started Thursday’s game had a workout on the side while the rest of the players trained normally and ended the session with a practice game. Kelechi Iheanacho, Kenneth Omeruo, Ahmed Musa and Eddy Onazi were the outstanding players on Friday morning session.
