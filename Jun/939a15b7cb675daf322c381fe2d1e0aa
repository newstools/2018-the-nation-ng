A state High Court sitting in Ado-Ekiti on Friday  sentenced one Segun Afolayan to death by hanging for armed robbery. The 22-year- old bagged the sentence for  the offence which he committed on Nov.10, 2014 at Ado central area of Ado Ekiti. The convict had robbed one Ibrahim Samodun of a  Bajaj motorcycle with registration number  ADK 792 QC, cash of  N60,500, a Bold 5 blackberry phone valued at N35,000 and a Nokia 2700 valued at N15,000. Afolayan, who was armed with dangerous  weapons such as axe and a  gun,  was also charged  with stealing N50,000 from Layiwola Adeawo, another victim, on the same day. Nemesis, however, caught up with the convict   when the complainant, Samodun, discovered his motorcycle at Ijato area of Ado Ekiti. Samodun reported the discovery to the  police, leading to the arrest of  the convict and an accomplice, Eniola Sunday, who escaped during a jail break in Ado Ekiti.‎ The State Counsel, Mrs Ibironke Odetola, called two witnesses,  including the Investigating Police Officer,  Insp  Folashade Abe, who tendered some  exhibits. The exhibits included the confessional statements of the accused person, the  statement  of the complainant as well as  the pictures of the accused taken with the stolen motorcycle. The convict was represented by Mr Christopher Omokafe. Justice Abiodun Adesodun  held that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and consequently sentenced the convict to death by hanging.
