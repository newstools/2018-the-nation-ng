THE National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) has announced plans to collaborate with the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) in the area of distribution of electric meters. Executive Vice Chairman (EVC) NASENI Prof. Mohammed Haruna, said the agency had been doing researches on meters and would be collaborating with NERC for a way forward. According to him, metres found in the country are of different models and from different countries, with no standardisation. The NASENI EVC, who spoke in Abuja after his second tenure inauguration, said a solution will be found with the collaboration. He said he is determined to put everything that happened behind him and focus on things that would move the agency forward. Before the renewal of his tenure by President Muhammadu Buhari, a row broke out in the agency, which created a crisis of confidence among top directors and workers. His words: “The most important thing that we are starting with now that I am back in office is accommodating everybody, putting all that happened behind us and focusing on things that will move the agency forward for the benefit of the nation. “We are determined more than ever to get new products that will solve the economic and social problems affecting the country and things that will benefit the general public and that will transform rural areas for the progress of the country. That is our main mission.” NASENI Director, Technology Business Development Nathan Pawa, said the management was happy to have him back.
