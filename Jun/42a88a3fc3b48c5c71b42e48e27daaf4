 It would be recall that Dan- Ali had after  National Security  meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari   called for the suspension of  Anti- Open Grazing Prohibition Laws in Benue , Taraba and Ekiti states .  The groups said even if the law was to be  suspended,  it has to come through legislation and not  as  the Defence Minister has announced on pages of newspapers because the process of enacting the  law passed through due process by the House of Assembly. They described the statement by the Minster of Defence as unfortunate, coming shortly after a supposed National Security Council Meeting chaired by President Muhammadu Buhari. The group said they are shocked that a Minister of Defence  of a multilingual country like Nigeria would be making utterances that smacks of sinister motives on an issue that is testing the unity of the country. The statement further queried the rational behind  the Minister of Defence given protection to Herdsmen but have not found a lasting solution to harmless farmers who have been killed and their farm lands and house occupied by fulani militia. According to the tribal leaders , utterances of  Mansur- Dan Ali are the very reason why the killing of innocents farmers continued unabated .
