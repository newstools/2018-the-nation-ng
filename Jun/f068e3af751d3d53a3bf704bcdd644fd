Marketers yesterday expressed concern over the alleged disruption of loading at Ejigbo Satellite Depot by Pipelines Products Marketing Company (PPMC). They claimed that PPMC has not allowed loading in the last three weeks. Chairman of Ejigbo Satellite depot Alhaji Ayo Alanamu, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), that the action would cause fuel scarcity within the metropolis, if not addressed urgently. According to Alanamu, an official of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) explained that routine maintenance was being carried out on system 2B pipeline network, which was yet to be completed. “The official said non-payment of salary to the pipelines surveillance security affected the pumping of products to the depot as the security demanded for payment before operation can commence. “We have not loaded a single product from the depot in the last three weeks and this has increased the ex-depot price in most private depots in Apapa,” he said. The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) boss urged the NNPC to intervene to avert scarcity management before weekend. “Today, the situation has worsened as Mosinmi and Ibadan depots now have low stock. The two depots which usually load 200 trucks each on a daily basis now load between 10 to 12 trucks daily,” he said. He said marketers would not hesitate to sell petrol above the N145 per litre pump price, if private depots failed to sell at the official ex-depot price. Alanamu said it was a challenge for trucks coming from Kwara, Ilorin, Ekiti, and Kogi to load at Apapa due to the ongoing road repairs.
