However, following a contrition on the part of the student, the Vice Chancellor according to his  Media Assistant, Sunday Saanu in a facebook post graciously forwarded his case to the Council for reconsideration and forgiveness where Anyanwu was told to go and sin no more. He has since been allowed to resume his studies with effect from the beginning of this current 2017/18 academic session . Speaking on the development recently, the VC, Prof. Olayinka asserted that his administration was not ready to jeopardize the future of any student by expulsion, but added “yet, we have the responsibilities to instill character and learning in them” “We are in loco parentis expected to process them for the ultimate use of the society. A 100 level student is still raw and green. We take some of these insult and embarrassment in our stride in order to ensure that they have a rosy future. But we will not hesitate to wield a big stick for anyone considered to be incorrigible because the certificate going out from UI must be based on sound character and learning ” said the VC. However, the Vice Chancellor  warned that the fact that his administration was lenient shouldn’t embolden any student to be rude, pointing out that a 400 level student in Anyanwu’s situation may not have been so lucky because that is considered a mature level.
