An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos yesterday sentenced a make-up artist, Tunde Ebikeme, to community service for stealing beauty products valued at N15,000 from a supermarket. Magistrate M. O. Ope-Agbe convicted Ebikeme, 24, following his plea of guilty to a one-count charge of stealing. She ordered him to sweep the court’s premises from the fourth floor to the ground floor. The magistrate said the convict got only community service as punishment because he had a good skill which he needed to sharpen. Mrs Ope-Agbe warned Ebikeme against committing a crime because he could be sent to prison the next time.
