Three persons have been reportedly killed in renewed clashes between rival cult groups in Eket Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State. It was gathered that the bloody supremacy battle between members of the Vikings Confraternity and the Black Axe started last Sunday at a motel in the Afaha Uqua axis of the oil-rich city. A source, who pleaded not to be named, said the two groups had been at each other’s throat for three months, following squabbles not unconnected with power struggle. According to the source, one suspected cultist was killed on Liverpool Road and the second in Uqua village, while the third was killed at a point in Atai Ndon village in Eket Local Government Area. “The present clash leading to the death of three started on Sunday when a member of Vikings Confraternity unleashed terror on a member of the Black Axe with machete cuts,” the source said. He added that two friends in rival confraternities were at the motel on Afaha Uqua Road when members of the Vikings allegedly attacked them. The friends reportedly attacked a member of Black Axe who had attempted to defend his Viking friend. He said the Black Axe Confraternity member was macheted to death. According to him, the two cult groups have been fighting, which led to the death of the three persons and injury to several others. Police spokesman MacDon Achebe, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the command was on top of the situation. He added: “The police will not tolerate any act that will lead to breakdown of law and order in the state. “The Akwa Ibom State Police Command is calling all those who are directly or indirectly connected with criminality to desist. Otherwise, the full wrath of the law will be visited on perpetuators.” He said the laws proscribing cultism and “gangsterism” was still in place, adding that the command would ensure that nobody takes the law into his or her hands.
