A 35-year-old woman, Jumoke Adesida, has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping a two-year-old girl in Lagos. The incident occurred on June 22 at 12, Kazeem Adeboye Street, Jerry Farm, Odogunyan, Ikorodu, Lagos. It was gathered that Adesida, a resident of Odo-Kekere village in Ogun State, allegedly stole the child because she was lonely and needed someone to play with. The woman kidnapped the kid, Rokibat Raji, at her mother’s shop. The police said the victim’s mother, Aminat Abidoye, 38, had reported the disappearance of her child at Shagamu-Road Division, prompting the state Commissioner of Police, Imohimi Edgal, to direct the Anti-Kidnapping unit to handle the matter. Confirming the incident, Edgal told journalists that the unit tapped into the robust community policing structure to look for the victim. He said: “Their efforts paid off as the missing child was traced to Jumoke Adesida, 35, in Odo-Kekere Village, Ogun State. During interrogation, Adesida confessed to the crime. She explained that she needed the child to play with as her husband has taken her only child away from her. “The suspect would be charged to court as soon as investigation is concluded.” Similarly, five suspects – Owen Onazurulike (21), Patrick Modupe (41), Chika Amadi (31), Kabiru Azeez (31) and Jamiu Jimoh (41) were arrested at Iju for allegedly kidnapping one Murtala Babarabe. They reportedly whisked the victim from Shoprite, Alausa to Iju-Ishaga, where men suspected to be members of the Oodua Peoples’ Congress (OPC), subjected him to trial by ordeal and extortion. It was gathered that policemen attached to Iju Division were alerted and they rescued the victim. According to Edgal, an unregistered Toyota Camry was recovered from the suspects.
