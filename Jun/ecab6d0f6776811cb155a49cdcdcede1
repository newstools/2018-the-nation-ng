The loss of a loved one brings a certain sadness that cannot be explained, except experienced. Comforting words such as “It is well”, “Take heart”, “Call me if you need anything” are commonly used to console the bereaved. It’s more disheartening when a woman loses her partner and becomes a widow, who has to deal with hardship, discrimination, and life without her husband. Lipton understands that Widows are mothers who care for others, but have little or no one to care for them. In partnership with Hope For Life Initiative and God’s Wives, Lipton will give widows reasons to smile by empowering them with seed capital to start their own businesses and give them care packs. The best part is, You can join us too! Buy a pack of Lipton. Every pack you buy between May 1st and June 16th will go towards helping Lipton give 1000 care packs, and seed capital. So go ahead and be a part of #LiptonReasonsToSmile #ThinkLessDoMore
