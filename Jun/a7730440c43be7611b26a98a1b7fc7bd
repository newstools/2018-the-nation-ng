Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute (ARMTI) Executive Director, Dr Olufemi Oladunni, has called for bio-security audits to prevent exports rejections and boost the integrity of the nation’s food production system. He said trade was important to the future of Nigeria’s farmers, adding that such audits helps to determine the level of application of bio-security, one of the most crucial requirements to keep diseases out of farms. He explained that customers’ confidence in the nation’s exports underpins the success and growth of the food sector. Bio-security is a set of preventive measures such as movement control, cleaning, disinfection and vaccination to prevent disease introduction and spread. By implementing strict bio-security, farm owners decrease risk of disease incursion carried by people, animals, vehicles and equipment to their farms. Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) recommends strict application of bios-ecurity measures as it is the most effective way to prevent and control viruses spreading along the production chain as well as potential transmission to humans. Bio-security is a key requirement for achieving the goals set out in the FAO strategic framework by promoting, developing and re-enforcing policy and regulatory frameworks for food, agriculture, fisheries, and forestry.
