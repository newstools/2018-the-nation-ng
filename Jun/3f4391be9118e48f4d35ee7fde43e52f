A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, Ayoade Afolabi Lawal, has pledged to industrialise the state, if elected in this year’s election. Addressing his teeming supporters during his declaration to run for governorship at the party’s secretariat on Gbongan Road in Osogbo, the state capital, Lawal promised to continue from where the Rauf Aregbesola administration will stop. He also pledged to prioritise youth empowerment and provide necessary support for the vulnerable, including women, children and the aged. Lawal, a chemical engineer and business mogul, hailed Aregbesola for laying a solid foundation for the incoming administration to build upon. He said: “But for all-round sustainable development, industrial development should take precedence henceforth. This is the way to complement what has been achieved and to deepen the recent gains of democratic governance. “My administration shall create a value chain industrialisation, which will be all-inclusive, and no son and daughter of Osun will be left out in the scheme…”
