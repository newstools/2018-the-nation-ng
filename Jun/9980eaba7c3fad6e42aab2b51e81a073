Janne Andersson has confessed that Sweden must “be more effective” in their remaining Group F matches if they are to progress into the last 16 of the World Cup. The Blue-Yellow carved out a 1-0 win against South Korea in their opening match on Monday afternoon, courtesy of a VAR-awarded penalty from Andreas Granqvist. Sweden created the better chances in Nizhny Novgorod and were good value for their three-point haul, but Andersson admits that his side should have done more from their handful of openings, with champions Germany – beaten by Mexico in their opener – up next on Saturday. “We created many chances and I’m confident that we can be more effective in the coming matches,” he told reporters. “Definitively, the best player of Korea Republic today was their goalkeeper. “After Germany’s defeat yesterday this win can possibly be even more important.” Sweden joins Mexico on three points at the top of the Group F standings after the first set of matches.
