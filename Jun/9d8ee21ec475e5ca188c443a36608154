Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode yesterday urged civil servants to  embrace quality improvement in the public service, to sustain the change mantra of the present administration. Speaking at a two-day training in Ikeja, Ambode said the use of the word change as a political slogan or mantra was extensive, especially during the electioneering campaigns. He stressed the need to ensure that workers were trained and retrained to fit into the act of change mantra and  make them part of the civil servants who would form the bedrock upon which change would revolve. “Change became a clarion call for bold action and monumental shifts in governing style, a fundamental repudiation of the previous eight years. The use of the word change as a political slogan or mantra was extensive in the 2015 general election. We had a fair share of it. The concern, however, is that mantras and slogans are not easily converted into concrete actions.” The governor, represented by the Commissioner for Establishments, Training and Pensions, Dr Benson Oke, said the present administration since inception in 2015 had been mindful of avoiding the pitfall, hence the support received by the Ministry of Establishments, Training and Pensions to ensure it organised training and workshop to concretise and convert the change mantra into a meaningful and sustainable change in the civil service.” Ambode said the present administration realised that to achieve change, a commitment to the mission was necessary.
