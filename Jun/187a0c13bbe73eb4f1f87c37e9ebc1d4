The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has dscribed the Presidential action on Chief MKO Abiola and the receognitionof June 12 as Democracy Day as smacking of hypocrisy and political desperation. It said President Buhari’s action merely sought to use the name and person of Abiola to gain a political capital and not out of genuine reverence and recognition for him. PDP spokesman Kola Ologbondiyan said President Buhari, who was serving in the military administration of General Sani Abacha during the travails of Abiola, did not associate either by words or actions with the presumed winner of June 12 election. Ologbondiyan said history did not record President Buha as sympathetic to the Abiola’s family when his wife, Kudirat, was gruesomely murdered by the agents of the Abacha government. He said, “It is, therefore, a sign of political desperation for President Buhari to seek to use Chief Abiola’s name as a tool to sway Nigerians in less than 12 months to an election where he, (President Buhari) is seeking a second term.
