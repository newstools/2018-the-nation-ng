Lagos States Government yesterday served a seven-day notice on owners/occupiers of illegal structures and containerised shops around Abattoir and Oko-Oba in Agege to remove them forthwith. Chairman of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP), said over 2500 illegal structures including containerised shops were served ‘removal order’ within abattoir and Fagba by railway side, Agege. The shanties, he said, were occupied by miscreants and hoodlums who terrorise people. He said: “It is an eye-sore with miscreants and hoodlums freely smoking and selling Indian hemp including prostitution by underage boys and girls around the area” Oko-Oba railway line including Estate, he said, could no longer sleep with their eyes closed because of the miscreants.
