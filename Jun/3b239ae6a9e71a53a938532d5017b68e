The University of Lagos (UNILAG) fact finding panel on the allegation of sexual harassment involving a lecturer of the University has put out a call for memoranda to both students and staff to submit information they have on the allegation of sexual harassment against Prof Segun Awonusi of the English Department between June 11 and 15. Though Awonusi, a former Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology in Ogun State and Vice-Chancellor, Tai Solarin University of Education, Ijagun, Ogun State, was not named in the notice published by the panel, his nude photograph was shared on the social media by an unnamed student who complained about the lecturer in a post published by popular blogger, Linda Ikeji. The notice directed workers and students responding to the call to enclose the memoranda in sealed envelopes and submit to the Registrar’s office for onward delivery to the panel within the stipulated time frame. It added that the university had zero tolerance for “such allegations”.
