The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) on Friday in Abuja unveiled its 2018 annual general conference logo and website with a charge to lawyers to leverage on the conference to ensure the success of the 2019 elections. Unveiling the logo, the NBA President, Mr Abubakar Mahmoud (SAN), said the 2018 conference would evolve solutions to address the current and contemporary issues affecting the country. Mahmoud also said that the theme for the 2018 conference, “Transition, Transmission and Sustainable Institutions”, was apt considering that the country was preparing for elections in 2019. “Last year’s conference had the theme “African Business: Penetrating through Institution Building”, so we are building on the theme of last year. “We are, however, trying to address the more current and more contemporary issues of transition and transformation and we are not only focusing on local transformation but global trends,” he said. Mahmoud said that they were expecting over 10,000 lawyers to attend the conference and urged lawyers to log onto the website and register, adding that registration would only be via online. Mr George Etomi, Chairman, Technical Committee for the Conference Planning, said the NBA’s annual conference was the largest gathering of lawyers in the world. Etomi said that they gathered to play a pivotal role in reshaping and reforming the nation by analysing burning issues and evolving possible solutions. He noted that the theme for the 2018 conference was carefully chosen to afford lawyers the opportunity to x-ray their role in the country and on the continent as a whole. According to him, being the penultimate electioneering year, the conference will afford lawyers the opportunity to set an agenda to help the country achieve successful elections. He said that  Ghanian President, Mr Nana Akufo-Addo is expected to give the keynote address at the conference which would hold from Aug. 26 to Aug. 30 in Abuja. NAN
