The Nigerian Society of Engineers (NSE) President, Mr Kunle Mokuolu, has called on the Federal Government to provide proper framework that would ensure better housing delivery for Nigerians. To achieve this, Mokuolu wants the Federal Government to create the enabling environment for private sector initiative and to engage more private sector participants in its mass housing drive. He noted that housing delivery in developed countries fared better because they are run by the private sector. The NSE boss, who expressed reservations about government’s disposition so far to the housing sector, argued that housing should be off the hands of government, be completely privatised, while government should provide the policy and laws that would back housing delivery. Mokuolu urged government to concern itself with social housing for those who cannot pay rent because they were either out of job or had other financial handicap. He advised that social housing should be restricted to the local government level and that when such economically disadvantaged citizens found their financial footing, they could start to pay rent or buy homes. “Federal Government is to provide the framework to ease the delivery of housing. I am not really satisfied with the housing delivery, some things must be in place to achieve this. “We must begin to produce our steel ourselves and that is why Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Mill is too important. Whatever it takes to produce steel in this country, government should just do it,” he said, adding that the steel component was important in developing high rise buildings, especially now that the nation’s population was growing geometrically. This will help to accommodate more people in less spaces or land. He expressed confidence that Ajaokuta Steel Rolling Mill could “substantially” reduce the housing deficit in the country given that steel accounted for about 25 per cent of the cost of construction of houses.
