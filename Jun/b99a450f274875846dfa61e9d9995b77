Popular comedian Gbenga Adeyinka has revealed that the late politician and ‘presumed winner’ of the June 12, 1993 elections, Chief Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola, known as MKO Abiola, will be honoured at this year’s ‘Laffmattazz With Gbenga Adeyinka 1st & Friends.’ The event which holds at D Dome, Akure, Ondo State, is tagged ‘The Invasion.’ Adeyinka said the comedy show which usually holds on public holidays like Easter Sundays, Sallah, among others chose June 12 because of its symbolism in Nigeria. “What we have done with Laffmattazz is to fix the dates on symbolic holidays like June 12, and we will be honouring Abiola at the show, which we usually do every year,” he said. The comedy show is aimed at building new generations of comedians and taking premium quality entertainment to hitherto overlooked places.
