The Nigeria Table Tennis Federation (NTTF) in a release on Friday said the organisation was saddened by the death of one of the national players – Seun Ajetunmobi. Ajetunmobi whose last duty for Nigeria was at the 2015 African Games in Congo Brazzaville, died early on June 1 following a domestic accident, which occurred at his Lagos home on May 23. He died yesterday at the hospital where he was receiving treatment. In a statement signed by the Secretary-General of NTTF, Idaye Anthony, the federation was shocked by the news of the 33-year-old promising star, who on May 9, was crowned the men’s singles champion at the annual Aso Championships held in Abuja. “On behalf of the President, the executive board members and the entire table tennis family in Nigeria, I regret to announce the sudden death of one of our National Team players – Seun Ajetunmobi, which sad event occurred early morning of June 1, 2018, in a Lagos hospital. The Italy-based athlete was on holiday in Nigeria after the end of the season in Italy. The federation sympathised with the player’s family and his supporters in Nigeria and around the World. The burial will be announced later by his family,” Idaye said. Prior to moving to Italy, Ajetunmobi had played in Portugal and was at a time, unbeaten for several years in Nigeria.
