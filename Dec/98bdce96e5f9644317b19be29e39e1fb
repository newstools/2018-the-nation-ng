The recent primaries conducted by political parties in Adamawa State led to 396 court cases and 52 petitions filed by aggrieved aspirants, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has disclosed. Speaking at a function in Yola, the state capital, the state electoral commissioner, Kassim Gaidam, spoke of “the present battle by the commission over 396 litigations and 52 petitions as fallout of party primaries held from August to October 2018,” and appealed to politicians to adhere to the rules of election to minimize dissents. “Without free, fair and credible elections, democracy cannot thrive in Nigeria,” Gaidam told the politicians who gathered at the Green City Hotel in Jimeta on Thursday to either sign or witness the signing of a peace accord meant to bind the 29 governorship candidates of the state to a peaceful conduct before, during and after the 2019 general elections. He said electoral malpractice must be avoided because it is dangerous as its effects could be worse than prompting court cases and petitions and could degenerate to violence by aggrieved people who do not have the means or patience to go to court or write petitions. He therefore reiterated the need for politicians to play the game by the rule during the 2019 general elections to minimize dissents and avoid litigations or violence.
