Stakeholders in education have advised the Lagos State Government to prioritise the Universal Basic Education (UBE) programme, in order to eradicate illiteracy. The stakeholders, who spoke yesterday in Abule-Egba, Lagos at a meeting convened by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Human Development Initiatives (HDI), said they were ready to partner the government to eradicate illiteracy. HDI’s  Programme Officer  Johnson Ibidapo, who coordinated the meeting, said: “We are ready to partner the government to eradicate illiteracy. It is sad that some children in the state, who are of school age, are not in school. According to statistics, the Southsouth geopolitical zone has the lowest rate of illiteracy. We want to ensure that illiteracy is eradicated in the Southwest, starting from Lagos State.” Ibidapo, who represented HDI’s Executive Director Mrs. Olufunso Owasanoye, said the government should ensure that all children were enrolled for the UBE programme, which covered education from primary school to junior secondary school. He said: “The government should achieve education for all by reducing the number of school dropouts and out-of-school children, improving quality and efficiency of basic education, promoting the acquisition of literacy, numeracy, life skills and values for lifelong education and useful living. “The UBE programme acknowledges education as a fundamental right of all school-age pupils, and therefore makes education from primary to junior secondary school free and compulsory.” Participants at the meeting included members of school-based management committees, parents’ forum, school managers, community development associations and committees.
