Star Lager Beer said it plans to round off the year in conjunction with the Lagos government at One Lagos Fiesta, scheduled for December 24 to January 1. The government said artistes cutting across all genres would be performing at the fiesta with support from Star Lager. The eight day celebration will hold in five different designated locations in Lagos simultaneously and will feature not just artistes but dance groups and cultural performances. Speaking on why the brand chose be at the event, the Brand Manager, Star Lager Beer, Onyebuchi Nwangwu, said the brewer is consumer-focused, and a listening brand. “We know how passionate Nigerians are about festivities and that is why we’re supporting One Lagos Fiesta. We share in this excitement and we will be pulling all the stops to ensure our consumers have a great time all through the eight days,” he said.
