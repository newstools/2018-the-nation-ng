The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) has warned against the sale of  the nation’s refineries. The workers promised to resist such move. Apparently reacting to a statement credited to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that promised to sell the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) if voted into power, PENGASSAN President, Francis Olabode Johnson,  said the proposeed sale of the refineries will not be accepted by the workers. He said instead of selling the refineries and the NNPC, efforts should be made to rehabilitate them. Johnson said: “We strongly appeal to the Federal Government to hasten work on the rehabilitation of the refineries as conflicting pronouncements are creating more confusion. We urge the government to fast-track the rehabilitation of the refineries as the proposed sale in certain quarters will not be accepted. “Our position has been that we want the Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas (NLNG) Model to be replicated in the refineries management.” Johnson who spoke at the Delegate Conference of the association, commended the NNPC management for its role in resolving the JV Cash Call issue; restoration of operations at depots in Mosimi, Ore, Aba, Gombe, Ibadan, Calabar, Ilorin, Kaduna and others. He said: “We will use this medium to sincerely appreciate the dedication and commitment of  NNPC management in their investment drive to position the corporation for greater efficiency.”
