A Group identified as the National Association of Akwa Ibom State Students ( NAAKISS ) has denied endorsing the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state, Dr Obong Nsima Ekere for the Akwa Ibom governorship seat in 2019. NAAKISS President, Comrade Aniefiok Edet in a press conference distanced the association from the purported endorsement of the All
Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate by a group called Supreme Council of Chapter President of NAAKISS Worldwide. “The attention of the 6th legislative Assembly of the National Association of Akwa Ibom State Students (NAAKISS WORLDWIDE) parliament has been drawn to the endorsement of the gubernatorial candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC)  in the person of His Excellency Obong Nsima Ekere by five renegades acting on fictitious and fraudulent platforms called Supreme Council of Chapter President of NAAKISS Worldwide. “There is nothing like Supreme Council of Chapter Presidents in the entire constitution of NAAKISS Worldwide, thus any purported decision
of the said platform remains criminal, null and void and of no effect whatsoever,” he added. Edet, who stated that the constitution of the association, does not recognize the existence of supreme council of chapter president, said
that the decision by the platform remains “null and void, and of no effect.” The student body also said it would mobilize its members across the country to resist any further invasion of the State House of Assembly. It condemned the recent onslaught on the assembly by suspected hoodlums following the crisis between All Progressives Congress (APC)
and Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) lawmakers, said it was sad that Nigeria’s democracy was being threatened. “The leadership of NAAKISS has condemned in the strongest term possible, the breach of the rule of law as perpetuated by the five constitutionally and lawfully sacked members of the Akwa Ibom State House of Assembly and the criminal partnership of the Nigeria Police
Force which is seriously threatening the subsistent peace in the state. “There is every indication that the APC in the country are resolved to plunge Nigeria to a lawless society, as evidence in, the invasion of
the Senate of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and carting away of themace by an APC senator,” he said.
