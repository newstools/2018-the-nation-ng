The General Superintendent of the Deeper Life Bible Church Worldwide, Pastor Williams Kumuyi, on Wednesday urged Auditors-General to embrace the sterling quality of integrity as it plays a critical role in carrying out their onerous responsibilities. He explained that integrity, perhaps, is the most important principle of leadership. According to him, “Auditors write reports which are to be relied upon by members of the public. It follows, therefore, that such reports must be truthful and honest; because integrity requires telling the truth, even if the truth is ugly. “It is better to be honest than to delude others. This quality is so important that the Almighty God Himself demanded and acknowledged it in the Holy Scriptures.” Kumuyi who made this known in his paper titled: “Integrity: an indispensable quality required of the nation’s auditors-general”, at the annual conference of Auditors-General in Abuja stressed that “the straightest, surest path to respect and confidence and success is through honesty and truthfulness, and the straightest, shortest path to failure is through falsehood.” “Habitual truthfulness is a bright and shining quality we should all possess. It grants strength in the path of duty and leads to the most enduring success. “Without this virtue, there is no reliance on spoken or written reports, no confidence in men of authority and power, no security in pledges and oaths. “Truth is always consistent with itself and needs nothing to help it out. Falsehood is dangerous and humiliating,” he said. Abundant blessings, preservation of our audit Institutions and the nation, blessings for our children, firmly established nation, divine guidance for our auditors and the nation, confidence and assurance, according to Pastor Kumuyi are some of the benefits derivable from integrity.
