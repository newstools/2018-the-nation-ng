The withdrawal of $1.68 billion from the Excess Crude Account (ECA) in one month by the Federal Government  has left a balance of $631 million in the strategic Excess Crude Account as at December 19, it was learnt yesterday . The ECA is a buffer account held in trust by the government to cushion the effects of economic volatilities during hard times. However, the Federal Government said it swept the account of 72.7 per cent of the original savings to off-set the last tranche of the Paris Club obligations to states. Addressing reporters at the end of the monthly Federation Account Allocation Committee (FAAC) meeting in Abuja yesterday, Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Finance, Dr. Mahmoud Isa Dutse, disclosed the balance in the ECA as $631 million. When asked to clarify the figures, Dutse maintained that the balance in the ECA was  $631 million. “The balance in the ECA is $631 million. The final payment for Paris Club refund to states was made and the figure was deducted and that’s what accounts for the difference.” Asked him if money “from the ECA to settle Paris Club refunds?”, the permanent secretary responded: “A decision was taken to make this refund and part of that decision is that the refund should be funded from the ECA. Federal Executive Council (FEC) and the president approved the money.” At the November FAAC meeting in Kaduna, what was declared to be left in the ECA was $2.319 billion but by last night the account had been depleted by 72.7per cent to $631 million.
