The police in Lagos have arrested popular musician Adekunle Temitope aka Small Doctor and three of his band members for alleged illegal possession of firearms. They were nabbed around Oshodi after threatening to shoot traffic policemen, Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal said yesterday. The commissioner, said to have paraded the suspects before few reporters who were at the command headquarters, frowned at the artiste’s conduct. He said he had a pending case at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba, Lagos. Edgal alleged that the musician opened fire at his show in Agege, which left four persons injured. He said: “You would have thought the incident would have made him to be wiser, but surprisingly today (yesterday), I got a situation report from traffic monitors on Oshodi Expressway alleging that four gunmen in green unregistered Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) threatened to shoot them. “He brought out a gun and threatened to shoot the policemen. Fortunately, the DPO and other policemen at Shogunle intercepted the suspects and arrested them. “When they were brought here, it was discovered that one of them was the same Adekunle Temitope aka Small Doctor with three others. They were arrested with a functional rifle, a cartridge and personal items. “I am concerned, as one will expect that a popular musician like him will be a role model, but his character is nothing to emulate.” The police boss urged celebrities to stop involving in activities that do not portray them well.
