Lovers of gospel movies will be thrilled this festive period during the theatrical release of Broken. Written by Mrs. Bola Akande, daughter of late ace film maker Ishola Ogunmola, popularly known as I Show Pepper, the movie will show at KS Cinema Total Garden Ibadan, G2G Cinema Ile-Ife and Clementine Cinema in Osapa, Lekki, Lagos on December 24-26th by 12pm, 3pm and 6pm. The train moves to Mauve 21 Ring Road, Ibadan; Adolak Hotel, Ore, Ondo; Continental Suites Ibara, Abeokuta; Ace Supermarket Owode, Oyo G2G Cinema in Ile-Ife & Silverbird Cinema, Abuja on December 26. Broken, according to the United Kingdom-based Akande, is the story of how a 12-year-old girl is constantly molested by a family member. Because incest is an abomination in her society, she keeps her pain quiet, all at the same time desperately striving to gain the love of her runaway father. But on her 17th birthday, Morenike decides to fight back with grave consequences. According to Akande, a Masters degree holder in film-making from the Manchester School of Arts: “Incest is a taboo in African culture, a topic that is hardly talked about, making it look as though it doesn’t happen. “Yet a large number of people are victims. Broken The Movie explores this topic from the point of view of a victim.”
