Three sales agents, Joe Obudu, Abodunrin Ibrahim and Ojo Taiye, were on Wednesday arraigned before an Ilorin Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly selling pre-registered SIM cards. The Prosecutor, Ajide Kehinde of Legal Department of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) told the court that the accused were arrested on Nov. 30. Kehinde said the arrest followed the information received from a member of staff of the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). According to an official of the NCC, Mr Fiefamotey Esinkuma, while on routine duty, it was discovered that the accused were dealing in pre-registered SIM cards which is against the NCC Act 2003. Esinkuma said the accused persons were selling illegal SIM cards to innocent people within Ilorin metropolis. The prosecutor said the accused were facing trial on a two-count charge of criminal conspiracy and dealing in illegal sales and use of pre-registered SIM cards. According to him, this contravened Sections 96 of Penal Code Law and 131(2) A of the Nigerian Communication Act, 2003. The accused persons, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. Kehinde prayed the court to adjourn the case to enable him prove the case against the accused. The Defence Counsel, Muhammed Balogun, prayed the court to exercise its bail discretion in favour of the accused, as the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria still presumed them innocent of the allegation until contrary is proved. The Magistrate, Mrs Mercy Adebola, admitted the accused to bail each at the sum of N50,000 and a surety in the same amount. She adjourned the case till January 24, 2019 for further mention. NAN
