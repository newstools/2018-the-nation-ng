•DSS invites ‘factional Speaker’ Uzoezie The Anambra State House of Assembly yesterday passed vote of confidence in the embattled Speaker Rita Maduagwu for her leadership qualities. Mrs Maduagwu, who was purportedly impeached on November 13 by some lawmakers for alleged high-handedness, financial impropriety, among others, resumed sitting yesterday with 20 lawmakers. But the session was not attended by factional Speaker Ikem Uzoezie, who The Nation gathered, was invited by the Department of State Services (DSS). During the sitting, the member representing Ayamelum Constituency, Uchenna Okafor, moved a motion, which was seconded by Lawrence Ezeudu, declaring support for Mrs Maduagwu. Some of the 30 lawmakers in the Assembly did not attend plenary to show their disapproval of the latest development. Deputy Speaker Hayford Oseke and some others, who hitherto teamed up with Uzoezie, showed their solidarity with Mrs Maduagwu. The member representing Anambra East Constituency, Obinna Emenaka, described the Speaker as a virtuous woman, whose character earned her the chairmanship of the Conference of Speakers in the Southeast. Also, Governor Willie Obiano will today present next year’s Appropriation Bill to the House of Assembly.
