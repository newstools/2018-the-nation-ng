Immediate implementation of the previous agreement mutually reached between it and Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) has been proffered by the House of Representatives as the panacea to checking incessant strikes in the nation’s ivory towers, the House of Representatives has said. The lawmakers expressed concern over the on-going strike action by members of ASUU, which has paralyzed academic activities of most public-owned universities and expressed dissatisfaction with the Presidency over its reluctance to transmit to the National Assembly the Tripartite Agreement on National Minimum Wage to the National Assembly. As a result, the lawmakers resolved that a joint ad hoc committee of  National Assembly be constituted to investigate the remote and immediate causes of Tuesday’s industrial action by members of the Parliamentary Staff Association of the National Assembly (PASAN) and make appropriate recommendations to the two legislative chambers for appropriate action. This followed the adoption of a motion of urgent national importance, Sani Zoro (APC, Jigawa), who noted that threats of industrial action by organized labour in the face of the stalemate was caused by the failure to facilitate the due process needed for appropriate resolution of the dispute. He said: ‘It is disturbing that members of the Parliamentary Staff Association of the National Assembly also picketed our two legislative chambers on Tuesday to draw attention to their grievances. “The looming industrial action threatened by organized labour, with the potential of paralyzing the nation’s socio-economic and political activities- and its attendant costs can be averted in consistence with National Assembly’s established tradition of intervention that have in the past helped to resolve many labour disputes”. The motion was unanimously passed after a vote.
