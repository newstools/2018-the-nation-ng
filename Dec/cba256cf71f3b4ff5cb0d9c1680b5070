The tournament which was bankrolled by Elegushi of Ikate Kingdom, Oba Saheed Ademola Elegushi, (Kusenla III) also afforded the patron of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) to reaffirm his commitment to sports development. To emerge as champions, it took Igbinovia and Falola two hours to conquer Jude Osaji and Ayo Laja in a pulsating final. The Blind Double tournament was organized to keep alive the legacies of the late Oba Yekini Adeniyi Elegushi, who was tennis player and enthusiast in his lifetime. With huge followership of tennis across the globe, Oba Elegushi stated that he would continue to lend his support to the sports with special attention to grassroots. “I decided to support this initiative; it is the first edition of the competition and from feelers on what has transpired on the courts here in the last one week, I think we will continue with this. We will ensure we have a bigger competition next year and include the younger generation because tennis is played across all ages and we must improve on what we have done this year”, Elegushi stated. 42 players competed in the one-week championship while trophy and medals were presented to the winners, runners up as well as other players who participated in the tournament. The well-attended event was witnessed by top political, businesses and community leaders which included former APC Legal Adviser, Dr Muiz Banire, Noheem Adams of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Special Adviser to the Lagos Governor on Central Business District, Anofi Elegushi, Jide Obanikoro among others.
