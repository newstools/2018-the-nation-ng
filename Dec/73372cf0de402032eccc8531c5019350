Nigerian writers will join their counterparts in other parts of the world to commemorate this year’s World Migration Day. In a statement made available to the press, the President of PEN international, Nigerian chapter Folu Agoi, said the association will on Tuesday December 18th organise readings, poetry performances and other literary events to identify with millions of people migrating from one region to the other due to economic, political, social, religious and other domestic problems in their home countries. This is one of the United Nations recognised days to draw attention to the plight of many disgruntled people. It is for this reason that PEN Nigeria is keen in using the occasion to bring nearer home  what is happening to milions of migrants through performances and literary presentations and more. Agoi said “PEN Nigeria is an affiliate of PEN International which means International Association of Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists, a worldwide association of writers.” “We are known to play leading roles in ppromoting literature as a force of global culture and defending freedom of  expression and linguistic rights across the globe. Therefore this is one of those moments in time for us to do our bit.’ The celebration in Nigeria will hold at the CORA headquarters at Surulere, Lagos by 1pm.”
