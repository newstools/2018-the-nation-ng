The Anambra State sector commander, Federal Road Safety Corps Mr Sunday Ajayi is dead. Ajayi was said to have died in an auto crash Saturday morning around Agbor, Delta State. According to sources, the Sector commander was on his way from Kwara state, where he attended a relation’s wedding. “He died on the highway leading to Agbor approaching Asaba the Delta state capital. A message from the Corps Whatsaap group in South East, said, “His driver, a senior marshal, Raji survived and is in the hospital but Sunday couldn’t make it. May his soul rest in peace. “Ajayi who participated in the FRSC football competition yesterday and handed over prizes was full of life before his untimely death.” The FRSC flag at the command headquarters in Awka, was seen lowered possibly as symbol of respect for his death. The command’s Public Relations Officer, Ufiem Egim confirmed the report, but said the command was yet to come up with a formal report detailing the cause of his death. It would be recalled that Ajayi had noted that speed was responsible for more than 50% crashes on Nigeria roads. His words, “This is more noticeable during ‘Ember Months’ when there are higher commuter movements across the nation (before, during and after the end of year festivities).”
