President Muhammadu Buhari has rejoiced with President of Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Comrade Ayuba Philibus Wabba, on his election as President of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the largest trade union federation in the world. The President, in a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Femi Adesina, joined members of the NLC and all Nigerian workers in celebrating the election, which further signals the great work the union had been doing in ensuring the welfare of workers. As the first African to head the ITUC, President Buhari believed the labour leader will bring his wealth of experience in persuasion and negotiation to the new position, assuring him of the Federal Government’s support. He wished the NLC President a successful tenure.
