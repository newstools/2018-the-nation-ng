Adeboye gave the waring last Friday at the annual Holy Ghost Congress of the church at the Redemption Camp, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway. The event brought together Christians faithful from 197 countries which featured prayers, Bible teachings, business and marriage seminar and prophetic ministration. Adeboye said “It has been brought to my notice that people are using m picture and my wife  on key holders, calendars,  books and other souvenirs. Anyone found with such materials should be arrested and reported to the police. “I am not God. I did not send them. I have nothing to do with those materials. I am an ordinary man. God will never share his glory with any man.” He noted that what those selling souvenirs with his pictures are doing can lead to serious trouble, not for those selling the wares,  but for him. “God will not share his glory with any man. If at any time, God senses that a  man is trying to share his glory, the man is dead, and whether the devil likes it or not, I am not going anywhere yet.” According to Pastor Adeboye, recently a woman bought a key holder with his picture and his wife inscripted on it and  gave it to her child and the child began to eat the key holder and in no time, the picture pasted on the key holder removed and surprisingly what they found was the picture of another televangelist, Prophet T. B Joshua. During the prayer session, the wife of the General Overseer,Pastor Folu Adeboye lamented the spate of killings, occultism, wickedness being perpetuated by today’s youth which according to her calls for national repentance and conscious appeal to God for forgiveness if Nigeria will ever be great again.
