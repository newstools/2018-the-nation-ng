The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Federal Government to ensure that the killers of former Chief of Defence Staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh are prosecuted. The opposition emphasized that his killers must not go the way of others. The party’s National Vice Chairman (South West), Dr Eddy Olafeso in a statement issued in Akure, the Ondo State capital said the killing of Badeh demonstrated the level of insecurity in Nigeria. In the statement signed by the South West zonal publicity secretary of the party, Ayo Fadaka, the PDP leader said “the circle of bloodletting that has viciously characterized our national life shows that Nigeria is insecure.” Olafeso noted that the killing of a high profile Nigerian was absolutely uncommon; stressing that there must be diligent investigation on his death. He  noted that Badeh continued to remain under EFCC investigation till his death, urging government to go extra mile to unearth the factors responsible for his assassination and bring the culprits to book.
