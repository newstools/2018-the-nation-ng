Lagos State Safety Commission, Ms Debite Victoria-Olu, has said adherence to tanker drivers’ checklist will prevent accidents. She spoke with the LSSC of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos yesterday against the backdrop of the Harmattan period, its attendant hazy atmosphere and transportation of petroleum products. Victoria-Olu said the agency was working in partnership with other security organisations concerned with accident-free road management “and the depot owners to check these incidents.” “The drivers’ checklist is a comprehensive preventive measure, which will not only save the driver, but also save property and lives of the people if adhered to. “There, you find out that the list stated the worthiness of the tankers allowed to load gasoline at the depot, with health safety environment officers to administer it at depots. “There are also provisions on safety measures on transit, which is at the discretion of the driver, although checked by operatives on the road. “With the hazy period around, the concern it requires is that the regulators and drivers should be more careful, heed the regulations and check such incidents that can lead to losses,” she said. These have made the Federal Road Safety Corps to carry out campaigns to check the incidents.
