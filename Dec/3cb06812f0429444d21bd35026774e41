The Chairman of Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area, Apostle Oloruntoba Oke, has inaugurated the council’s Independent Campaign Group (ICG), urging members to begin door-to-door and house-to-house campaigns for  the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidates for next year’s elections. APC had collapsed all independent groups and established a central Independent Campaign Group (ICG), to coordinate campaign activities for the party’s governorship candidate, Mr. Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu, and other candidates. Inaugurating the 18-member committee, Oke, said with the lifting of the ban on campaigns, the members must swing I to action and spread the gospel of the APC. He said: “We in Ifako-Ijaiye are happy that our local government is one of the 24 where our party decided to set up ICGs. We are confident that we shall record 100% success in the forthcoming poll as all those selected into this all imports t committee are people of proven integrity who are dependable and reliable. They are those who have the track record of handling this sort of service for the party in the past.” He urged the members to justify the confidence reposed in them, and urged them to carry out all their activities peacefully, and without any rancour whatsoever. Oke said the assignment ahead though daunting is very easy, especially in Lagos State where successive administration have been pursuing the progressive  master plan of the emeritus Governor and National Leader of the party Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who has continued to set the pace as a democrat and dependable leader. “The task ahead is undoubtedly rigourous but you are not likely to face any opposition because of the sterling performance of our great party in the state. You are to assure the people that our candidate Babajide Sanwo-Olu would coninue in the same tradition of his predecessors in bringing growth and infrastructural development closer to the people.”
