Edo State Governor, Godwin Obaseki has assured Nigerians his administration will host the best National Sports Festival since the inception of the games in 1973. Obaseki made the promise at the National Stadium in Abuja on Sunday night, moments after Edo State was handed hosting rights to the 2020 edition of the festival. Edo State finished in third place behind Rivers State and winners, Delta State at the just concluded 2018 edition of the festival hosted by the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja. An elated Governor Obaseki thanked the Federal Government for reposing confidence in Edo State by handing it hosting rights to the 2020 games.  The governor who embarked on an excursion into world history by drawing a comparison between the determination of his state to do everything possible to deliver a qualitative games, and the valiant British pilots whose sustained bombing of German lines and facilities during the Second World War, helped tilt the war in the Allies favour, said: “Ladies and Gentlemen, taking cue from the great British statesman, I and the people of Edo State assure you that the confidence reposed in us would be justified. There won’t come a time anyone will have cause to regret this momentous decision you have taken to hand us this hosting right. “Like the valiant British fighter pilots of World War II, we will take every step necessary, make every sacrifice needed, and climb every height necessary to deliver the best Games in the annals of the Sports Festival”.
