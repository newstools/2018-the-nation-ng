Ahead of 2019 election, a group within the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, has urged Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to summon a meeting with leaders of various factional groups within the ruling party to mend fences. The group consists of members of the 2016 Aketi gubernatorial campaign team, chaired by former Chairman, Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development Commission, (OSOPADEC) Chief Adewale Omojuwa. At a meeting held in Oba-ile, Akure North local government, the group also called on the governor to warn members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) in the state against attacking innocent people at any event. The politicians decried the alleged disruption of the proceedings at the state assembly recently where many people ,including journalists, were allegedly injured by NURTW members. It expressed displeasure over the use of thugs and external militia to cause pandemonium during political and or party programmes such as congresses and stakeholders’ meetings. In a communique jointly signed by Omojuwa and General Secretary, Teniola Oladele, the group expressed the need for Akeredolu to devise a means of bringing all aggrieved groups in the party together as one united and indivisible political family. On the post-primary crisis in the state, it advised the governor to direct APC State Working Committee(SWC) to refund money paid for nomination of forms by the councillorship and chairmanship aspirants since the candidates had been picked. “We implore the SWC to ensure refund of various sums of money to members who were deprived of participating in the party primaries, such as N200,000 for House of Assembly aspirants and N300,000 for Representatives.”
