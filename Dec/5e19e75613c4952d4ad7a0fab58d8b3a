Street sweepers under the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI) yesterday at Alausa, Ikeja, protested against what they called salary delay and merger with the State Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). The sweepers, who stormed the seat of government at Alausa, urged Governor Akinwunmi Ambode  to come to their rescue. The placard-carrying protesters said they preferred to remain with CLI. They demanded an increase in salary, alleging that LAWMA is planning to reduce the workforce employed under the scheme and cut their salaries. The protesters alleged that  LAWMA’s failure led to CLI’s establishment, adding: “and now that the scheme has been jettisoned, we are back to square one under the agency.” They alleged that LAWMA did not give them tools, saying: “We now provide sweeping and packing materials for our job.” The sweepers rejected LAWMA’s directive that they should dump CLI’s uniform for the one provided by the agency. One of them, Mrs. Kehinde Egbetola, said their salaries were always delayed for about one month. She added: “We don’t have tools to work with. Our colleagues are dying. We don’t have health insurance, we are not pensionable. Many other things that can be of benefit to us are lacking. We are not illiterate, some of us are graduates. “I took this job because of unemployment to keep body and soul together, but the suffering is much. “We don’t want to be merged with LAWMA because the agency is fond of enslaving workers. We were employed by the government under the CLI. “We appeal to the government to regularise our appointment. At least, we are government workers, we should be given our Oracle numbers and identity cards” to show that we are government workers.’’ Another protester, Bose Osinowo, said several of her colleagues were killed by reckless drivers while working on the road. Mrs. Kudirat Agboola said thay wanted the government to take care of the deceased’s six children, adding: “We don’t want to work under LAWMA.’’
