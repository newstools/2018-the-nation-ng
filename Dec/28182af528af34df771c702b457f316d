Tax invasion is a criminal offence and offenders will be punished in Rivers State from 2019, the Executive  Chairman,  Rivers State Internal Revenue Services (RIRS) ,  Adoage Norteh, has said. Norteh spoke with reporters in Port Harcourt, the state capital, at the weekend. He advised residents to pay their taxes. “Tax payers will want that nobody comes at all, but it is a huge departure from what it used to be, but that was deliberate government policy to make life easy for tax payers,  and what is expected of everybody (tax payers)  is to reciprocate that gesture by being tax compliant, so that we do not return to the time when people get embarrassed before taxes are payed. “But from January 2019, we will probably put people behind bars to get them pay their taxes, then others will now learn because tax invasion is criminal, it is not me who will put people behind bars, it is the law,” he said. Stanley added: “I am aware the revenue of the state has increased tremendously under your watch however, I would like to urge you to deal with the problem of double taxation in the state. This is important because of the obvious hardship it is inflicting on residents of the state. “Yes, you may be making more money for the state, but the people are the one suffering in the end.  This is because when businessmen, shop owners are subjected to numerous taxes they will be forced to increase their goods and services to the detriment of the poor resident, consumers who are the last person(s), in the distribution chain. “I will advise that you try as much as possible define and harmonise every tax payable to each level of government. Let the taxes collectable by the Federal, state and Local government be properly  defined, and let the Federal Government  tax no be duplicated by either the state or local government under a different name, this adds so much pressure on businesses and cost of living in the state.”
