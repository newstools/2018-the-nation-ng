Medical experts have been urged to carry out their professional responsibilities in accordance with high ethical standards and global best practices. A professor of Surgery and Surgical Oncology, Clement Osime gave the advice on Friday in Nnokwa, Idemili South local council area of Anambra state during the Annual General Meeting of the Medical and Dental Consultants Association of Nigeria (MDCAN) NAUTH chapter. He regretted that some medical personnel had lost their jobs, while others’ career were ruined following their inability to recognize at the same time accord patients their rights. Delivering a lecture titled, “Patients’ Bill of Rights: The Implication for the Practicing Physician”, Osime noted that gone were the days when patients tolerance the excesses of the doctors and nurses, saying they were better knowledgeable about their rights. He said, “The implication of the Patients’ Bill of Right for the practicing physician is that the physician must as a matter of necessity practice the profession of Medicine according to best practices. “What some patients would ordinarily accept a few years ago and probably say is the will of God can be subjected to litigation today. “If we practice our profession diligently, we are not likely to infringe on patients’ rights. Once we protect those rights, the patient will invariably be satisfied and there may not be litigations. “Litigations must be avoided at all cost as a single act of indiscretion by the physician may ruin an entire medical career.” He however faulted the  Patients’ Bill of Right documents, which he said, was silent on the rights of the healthcare providers, calling for its amendment.
