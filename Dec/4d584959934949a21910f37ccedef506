With the strike actions embarked upon by academic staff unions in Nigeria Universities and polytechnics, Association of National Accountants of Nigeria (ANAN), on Friday urged the Federal Government to pay attention to education in its human capital development strides. Accountants made the call during the expanded National Economic Council (NEC) meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. This was contained in a copy of the contribution of ANAN President, Alhaji Shehu Ladan to the dialogue on human capital development. According to him, basic education to improve literacy and numeracy has an important implication as a basis for human capital. He said “We need to pay attention to all spectrum of education in the country. Higher education however is a prerequisite because it produces highly competent experts that contribute to the development of organisations and the economy at large. “To this end, gaps and flaws of the education system need to be urgently addressed.” He noted that the informal and adult literacy is often neglected in the country. He also urged the government to establish special agencies with the responsibility of improving the skills and capabilities of human capital in Nigeria. He also harped on the need for government to support individuals and advised that the government should create enabling environment for private entrepreneurship to thrive. “The Infrastructure of a country goes a long way to define or influence the human capital development, eg, electricity, water, roads, communication networks,” he said. He also advised the Federal Government to improve the health sector for human capital development. According to him, only a healthy population can contribute meaningfully to the economy.
