Residents of Satellite Town in Lagos State yesterday called for the relocation of the tank farms, container terminals/ bonded warehouses in their area. The facilities, they told reporters at a briefing by the Satellite Town Forum (STF) were causing chaotic traffic. They expressed fear that the facilities could cause fire because of their proximity to people’s homes. STF Chairman Michael Imitini said the activities of the facilities owners posed danger to the inhabitants and motorists on a daily basis. Imitini said: “In a day, over 400 tankers loaded with petroleum products are trapped on a narrow road. Most time, petrol leaks from the tankers, causing panic among residents, who fear this can result in fire. The activities of the owners of these container terminals/bonded warehouses have made life unbearable for residents.” STF Press Committee Chairman Mubuisi Okafor said the tank farms and container terminals had caused accidents in which lives were lost. STF Secretary Kamol Akorede, said there was need to prevent impending disaster.
