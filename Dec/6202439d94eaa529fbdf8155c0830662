Residents of Tapa, Idumagbo and Adeniji on Lagos Island are angry with what they called the unsanitary operations of butchers in the axis. They accused the butchers of operating without licence, using areas not designated as abattoir and failing to take sanitary measures. But the Lagos Island Butchers Progressive Association (LIBPA) denied the allegations, saying it follows global best practice in its operations. In an interview with The Nation, an Idumagbo leader, Alhaji Ibrahim Kadiri, accused the butchers of polluting the environment. He said their activities started about a year ago after the Eid-El-Kabir festival. “I am sure the local government is aware of their activities, although we have not officially written them. The majority of the people involved are street boys. What we found out was that some boys last year brought rams during the Ileya festival. They killed the rams at locations and sold meat to people. The locations were about five to six on Lagos Island,” Kadiri said. He said the locations had no ideal slaughter slabs and proper channels to empty waste which could jeopardise health. A veterinary doctor living in Tapa, Rasak Alimi, said the unauthorised butchers did not meet the standard expected of an ideal slaughter slab. “I am not saying the cows are not fit for consumption, but they must be tested in order to ascertain their health condition, so that the public will not be exposed to unhealthy meat which can cause disease,” he added. LIBPA’s Alhaji Wasiu Akande said his members, under the umbrella of the Lagos State Butchers Association, with headquarters at 3, Ogunmokun Street, Mushin, were recognised by the Ministry of Agriculture. “We don’t know the illegal butchers. They are not our members. Our activities are approved by the Ministry of Agriculture with strict guidelines and facilities in place,” he said.
