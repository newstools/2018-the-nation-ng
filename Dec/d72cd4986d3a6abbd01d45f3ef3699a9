Eighteen Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) officials have been killed in the last one year, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode said yesterday. Twenty-four were injured during the same period, the governor said while addressing reporters after a strategy meeting with the LASTMA leadership and heads of security agencies at the authority’s head office in Oshodi. The governor, condoling with the bereaved families,  said he was pained by the development, which he noted should not be allowed to go on. He said the government would ensure sanity on the roads, no matter what it takes. He ordered the Ministry of Justice to increase mobile courts to 20 to try traffic offenders “because the government will not allow violation of laws. “The government will, henceforth, punish traffic offenders. We cannot allow people to commit offences. We don’t want people to take advantage and say this is Christmas or election period. We need to protect our people. We need to ensure that the roads are safe. So, we will not allow traffic offenders to go scot-free anymore,” the governor said. Ambode said more police officers had been detailed to patrol all parts of the state to ensure security and free-flow of traffic. Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal said: “The synergy between the security agencies and traffic officers will now be intensified to ensure they are safe. We urge Lagosians to be law-abiding and report any security breach around them.” Present were heads of security agencies, members of the state executive council, LASTMA Chief Executive Officer Chris Olakpe, General Manager Olawale Musa, Lagos Neighbourhood Safety Corps Chairman Israel Ajao, a retired Deputy Inspector-General of Police (DIG); Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Sector Commander Hyginus Omeje and Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps Commander Tajudeen Balogun, among others.
