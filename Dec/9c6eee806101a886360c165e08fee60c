What started on a slow pace has now become a joyful ending for Georgia Oboh at the Ladies European Tour (LET) Qualifying School Final in Morocco, as the Nigerian teenager made the cut for the grand finale of the tournament to become the first Nigerian member of the Ladies European Tour. The Edo State-born teenage golfer on the final day of qualifiers, made the top 60 cut for today’s final holding at the Amelkis Golf Club in Morocco. Despite her first tee-off ending in the lake, Oboh fought well to finish well and made the cut for the finals. From four days, over 115 players across the globe started the battle for a place in the top 60 with Oboh starting the first 78 but there was an improvement in her score on the second day with a score of 73. But on Tuesday, she played her best to net a score of 70, while on the final day where the top 60 were selected for the grand finale, the Nigerian scored 72. From the three Africans that started the campaign on Sunday, Oboh and South Africa’s Lejan Lewthwaite are the only Africans competing in the grand finale. An excited Oboh told journalists from Morocco on Wednesday that she was happy achieving her dream of becoming a LET member. “The first day was full of up and down for me but I believe I played much better on the second day. It was indeed an improved outing on the third day and the final day was a better despite starting with the first tee-off on the lake. I am happy my dream of starting my career on the European Tour has become a reality. This will surely give me the opportunity to play with the best in the world. I thank God and I am grateful to my family and supporters for their prayers and encouragement since I started this journey,” the 17-year-old said.
