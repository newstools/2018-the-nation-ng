The Environmental Rights Action, Friend of the Earth Nigeria (ERA/FoEN) has advised the Federal Government to show more commitment to the provision of renewable energy in the 2019 Budget. ERA also called for a ban on power generating sets for by ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), of the federal and the state governments, as a way to support the renewable energy campaign of Civil Society groups (CSOs) in Nigeria. Speaking during the opening ceremony of this year’s Annual National Environmental Congress in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital tagged “Post-extractivism: Energy Democracy for National Development”, the Executive Director of ERA, Godwin Uyi Ojo, said the need to end the era of  fossil energy use for renewable energy cannot be overemphasised. Ojo observed that policies on energy in the country are deficient, lack focus and devoid of community perspective. He said: “We cannot overlook the fact that a new form of energy colonialism seems to have emerged. Energy colonialism is killing the Nigerian economy. “To promote this, a percentage of the national budget should be dedicated to renewable energy research and development. All public finance, loans and subsidies being channelled to fossil fuel explorations should be halted immediately and the funds invested in renewable energy. ”We advocate for energy democracy that is decentralised, people driven and socially controlled such that citizens become energy producers as well as end users from mini-grids, and non-grid systems that are less capital-intensive. “To reiterate, energy colonialism should not lead to the dumping of petrol and diesel engines and cars from industrialised nations to Nigeria. We call for a ban on generator sets in all MDAs at the federal, state and local government levels.”
