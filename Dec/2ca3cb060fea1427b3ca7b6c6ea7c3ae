A fashion designer, Adegbenga Omojola, has been reportedly shot dead at a village in Ajah, Lagos. Six others were injured when people suspected to be land grabbers stormed the area, shooting indiscriminately. The late Omojola was hit in front of his shop at Lasisi Street, off Okere Nla Village, Ajah. He was killed while fleeing from the sounds of gunshot. A team of policemen from the nearby Langbasa Police Station took Omojola’s body to the Mainland Hospital, Yaba mortuary. Six persons, including a traditional ruler, have been arrested over the incident. They are being detained at the State Criminal Investigation Intelligence Department (SCIID), Panti, Yaba. The deceased’s father, Chief Sunday Omojola, said he knew those who killed his son, vowing to expose them “at the appropriate time.” He said: “It was me they targeted. We heard they were planning the attack. I asked Gbenga to leave the village, but he said he had so much work to do and deliver to customers before Christmas.” Those behind the attack, he said, were planning to transfer the case to Abuja in order to frustrate investigation.
