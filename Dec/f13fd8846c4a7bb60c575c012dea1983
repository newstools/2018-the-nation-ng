A Jos Upper Area Court II, sitting in Kasuwan Nama, on Tuesday sentenced Faruk Yusuf, a 33-year-old man, to three years imprisonment for unlawful possession of  live ammunitions. The presiding Judge, Mr Lawal Suleiman, handed down the sentence after the convict pleaded guilty to the one-count charge of unlawful possession of live ammunitions. Suleiman, however, gave the convict an option of N25, 000 fine. Earlier, the Prosecutor, Enegbonabe Edwin, told the court that the case was reported on Oct. 17, and transferred from the Plateau Central Police Area Command, Pankshin, to the State’s Criminal Investigative Department for further investigation. He said that on Oct. 17, a Police Constable, Mantur Augustine, attached to the Pankshin Command, suspected the accused person and conducted a search on him during which 5 live 7.9mm ammunitions were found on him. Enegbonabe said that the suspect had no licence or authority to be in possession of the ammunition. The prosecutor, however, said that the act contravened Section 27 subsection (1) of the Firearms Act. Cap F28, LFN 2004. NAN
