Kaduna State Governor, Mallam Nasir Ahmed El-Rufai on Friday, signed budget of N157.449bn appropriation bill into law for 2019 fiscal year. The governor had in August this year  presented the  budget to Kaduna State House of Assembly for  scrutiny and passage. El-Rufai also signed the 2019 budget size of N62.34bn for the 23 local government council areas of the state. According to the governor, the new financial year for the Kaduna State government and the council areas will begin on the first day of January, 2019. In his remarks after signing the budgets, El-Rufai, explained that the state approved budget size for 2019 is N157.449bn. “The approved budget size for 2019 is N157.449bn. The capital component is N94.47bn, while recurrent expenditure is N62.97bn. The budget is slightly bigger than the proposed 2019 Budget of N155.86bn but it retains the 60:40 capital to recurrent ratio” “Reflecting our commitment to human capital development, the Social Sector, including Education and Health takes up N39.14bn or 41% of the N94bn capital budget. Education has a capital budget of N25.4bn, while Health has N13.1bn, a concrete demonstration of our desire to promote equality of opportunity by putting people first” he said. The governor, while commending the State House of Assembly for the collaborative partnership said a new tradition has now been established to pass and sign state budget in the preceding year. El-Rufai said, “In 2019, for the fourth straight year, the new financial year for the Kaduna State Government will begin on the first day of January. Today, this alignment of the fiscal and calendar year for the budget of the state government is being extended to the budget of the 23 local government councils in the state. For the first time in the history of Kaduna State, we are signing the annual budgets for the state government and the 23 local government councils on the same date. This means that our local government councils will, for the first time since their creation in 1976, also begin the financial year on the first day of the new year” “It is a consistent pattern of our budgeting that the social sector takes the largest chunk of capital commitments. Thus, while the overall budget size is smaller than it was in previous years, the proportion we devote to human capital development does not shrink.  We remain resolute in implementing our education reforms which aim to improve the quality of education offered in our public schools” “For many of us, government schools gave us the education that enabled us to rise above the circumstances of our birth. We owe the children of ordinary people a duty to restore public education as a lever for social mobility. “The programme to improve infrastructure in the education sector has been hampered by the irresponsible denial at the Senate of our $350m World Bank loan. But we soldier on with the resources we have. I am happy to report that we have completed the recruitment of 25,000 new primary school teachers. We are now recruiting 7600 teachers for the public secondary schools” The governor added: “In the Health sector, 150 of our target 255 primary health centres have now been rehabilitated. In 2019, we expect to recruit over3000 health professionals to strengthen the primary health care sector. Following the passage of the law establishing the Contributory Health Management Authority, the contributory health insurance scheme will take off in Kaduna State early in 2019. “The 23 local government councils have an approved 2019 Budget of N62.34bn. In 2018, the State Government launched a Local Government Fiscal Transparency Sustainability and Accountability (LFTAS) Programme that will reward LGs that adopt best practices in budgeting, procurement, tracking absenteeism of teachers and health workers and citizen engagement among other indicators. The programme will be fully operational in 2019. We are committed to ensuring that Local governments play their role in our quest for a better state,” El-Rufai said.
