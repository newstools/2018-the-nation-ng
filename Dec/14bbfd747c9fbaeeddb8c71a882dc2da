Across section of commuters in Lagos State is angry over high transport fares, blaming drivers for not being considerate as the Yuletide draws near. The commuters told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos at the weekend that it had become unbearable, as the increases in fares were between 50 per cent and more than 100 per cent. Joyce Obi, a commuter, who boarded a CMS-bound Toyota Hiace bus from Iju-Ishaga said the fare had increased from N300 to N500. “The way drivers are demanding huge sum to convey us from one place to another in Lagos is becoming something else. “Where they used to collect N300 or at most N350, they said we should pay N500. “This means whatever you intend to do will reduce because after spending so much on transportation, what will be left to buy other things?”
