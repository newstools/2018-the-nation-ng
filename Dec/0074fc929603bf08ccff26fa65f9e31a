Osun State Governor Adegboyega Oyetola yesterday inaugurated a six-man committee to oversee the activities in the Health sector. The committee, which is chaired by the governor himself, will revive and revitalise the sector. A statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Adeniyi Adesina, said the committee, named: “State of Osun Special Health Intervention and Revitalisation,” is expected to review the state of the Health sector for efficient and effective healthcare delivery. The statement reads: “Apart from Mr. Governor, who is the chairman of the committee, other members include former Commissioner for Health, Dr. Rafiu Isamotu; Dr. Simeon Afolayan, Prof Adeyinka Aderinto, former Commissioner for Science, Innovation and Technology, Remi Omowaye and former Commissioner for Finance, Prince Bola Oyebamiji.” The statement said the committee would leverage on the quick rehabilitation and revitalisation of 332 primary healthcare centres across the state. It added that the current administration constituted the committee to meet the critical needs of the citizenry in the Health sector. Oyetola said the development was in line with the agenda of his administration to build healthy citizens by ensuring that every resident has access to health facilities. The governor said the gesture would help to make life easier for the people, particularly those at the grassroots who hitherto had some challenges. He said the rehabilitation and revitalisation process would be run under the Ministry of Health. “This is a reflection of our commitment to ensure free healthcare delivery at primary and secondary levels. It shows that we take the Health sector seriously and that we are paying serious attention to the sector.
