Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) has advised producers to provide  information for consumers  on the cartons of their products the products too. Its General Manager, Mrs. Kemi Olugbode, told yesterday reporters in Ikeja, that  some supermarkets and retail shops displayed goods without details such as expiry date/best before date, production date, batch number, etc. She said retailers of products without inscription of vital details were being educated on the need to insist that only products with the required information are purchased from their suppliers. Such basic information, she said, would show that the product was in good condition. Olugbode           said LASCOPA monitoring team and Consumer Education team go out regularly to check and ensure that displayed products are not hazardous, while educating traders on the importance of displaying wholesome goods for sale to consumers. “Our monitoring team ensures that expired products discovered in any retail shop or supermarket are removed, to ensure they are not sold to consumers,” she said The GM, who last week enjoined consumers to ensure examination of the product information and other vital details before purchasing them, said checking the details of products would not only enable consumers of perishable products to get value for their money, but would also guarantee their protection from the harmful effect of hazardous products. She said it had become necessary to educate consumers on the need to do regular check on the details of products before buying them. Olugbode said producers or sellers who flout the law by displaying or selling expired products or not complying with the requirement on display of information on products will be prosecuted as provided by the law setting up LASCOPA, especially if they fail to comply with warnings and directives from the agency.
