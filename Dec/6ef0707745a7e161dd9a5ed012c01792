Two women, Bose Kola, 19, and Deborah Ekola, 25, yesterday appeared before an Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly conspiring to kidnap two siblings. Chief Magistrate A.O. Adedayo remanded the duo at the Kirikiri Prisons, pending advice by the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Adedayo had rejected the bail application her by their counsel F.S. Oladele. “I refuse to exercise my discretion by granting the accused bail. I hereby remand them in prison pending an outcome of legal advice,” she said. Prosecutor Chinalu Uwadione told the court that the accused committed the offence on November 26, at 2:30 pm, at Gbagada, Lagos. He alleged that Kola, who was a domestic servant with the Mutanas’, conspired to kidnap the children of her employers, aged six and three. Kola and Ekola demanded N2.5 million for the kids release after holding them captive for six days. “The duo were traced by the account number provided by Ekola, which was the account they asked that the ransom be paid in,” Uwadione alleged. The offences contravene sections 2(ii), 3 and 7 of the Kidnapping Prohibition Laws of Lagos State, 2017. The chief magistrate adjourned till January 15 pending DPP’s advice.
