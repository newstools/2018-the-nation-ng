Nigeria international Emmanuel Emenike has declared himself the answer to the woes of goal-shy A-League clubs, offering his services on a performance-based deal should he go over to Australia during the January transfer window. The top scorer at the Africa Cup of Nations in 2013, as the Super Eagles soared to glory, the 31-year-old striker parted company with Greek heavyweights Olympiacos in June, and is promising the likes of Sydney FC, Wellington Phoenix, Brisbane Roar or even Melbourne City a hat-full of goals if they decide to take a punt on him. Whilst he has been active off the pitch in recent months with his marriage to Most Beautiful Girl in Nigeria 2014, Iheoma Nnadi, Emenike is desperate to re-activate his on-field career after recovering from a knee injury which blighted an underwhelming loan spell at Las Palmas. Valued at $28 million four years ago, he scored in the UEFA Champions League for Olympiacos last season but failed to fire in five league outings. Engin Durmus, the Sydney-based agent with the mandate to bring the ex-West Ham, Fenerbahce and Spartak Moscow man to Australia, said the striker is confident of “tearing it up” in the A-League. “He’s supremely confident and says he’s fit and raring to go again,” said Durmus. “He’s guaranteeing goals. He is looking for a new challenge and at 31 clearly has a lot of football left in him. Whether we get to see that in Australia I don’t know, but the desire is there and so is the quality. “
