Former Minister of Information and elder statesman Prince Tony Momoh has said that people calling President Muhammadu Buhari a clone from Sudan are ignorant and ungodly. He said, it is not easy to move ones spirit from one body to another because it’s only God that can create life. Speaking Thursday in Abuja at the annual master lecture series of the National Institute for Hospitality and Tourism (NIHOTOUR), Momoh said that just like most countries outside enjoy cultural tourism; Nigeria has come to experience spiritual tourism. He also added that the political space must be decongested if the country is to develop. His words, “The future is in Nigeria, Nigeria is a spiritual magnet for investment. Presently, people go to other countries for tourism and come to Nigeria for spiritual tourism, if the world doesn’t know now, they will but we must be politically disciplined. “The only person that created you and brought you to life is God almighty so anybody talking of cloning is talking of what human beings can do. People calling the President a clone are ignorant and ungodly, only God can create an individual, do you think a human spirit is that easy to move from one body to the other?” Acting Director General NIHOTOUR, Alh. Momoh Kabir said that the policies being set up by the present administration can grow the tourism sector. “Apart from increasing exchange earnings if this country, tourism generates wealth. People gave to visit you, when they do they have to stay somewhere, buy meals and the young men and women we are training to take people round as tour guides are paid. Unfortunately we have not gotten to the point of making people appreciate tourism but looking at the way we are going about it, u have the believe that we will get there. “In view of this present regime, you will recognize it is gearing towards a situation where eventually tourism can do provide for this country,” he said.
