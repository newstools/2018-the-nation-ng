President Buhari has challenged state governors to redouble efforts in addressing infrastructure deficiencies in their respective states to revamp the nation’s economy. The Chairman of the Governors’ Forum, Governor Abdulaziz Yari of Zamfara State, said the president stated this at a closed door with the 36 State Governors of the federation in Abuja. He said: “Mr President, as usual, responded by telling us that the economy is in a bad shape and we have to come together and think and rethink on way forward. “So, Mr President talked to us in the manner that we have a task ahead of us. So, we should tighten our belts and see how we can put Nigerian economy in the right direction and how we can address the nation’s infrastructural decay. “So, all of us as leaders especially those that are coming to the National Assembly and those coming back as governors and the president who will be re-elected by God grace we should not think that things are going to be easy. ”They are going to be harder than before, this was the message of Mr President,’’ he said. On the meeting of the National Economic Council, the governor disclosed that the Council deliberated extensively on new ways state governments could generate additional revenues for speedy economic growth and development. However, Yari declined to confirm on whether the meeting discussed the issue of the proposed N30,000 minimum wage. NAN
