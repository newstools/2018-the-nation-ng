Nigeria’s High Commissioner to the Republic of Ghana, His Excellency Olufemi Abikoye has congratulated the Super Falcons for their endeavour so far at the 11th Women Africa Cup of Nations, while charging them to go all out for victory against the Banyana Banyana of South Africa in Saturday’s final. Delivering a message from the President of Nigeria, His Excellency President Muhammadu Buhari (GCFR) when he visited the team at Presco Secondary School during their training session, Ambassador Abikoye praised the eight –time champions for seeing off the Indomitable Lionesses of Cameroon in the semi finals. “You defeated Cameroon at home the last time to win the title so everyone knew the semi final match between both teams was going to be very tough. But we thank God you put in all your strength and you listened to the instructions of the coaches and were able to come out on top. The analysts gave the match to Cameroon, but you proved them wrong.”
