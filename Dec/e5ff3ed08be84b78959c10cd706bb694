Governor Ibikunle Amosun on Monday declared that his anointed man, Hon. Abdulkabir Adekunle Akinlade, of the Allied People’s Movement (APM) has all his “blessings to pursue the mandate freely given to him” by the people of Ogun State. Amosun also vowed to give Akinlade all he has to ensure he succeeds him in 2019. The Governor who made the declaration in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, while addressing hundreds of loyalists and supporters, said he will work for the success of President Muhammadu Buhari at the polls as well as that of Akinlade. He appealed to his loyalists to cast their votes only for Buhari and Akinlade during the elections, saying he would not hide behind one finger concerning where he stands. Earlier, 26 members of the All Progressives Congress (APC) loyal to Governor Ibikunle Amosun announced their movement from the party to the Allied People’s Movement (APM), citing impunity within APC as reason for their defection. The defectors said they contested for the State House of Assembly primary conducted in the state last October 7 and declared winner the following day by the APC Committee responsible for the task but was shocked that their names were not listed as candidates by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
