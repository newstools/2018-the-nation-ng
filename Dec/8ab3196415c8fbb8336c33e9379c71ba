Justice and Development Initiative, a political pressure group, has outlined reasons why the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Akwa Ibom, Obong Nsima Ekere, is unfit to be governor. The group, in a statement  by Mr. Tom Chris Morgan,  in Uyo yesterday, accused Ekere of not executing a project given to his company years ago. “…The contract was awarded by the NDDC to Great House Investment to build a teaching hospital at the site of the Akwa Ibom State University in Mkpat Enin with N3.6 billion with a variation of N1.1 billion. “It is surprising that after six years work on the site has not reached 20 per cent completion thus denying our medical students and residents of the state the opportunity of enjoying first class medical services and training. “This is the same person that wants to be the governor of Akwa Ibom. It is because of this and many others that we are saying he is unfit to rule the state. “We therefore call on residents and indigenes to disregard his many promises of a new vision for Akwa Ibom State.” But spokesman of Nsima Ekere Campaign Organisation, Mr. Eseme Eyiboh, described allegations against Ekere as “ranting of those who want to confuse Akwa Ibom people on the new vision Nsima Ekere wants to bring to governance in the state.’’ Eyiboh said those organising protests were non-performing contractors, who want to distract the APC governorship candidate. He urged the people to disregard calls from unknown groups, which want to be noticed in this peak period of political engineering.
