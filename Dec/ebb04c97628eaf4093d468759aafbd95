The Chairman of the Elders Caucus of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Senator Olorunnimbe Farukanmi, has warned that Alhaji Alli Olanusi and his group could be santioned, if they do not desist from alleged anti party activities. He lamented that an elder like Olanusi could assemble aggrieved members to propagate falsehood because he could not have his way with the Governor Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN). Farukanmi said the recent call by the Olanusi-led group was a  device to further cause disaffection and damage to the party. He said: “It is unfortunate that Alhaji Olanusi and his group decided to revert to fanning the embers of disunity with outright lies and a wicked  call the dissolution of state executive of the State chapter at a time the party is talking about reconciliation. “You will recall that most of the people in that group did not work for the APC during the last governorship election, yet the party won. It is therefore funny to hear the say that they control over 80 percent of the party strength in Ondo State.” He advised the estranged group to retrace their steps and make good use of the opportunity avail by the reconciliation committee set up by the National Working Committee of the party to air what ever grievances they night have against the party. He affirmed the confidence and belief of the chapter in the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, the National Executive Committee, led by Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, and Akeredolu. Farukanmi said the elders  strongly have an unwavering confidence in the State Executive Committee, led by Ade Adetimehin, which a recent court judgement also attested to, to pilot the affairs of the party in the next four years.
