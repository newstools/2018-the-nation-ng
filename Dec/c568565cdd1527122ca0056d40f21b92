AAAN President Ikechi Odigb described the LAIF awards as an important event in the advertising industry because it promotes professionalism. “LAIF is committed to promoting professionalism and creative excellence within the brand industry. It reflects one of the ways we reward the great work we do all through the year. LAIF gives us an opportunity to give ourselves a pat on the back.” The chief juror, Michael Zylstra, said some of the works assessed were of topmost quality and reflected the Nigerian environment. “If I have to explain, the works that caught our attention and would be awarded tonight resonated from a Nigerian perspective and had local insight. It was executed in a way that couldn’t be done in any other country,” he said.
