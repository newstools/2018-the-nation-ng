ALagos High Court sitting in Igbosere has granted an interlocutory injunction restraining Global Resources Management Limited and LADOL from ejecting Samsung Heavy Industries (SHIN) Nigeria Limited and its subsidiary, SHI-MCI FZE, from the LADOL free zone in Lagos, pending the delivery of the judgment in the substantive suit on January 25, next year. Its Chief Operating Officer (COO), Mr. Frank Ejizu said the court order restrains LADOL from further unlawful interference with Samsung’s use of its fabrication and integration yard within the LADOL Free Zone Area. He said: “The High Court in Lagos granted an interlocutory injunction order restraining LADOL from evicting Samsung from Samsung’s fabrication and integration yard within the LADOL Free Zone. “The court ordered that Samsung be free to move in and out of its yard with its employees, agents and service providers. Furthermore, the court has directed LADOL to provide all services such as water and power supply to Samsung. This crucial court order allows Samsung to continue its operations unhindered while legal proceedings are ongoing. This is an important decision in favour of Samsung and Nigeria at a critical time. It will allow Samsung to continue to provide services vital to the completion of the Egina project, Nigerian oil production and the Nigerian economy. This decision of the High Court in Lagos is binding on LADOL and prevents it from unlawfully evicting Samsung from the fabrication yard or interfering with Samsung’s proprietary rights. He said: “Samsung is pleased that the High Court has ruled in its favour. It has restrained LADOL from evicting Samsung from the yard and required that it complies with its legal obligations to provide services to the yard and its Nigerian employees while proceedings are ongoing.”
