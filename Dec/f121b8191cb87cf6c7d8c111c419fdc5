A 43-year-old clearing agent, Babagana Shetima, who allegedly obtained N3.8 million on false pretence, on Monday appeared before an Apapa Chief Magistrates‘ Court, Lagos. Shetima, who resides at Apapa area of Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of stealing and obtaining money under false pretences. The Prosecutor, Insp. Ferdinand Asu, told the court that the accused committed the offences sometime in August, at Apapa Port, Lagos. Asu said that the accused fraudulently obtained the sum of N3.8 million from the complainant, Bello Aminu, to help him clear a container from Apapa Port. He said that the accused did not clear the container as promised and also refused to refund the complainant’s money when asked to do so. The prosecutor said that the offences contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge. Section 287 prescribes three years imprisonment for stealing, while Section 314 stipulates 15-year jail term for obtaining by false pretence, if convicted. The Chief Magistrate, Mr Michael Olubi, granted the accused bail in the sum of N1 million with two sureties in like sum. Olubi said that the sureties must be gainfully employed and should show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. He adjourned the case until Dec. 12 for mention. (NAN)
