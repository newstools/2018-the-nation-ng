HEADS of State and Government of the Lake Chad Basin Commission (LCBC) rose from their one-day summit at the weekend with a renewed commitment to the fight against Boko Haram terrorists. Their resolve is aimed at bringing a definitive end to insurgency the Lake Chad region. The regional leaders also agreed to seek the support of the community leaders to strengthen the fight against terrorism. The African leaders’ position was contained in a communiqué issued at the end of the summit convened by President Muhammadu Buhari in Abuja, on Saturday. In the communique read by LCBC Executive Secretary Mamman Nuhu, the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to the accelerated implementation of the Regional Stabilisation Strategy in the areas of Lake Chad affected by the Boko Haram crisis. The Regional Stabilisation Strategy was recently endorsed by the African Union (AU) Peace and Security Council. They, therefore, agreed to implement the Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) within the limit of available resources to provide immediate relief to the communities affected by the Boko Haram insurgency. Expressing appreciation to the AU Peace and Security Council for renewing the yearly mandate of the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) for the year 2019, the leaders also commended LCBC partners and international community for their support and contributions. They, however, urged them to extend additional assistance to the LCBC/MNJTF to eradicate the Boko Haram insurgency and to reinforce global peace and security. The leaders directed the Committee of the Chiefs of Defence Staff to meet regularly to assess the security situation and the efforts being made to bring an end to the insurgency.
