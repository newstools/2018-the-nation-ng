Nollywood is about to experience yet another wedding-classic as the movie, ‘No Budget,’ hits the cinemas, nationwide, come December 21st, 2018. Starring Bam Bam, Teddy A, Charles Inojie, Ahneeka, Bolanle Ninalowo, Kehinde Bankole, Anto Lecky, Bryan Okwara, Akin Lewis, Ayo Mogaji and others, ‘No Budget’ tells the story of Lola Balogun, daughter of the wealthy Mr and Mrs Balogun, who has a dream of having a classy, society wedding. Unfortunately for Lola, Osagie, her would-be groom, does not consent to her idea of having such an elaborate wedding ceremony, banking on her father’s wealth. Things starts to go wrong when her father also says no to her request. Producer and director of the movie, Ojie Asuelime, said that ‘No Budget’ is not a regular movie, as it addresses some issues many would find disturbing. ‘No Budget’ is sharply and comically observed, the film deals with the everyday behind-the-scene drama that saturate many homes when it comes to planning a societal wedding and captures the delicate balance between having a happily ever after marriage rather than focusing on what the society dictates a wedding should be while finding the courage to make decisions that will be of help in one’s home at the long run,” said Asuelime. On the choice of cast, Asuelime said; “Picking a cast is never easy, aside from looking at the business side, you get to look at the raw emotions and talents behind these individuals and for me I got all these and more from my cast and crew. They didn’t just hit the bar with their individuality, they also nailed it as a team and that’s the wish of a producer and an actor. No Budget is a movie nobody wants to miss. These guys delivered and I must say I am proud to have witnessed their passion first hand.”
