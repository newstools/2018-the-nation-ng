Troops of Operation Lafiya Dole have successfully repelled Boko Haram insurgentsâ€™ attack at Jakana village in Kaga Local Government Area of Borno. The insurgents coordinated the attack at Jakana barely 12 hours after the troops repelled them in Bama and Rann communities. Although there were no official comments either by the military and government agencies, reports said the gallant troops engaged the insurgents in gun duel to repel the attacks. A competent source at the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), disclosed that heavily armed insurgents attacked Jakana at about 8 pm on Friday. The source disclosed that the troops, with support of other security personnel and members of the vigilante, engaged the criminals in serious gun battle which lasted for over an hour. It said that the troops routed the insurgents and many of them escaped with gun shot wounds. The vigilante fighter added that there were no casualties on the part of the troops and members of the public in the attack. It will be recalled that gallant troops had earlier repelled attacks by the insurgents at Bama and Rann in the early morning hours of Friday. The insurgents burnt houses and a Malnourishment Treatment Centre, operated by an NGO at Rann community. The military authorities are yet to comment on the incidents.  NAN
