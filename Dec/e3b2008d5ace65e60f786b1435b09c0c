Cellulant, a digital payments service provider is improving Financial Technology (FinTech) its Agrikore and Tingg blockchain based platform. The smart contracting, digital financial services/payments and customer relationship management system is transforming the way digital and financial services is done. Speaking at the Global Endeavor gala in New York City, Co-founder Cellulant, Bolaji Akinboro said the economic opportunity and capital investments are critical to Cellulant’s tremendous success in sub-Saharan Africa. The Endeavor network, headquartered in New York City with offices around the world pioneered the concept of high-impact entrepreneurship in growth markets around the world. He said that ‘‘through agriculture, for instance, the company has been able to put up a payment technology capable of solving real-world problems. The African agricultural sector is a $330 Billion fragmented industry which is fundamentally being driven by cash. Hence our resolve to organise and digitise the money flowing in this sector”. In a related development, Ken Njoroge underscored the immense business opportunities Endeavor would make with its entrant into the African (Nigerian and Kenyan) market. ‘‘It needs large pipelines on start-ups so that they can go through the different stages of business growth. The network staying through to its core values have the potential to change the business ecosystem in Africa’’.
