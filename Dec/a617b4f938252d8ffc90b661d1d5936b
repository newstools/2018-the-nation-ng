Access Bank Plc could raise up to $457 million or about N165.6 billion in new debt and equities capital to support ongoing business combination with Diamond Bank Plc. Access Bank will be the post-merger entity and its Group Managing Director, Mr Herbet Wigwe, will remain the chief executive of the enlarged bank. At a joint media briefing in Lagos yesterday to outline key details of the business combination, Access Bank and Diamond Bank said the business combination was driven by value accretion and synergies, citing the potential to become Africaâ€™s foremost financial institution. Access Bank said it has received regulatory approvals to raise up to $457 million, equivalent to about N165.58 billion, in tier 11 capital and equity funds to ensure that the post-merger entity has robust capital buffer in line with national and international requirements. The capital raising includes a $250 million tier 11 capital and a $207 million rights issue. Both capital raisings are expected to be concluded in the first half of 2019, in time for the completion of the business combination, which is also scheduled for the end of first half 2019. In order to meet international standards of best practice and ensure a robust capital buffer, Access Bank and Diamond Bank have also jointly agreed a strategic capital management plan and expect to achieve a post-completion Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 20 per cent at the bank level and 22 per cent at the group level.
