The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) has charged the clergy and other religious leaders to always include road safety tips in their sermons to ensure the message permeated all nooks and crannies of the society. The State Sector Commander of the Corps, Mr Sunday Ajayi who stated this in Awka, said regular stressing of such messages would further increase safety consciousness among motorists and other road users. He disclosed that thirty persons have been convicted by the Mobile Court of the Anambra State Command of for various traffic offences. He said the penalties of the convicts depended on the gravity of the offences committed. Assuring that the Command would leave no stone un-turned in its effort to ensure sanity on the highways, Ajayi cautioned motorists against acts capable of causing carnage on the roads. The Sector commander underscored the need for them to always ensure their vehicles were in good condition before embarking on any journey. He said, “The command will deploy its officers and men to all flash points across the State as part of efforts in reducing gridlock on the highways, especially during this yuletide. “We will also carry our campaign on road safety measures to all the twenty-one local government areas of the State, in addition to increasing its campaigns on both print and electronic media.” Ajayi commended the State government, individuals, groups and co-operate bodies, for their support to the Command, calling for its sustenance.
