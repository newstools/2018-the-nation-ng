In the absence of her Akwa Ibom’s teammate, Segun Toriola made use of his years of experience to silence critics after emerging as men’s singles champion while Abuja’s Ajoke Ojomu also claimed the women singles title of table tennis event of the 19th National Sports Festival holding in Abuja. Criticisms have trailed the participation of Olufunke Oshonaike and Toriola in the competition particularly as they represented their adopted state – Akwa Ibom. After they were beaten in the semifinal of the mixed doubles by Oyo’s duo of Taofeek Maya and Funmilola Ajala, the rising profile of the former African stars began to dwindle. However, Oshonaike’s dream of ‘winning’ the gold medal for Akwa Ibom was thwarted in the quarterfinal of the women’s singles as the Germany-based star was shown the exit by Lagos’ Nimota Aregbesola. But Toriola in his usual style was not discouraged by the criticisms as he went about with his business taken down most of his younger opponents. In the men’s singles final against Bayelsa’s Ganiyu Ashimiyu, it was as if they fans were against Toriola at the venue. And when the younger Ashimiyu won the first game, the fans went wild hoping that the end has come for Toriola. That experience cannot be bought came to fore as Toriola ensured that the match was beyond his opponent and within few minutes, he has dismissed Ashimiyu 4-1 to claim the gold medal to the chagrin of his critics. Former junior international, Ojomu was in her best form as she defeated Cross River’s Cecelia Akpan to claim the gold medal in the women’s singles. The final of the singles event was the climax of the table tennis event of the multi-sports fiesta.
