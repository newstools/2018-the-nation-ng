Amstel Malta has awarded Samson Itodo the “Young Person of the Year” at the just-concluded 2018 Future Awards Africa. The Future Awards, which was launched in 2005, rewards deserving young Nigerians and Africans who have carved a niche for themselves in their chosen field. The awards celebrate young people who have made outstanding achievements in the year.

Speaking at the event in Lagos, the Marketing Director, Nigerian Breweries Plc. Emmanuel Oriakhi, said the brand was proud to be part of the process of rewarding youngsters for their efforts in their individual journeys.

Amstel Malta’s readiness to support laudable projects like this further solidifies the brand’s stance at applauding excellence. “We have big plans in place and we urge everyone to prepare for the greater things ahead.” Awards received were  aimed to celebrate young Nigerians between the ages of 18 and 31, acknowledging them for making a difference through social good, social enterprise and creativity.
