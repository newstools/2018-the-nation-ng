The police have arrested a woman, Mrs. Chioma Obi, for allegedly beating up her 13-year-old housemaid, Ngozi Mba, with an electric cable. She may be arraigned today for alleged child abuse and domestic violence. A non-governmental organisation (NGO), the International Charitable Initiative for Girl Child and Woman Development Foundation (ICI-GWODEF), is pursuing justice for the injured maid. The incident was said to have occurred last Friday at their 7, Maxwell Street, Ago Palace Way, Okota, Lagos home. The Nation gathered that the maid had cut the finger nails of her boss’ children and threw them away. On their mother’s return, Ngozi, on enquiry, said she cut the kids’ nails. A source said Mrs. Obi accused her of planning to use the nails for ulterior purpose. The proprietress of the maid’s school, Mrs. Helen Nwafor, sought to know what happened to her when she got to school the next day. The proprietress took her to Century Police Station on Ago Palace Way, Okota to lodge a complaint. The maid has told the police she would not like to return to her boss’ home. But her mother is pleading with ICI-GWODEF to forgive Mrs. Obi because she was taking care of and educating the girl. The matter has been transferred to the Gender Desk of the Lagos State Police Command.
