President Muhammadu Buhari’s presentation of the 2019 Appropriation Bill to the Joint Sitting of the National Assembly began on a rancorous note on Wednesday. When he stated the presentation will be his last for the term at the commencement of his speech, some lawmakers shouted amen. However, on being interjected at every mention of the modest achievement by his administration in all sectors of the economy, the President was interrupted by claps from those believed to be members of the All Progressives Congress (APC). But opposition lawmakers reacted with boos. When he informed the economy recovered from recession, which drew the same response from the floor, the President had to take it again. At this point, the President took a short break from his address to advise the lawmakers to be cautious and mindful of the importance of the day. “The world is watching us, we are supposed to be above this,” he said. Earlier, on resumption of the joint sitting from the over 40- minute closed session, the lawmakers with the two presiding officers seated, broke into freedom song. With some on their feet, they sang ‘Freedom come, by struggle, by struggle, freedom come‘. Some members were seen collecting and tearing placards carried by their colleagues. Fight almost broke out when Bashir Babale (APC, Kano) was dragged away from Diri Douye (PDP, Bayelsa) after he attempted to collect a placard from him. When Vice President Osinbajo was quietly led into the chamber by the Presidential Liason Officer (Senate) Eta Enang, the song abated but picked up again until Senate President Saraki asked his colleagues to take their seats “Thank you for your understanding. Thank you so much,” he said. Saraki’s pleas were followed by some Senators throwing words at themselves across the seats, forcing the song to break out again. Buhari was ushered into the chamber with chants of ‘Sai Baba’ and ‘Freedom come’ renting the air.
