Lagos State Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal yesterday warned members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) against being used by politicians to disrupt next year’s elections. His warning followed allegations that some politicians were arming NURTW members to cause chaos, if their candidates did not win election. Edgal spoke at a meeting with chairmen of the 64 parties, their candidates and security agencies at the Police Officers’ Mess, Ikeja. He said: “There is an allegation that people are arming NURTW members to cause problem during the elections. I warn that we will meet force with force, fire with fire.” The meeting was triggered by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Jimi Agbaje’s allegation that his campaign posters and billboards were removed by unknown persons. Advising candidates to use the Lagos State Signage and Advertisement Agency (LASAA), Edgal said: “Lagos State is politically mature. The removal of the billboards and posters could not have been an intentional act. That was why I invited the LASAA Managing Director, Mr. Mobolaji Sanusi, to be here today, in order to clear the air on the issue.” Sanusi said the posters and billboards were removed from some roads because the parties concerned did not obtain permission. He said it was only the All Progressives Congress (APC) that obtained permission before placing their campaign posters. The LASAA boss said there were rules guiding the pasting of bills, adding that the agency usually undertook weekly clean-up to remove unapproved bills. Resident Electoral Commissioner Sam Olumekun advised politicians to focus on issue-based campaign, instead of things that could result in violence. He said the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) would ensure free, fair and credible elections, which  could only be achieved in a peaceful atmosphere. Present were all the candidates except Agbaje, who was represented by his running mate, Mrs. Haleemat Busari.
