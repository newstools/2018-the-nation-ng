The Lagos and Delta state men handball teams gave the fans a lot to cheer about as they played a pulsating draw (28-28) in one of the games played at the National Sports Festival (NSF) IN Abuja. Both sides had won a match apiece and a win would have put the victors in pole position in Group B, but both teams played their part in the exciting game, which brought out the best in both sets of players. Speaking after the game, Secretary of the Lagos State Handball Association, Bintu Ojikutu stated that the match was keenly contested and could have gone either way. He gave Kudos to the Lagos team for their performance in the festival. She stated that the match would go down as one of the best at the NSF and urged the team to do more in their quest to win the gold. “The game very exciting and both teams gave a good account of themselves. It could have gone either way but what is most important for me is for Lagos to move to the semi-final stage. Ojikutu noted that the team would do better when they take on Niger today. “I believe that the players have what it takes to take on Niger today. Niger State is a strong handball playing state but we have what it takes to win.” The Lagos team has a win and a draw; and a win in today’s game will take it to the nest round of the competition.
