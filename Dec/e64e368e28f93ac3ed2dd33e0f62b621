A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Bolaji Ayorinde, has said that many state governors are using the issue of Internally Generated Revenue (IGR) as a diversionary tool to cover up their mismanagement of funds available to them to better the lot of the people. Ayorinde, who is the Social Democratic Party governorship (SDP) guber candidate in Oyo State, noted that the debate and excuse of low and poor IGR as being used by many state chief executives is unacceptable. He noted that if government can reduce the cost of governance and public procurement as well as prioritise its projects to concentrate on the most pressing need of the people, the people and society at large would be better for it. The Oyo State SDP governorship flag-bearer spoke yesterday at the party secretariat, Dugbe, Ibadan, where he addressed journalists and party faithful on his plans for the state if given the opportunity to govern come 2019. While noting that it could be difficult for the electorate whom he said has been ‘deliberately pauperised by the ruling class,’ not to sell their votes for a token, Ayorinde called on the media to help educate the people on the grave implication of vote-buying, assuring that his party “will not buy votes because anyone who does so is only buying the office of the governor as a commercial venture. Transparency shall be our hallmark. “Past governments have made finance and ability to pay workers’ salaries an issue of regret and pain for the people particularly the civil service. There is no rocket science in dealing with this. We shall reduce the cost of governance and public procurement.  If we plug wastes and don’t indulge in grandiose projects you will be surprised how easy it will be to pay salaries. If there is no waste and no corruption, the resources of the state including IGR will be sufficient for all,” he said.
