The several programmes put in place by Lagos State yielded positively in the squash event of the 19th National Sports Festival as athletes from the aquatic city dominated the event claiming gold medals in the singles. From the men’s singles final, it was a Lagos State affair as Wale Amao and Olanrewaju Abdulrahman clashed with Abdulrahman having an upper hand with a 2-1 win. Nigeria’s number one female squash star – Yemisi Olatunji reaffirmed her status as the country’s best with a 3-0 routing of Rofiat Abdulazeez of Kwara  in the final. Despite beating Amao to claim the gold medal, Abdulrahman admitted that it was a tough match as both players are familiar foes. “We know each other in and out, so beating him in the final was so tough, but thank goodness I won,” he said. Being his third appearance in the multi-sports fiesta, Abdulrahman was excited about his first medal. After the festival exploits, Abdulrahman planned to play a pre tournament in the United States early next year, but he will need all necessary support and sponsorship. “I used to join my prize monies to whatever I could get around for me to play in most of the international tournaments I have featured because I believe I have to make sacrifices. I want to appeal to governments and private spirited people to assist my aspirations and ambitious to grow in my career,” he added. To Olatunji, it was indeed an exciting final against her opponent. “It was a good game and a good fight for me. I feel so elated winning another festival medal. I won gold and bronze medals at the Lagos 2012 Games. I must say that winning a gold medal for Lagos State is a big achievement for me. “After this festival, my focus will be on the Old Trafford tournament in Lagos, ”said Olatunji who had won tournaments in Zimbabwe and a PSA competition at the Ikoyi Club this year.
