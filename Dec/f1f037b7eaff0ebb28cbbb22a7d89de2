Music maker Badmus Akeem O, aka Baddy Oosha, is partnering Nigerian top music site, Naijaloaded to search for new musical talents in a challenge tagged ‘Who Dey’. The quest is to give upcoming artistes alternative means of launching their career. ‘Who Dey’ has been made open to all classes of artistes since December 11, 2018 and will close on December 24, 2018. Aspiring artistes are to go through four steps and pronto, the winner gets a video shoot of any of their song with ace video director, Lucas Reid, courtesy of Baddy Oosha and Naijaloaded. The first step as described by organisers entails downloading the official instrumental via www.naijaloaded.com of the song ‘Who Dey’ (The challenge) with hook and chorus produced by Young John. Step two entails the artiste making a video with their own version of rap, song or freestyle, using any language of their choice, while step three enjoins the artiste to upload on Instagram with the hashtag #baddyooshawhodey and also tag and follow @baddyoosha and @naijaloadedcomng. The last step gives the artiste entry when they repost the flier of the challenge on the page of baddy Oosha @babbyoosha. Baddy Oosha is a business man, who owns a audio and visual equipment company in Dubai known as Oosha Empire Audio and Visual Equipment Company. He’s also an International promoter and a musician with over 10 singles to his credit.
