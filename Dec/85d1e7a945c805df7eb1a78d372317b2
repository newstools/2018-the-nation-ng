The Federal Government on Monday resumed talks with the leaders of the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) over the ongoing strike in public polytechnics. The union embarked on strike on December 12. The meeting which began around 11 am at Federal Ministry of Education was called by the Minister, Adamu Adamu. An official of the ministry said the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Sunny Echono, who represented the minister, chaired the closed-door meeting. ASUP National President, Usman Dutse, led the union’s delegation to the closed –door meeting. Mr. Dutse, told The Nation on telephone that the meeting was “inconclusive.” He said the union would meet officials of the ministry at a new date yet to be announced. Dutse said: “Yes the meeting was held but it was inconclusive. We are going to continue on another date. We have not concluded or resolved on anything. “We will continue the meeting from what where we stopped. The minister was not at the meeting. It was with the perm sec. “All the outstanding issues were discussed but we have not concluded. There are some things to be done before the next meeting. That will guide our decision. “Since we have not concluded, we cannot say we are satisfied but a step has been taken and it is in a positive direction.” The union cited the non-implementation of the NEEDS Assessment report of 2014, non-payment of salaries in state-owned institutions, non-payment of allowances and alleged victimization of union members, among others, as reasons for embarking on strike. ASUP had gone on strike in November 2017 but suspended it after two weeks when the federal government agreed to implement the recommendations of the 2014 NEEDS assessment. The agreement particularly highlighted the need for increased funding of polytechnics. The polytechnic lecturers joined their university colleagues who have been on strike since November 4.
