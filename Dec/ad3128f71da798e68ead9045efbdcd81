To make my family, friends and fans proud at all times. I also want to be able to surprise myself and shock the industry with my music. Sniffy who describes his genre as indigenous and international renditions of the pop and R&B genre further said “listening to the single you would agree that there is a fusion of the music we make indigenously and the progressions we hear from foreign lands. This is because I grew up listening to the veterans of R&B and pop music. Like,usher,Psquare Tevin Campbell and others like them. This, mixed with what we hear today is simply “Sniffy”.
