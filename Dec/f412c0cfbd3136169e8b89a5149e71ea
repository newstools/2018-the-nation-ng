•Court bound them to be of good behaviour An Ebute Metta Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday granted hip-hop artiste Temitope Adekunle aka Small Doctor and three of his band men N5 million each. The other are Dare Osho, Sanusi Lateef and Hussein Darego. Chief Magistrate A. O. Komolafe also bound them to be of good behavior for one year. The orders were at the instance of the police, which sought that they be bound for 12-months “not to engage, recruit, instigate or incite any resident of Shogunle and Lagos State by extension, to cause breach of the peace within or outside the community”. The police supported their application with a seven-paragraph affidavit deposed to by Inspector Kasali Saturani. Saturani averred that the defendants were found with a double barrel pistol at Shogunle. Small Doctor was represented by his counsel, Mr. Yakubu Eleto. Akeem Shittu represented the others. Prosecutor Cyril Ajifor, an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP), prayed the court for an order that Small Doctor and the others should enter into a recognisance with sureties to keep the peace in Shogunle and its environs for one year. Ajifor also prayed for an order that the defendants “should not engage, recruit, instigate or incite any member of the community to cause breach of the public peace within or outside the community” for same period.
