The Shippers’ Association of Lagos State (SALS) has urged the Federal Government to pay more attention to port infrastructure. The government, the group said, should position the ports to meet international best practices. Its President, Mr Jonathan Nicol,  gave the charge in a chat with The Nation. He called for the resuscitation of the informal sector of cargo management. According to him, the informal sector will contribute about 45 per cent of the total cargo throughput (imports and exports). He said  there was need to rebuild dead infrastructure at the ports to enable individuals in the sector to assist in nation-building. The Executive Secretary, Nigerian Shippers Council, Mr Hassan Bello, advised members of the group to export, especially non-oil items. Bello said so far, 27 shippers associations have been established across the country. He said these associations are formidable bodies for cargo protection. “Shippers should endeavour to channel efforts into export-ation of value-adding non-oil exports to generate revenue. “The Council is committed to protecting the cargo interest of Nigeria and also enjoins you to remain compliant with both national and international rules guiding global trade practices. “The SALS have been very active. I must commend them for their doggedness and laudable ideas and I hope they continue,” Bello said. Also, a maritime lawyer, Mr Doipo Alaka, said there was the need for operators to embrace maritime arbitration to resolve issues which emanated from their business. He said arbitrators had been in existence for more than 10 years, adding that the arbitrators had assisted several port operators to solve maritime disputes.
