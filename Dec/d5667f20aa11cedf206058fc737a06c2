A non-governmental organisation (NGO), the Movement for Disabled Right Forum, in conjunction with a United States of America-based health foundation, the Xanderena Foundation, has organised a one-day health talk on how people will change their perception towards people living with disabilities. Its Coordinator, Comrade Kehinde Oshilaja, speaking during the programme held at the weekend in Ebute-Metta, Lagos, said not everybody living with disabilities should be seen as beggars. Some of them resorted to begging because the government failed to assist them, he said. Oshilaja urged the government to create a special budget for the educated and serious ones among them. According to him, the government should assist the physically-challenged financially and morally. He said most of them are intelligent and can compete favourably with their counterparts who have no defects, if given the opportunity like able-bodied people. “We call on our rulers and politicians to assist us, because we deserve to be treated equally like able-bodied people. We are all Nigerians,” Oshilaja said The founder of the foundation, Irene Iwerebon, said free medications would be distributed at the event.
