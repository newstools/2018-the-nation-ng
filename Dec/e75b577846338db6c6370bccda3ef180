Lagos State Commissioner for Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Oluwo Olawale Wasiu has resigned both as commissioner and member of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Wasiu who hails from Epe, submitted his resignation as commissioner to Ambode in his office Wednesday morning. He based reasons for on the conduct of the October 2018 primary election of APC in the state which he said leaves much to be desired. Describing the primary as integrity-deficient, Wasiu said it has diminished the hard-earned reputation of the state as a reference point for free and fair democratic practice.
