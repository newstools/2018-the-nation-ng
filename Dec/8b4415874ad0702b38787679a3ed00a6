Air Peace has apologized to its customers over the disruption of their flights on different routes on Friday. A statement issued by the airline’s Corporate Communications Manager, Mr Chris Iwarah said some of the carrier’s scheduled flights were disrupted due to a depressurization challenge on its Lagos-Enugu flight. Iwarah said this compelled the airline to declare the aircraft unserviceable in line with its uncompromising stance on matters of safety. According to him, the airline regrets the resultant delay of flights on several routes due to the development. He said “on Dec. 14, our Lagos-Enugu flight had a depressurization challenge, compelling us to declare it unserviceable upon safely landing at destination in line with our strict safety standards. “Although depressurization is a common occurrence in aviation, we sincerely regret that the incident led to the disruption of our Enugu-Lagos service and other flights the aircraft was scheduled to operate. “We are indeed sorry for the resultant inconvenience caused our esteemed customers. “We have, however, made alternative arrangements to ensure the operation of the Enugu-Lagos and other services the aircraft was scheduled to do, while our team of engineers conduct proper checks on the aircraft, which has since been ferried to our base.’’ Iwarah assured members of the flying public that Air Peace would continue to accord their safety a prime place in its operations and always act in their best interest. “We urge our valued customers to continue to trust us to deliver the best flight experience to them. “We quite understand the expectations of our esteemed customers, especially during the Yuletide and we wish to assure them that we will neither disappoint nor take their patronage and loyalty to our brand for granted.’’ NAN
