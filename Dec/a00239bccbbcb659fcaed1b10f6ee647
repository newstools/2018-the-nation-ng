A pressure group; the Grassroots Social Mobilization and Accountability Network (GSMAN) has highlighted reasons why President Muhammadu Buhari should be reelected in next year’s polls. The group, in a communique issued at the end of its National Executive Committee meeting, held in Owerri, Imo state, made available to the Nation in Warri yesterday, cited security, anti-corruption campaign and the economy as areas where the current administration had made marks. According to the communique signed by Comrade Lucky Dudun and Chief Chizi Woko, National Coordinator and Public Relations Officer of GSMAN respectively “The successes achieved so far in the fight against insurgency in the North East, the fight against corruption, which has exposed some of the looters of our treasury and the diversification of our economy” were some of the administration’s achievements. The group, which boasted of having members across the country, also pointed out that the Buhari-led administration did not stop with the three main areas of focus, adding  “ongoing construction of rail lines all over the country”, as part of its achievements. The group also vowed to ensure that the All Progressive Congress (APC) retains all the states it won in 2015 as well as win more states in the South-East and South-South in 2019. While promising to join forces with “other progressive movements in the country to actualize the victory of APC in 2019”, GSMAN also said it would “identify fully with the leadership of the APC at all levels, because  it is the most progressive of all the current political parties in the country”.
