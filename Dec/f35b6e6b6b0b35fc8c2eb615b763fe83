A 35-year-old estate agent, Gbeminiyi Babajide, was yesterday arraigned at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding his estranged lover of N5 million on the pretext of investing it in a business, Prosecutor Michael Unah alleged that the accused collected N5million from Oluwaseun Giwa on the pretext of helping her to invest it in business. He said the accused committed the offence between 2014 and 2016 at Surulere, Lagos Mainland. Unah alleged that the complainant transferred the N5 million, which she intended to use to open a supermarket into the account of the accused in order to keep it for her. “The complainant entrusted the N5 million to the accused while they were in a relationship. “The accused converted the money to his use without the complainant’s consent, after they had gone their separate ways. “Efforts to recover the money proved abortive, as the accused resorted to threatening her whenever she asked for the money,” he said. The accused pleaded no guilty. Chief Magistrate A. A. Fashola granted him N250, 000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties must be employed, with evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government and their addresses verified. The sureties, he added, must live within the court’s jurisdiction. The case continues on January 30.
