About 120,000 pupils in Anambra State have benefited from the National Home Grown School Feeding Programme, Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Social Investment, Mrs. Chinwe Iwuchukwu, has said. Iwuchukwu, who spoke yesterday in Awka at a one-day Linkage and Reorientation Workshop for cooks and farmers, hinted that about 1,062 cooks, serving in 1,060 government primary schools, were involved in the programme. She explained that the programme, which had been on since December 2016, was aimed at increasing school enrolment, improve nutrition, increase agricultural production as well as create jobs. The aide hailed Governor Willie Obiano for ensuring that Anambra started the school feeding first. Commissioner for Agriculture, Mechanisation, Processing and Export Afam Mbanefo, who opened the workshop, said the programme had created 1,062 and 3,000 direct and indirect jobs. He said: “The workshop is to establish link between the farmers and the cooks, so that the farmers will supply products to the cooks at a reduced price to ensure that the program continues to achieve its desired objectives.”
