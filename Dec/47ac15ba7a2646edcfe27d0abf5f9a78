Benson Idahosa University (BIU) has been granted full affiliation to the Joint Universities Preliminary Examinations Board (JUPEB). The development is contained in a letter sent to the Acting Vice-Chancellor (VC), Prof Sam Guobadia, by the Registrar of the board, Prof Duro Ajeyalemi. The letter reads: “I am pleased to convey to you that on behalf of the JUPEB Governing Board, the chairman, Prof Oluwatoyin Temitayo Ogundipe, has approved the recommendation of the Pre-Affiliation Visit (PAV) team, which visited your university, that your school be granted Full Affiliation to JUPEB. This approval will be ratified at the next governing board meeting. That is, your university is now approved as a centre for JUPEB examinations.” It should be recalled that the board conducted a pre-affiliation visit to BIU on October 8, 2018. During the visit, Prof Guobadia stressed the continuous commitment of the university towards running JUPEB programmes to create more opportunities for Nigerian youths to access quality education. As a result of this full affiliation, BIU can now accept candidates for the JUPEB Foundation programme, as well as start training of the foundation candidates with the JUPEB’s syllabus for each subject. Successful students of the JUPEB programmes are eligible for admission into degree programmes at the university.
