Signal Alliance, Microsoft and Cisco have partnered to deliver the Azure Stack solution to enterprises. Azure Stack is an innovative hybrid cloud computing solution designed to help organisations deliver their various services efficiently from their own data centers. Speaking at the workshop where the solution was unveiled in Lagos,  Signal Alliance Azure Practice Lead, Uche Nwaukwa, described the solution as an extension of Microsoft Azure, which brings the agility and fast-paced innovation of cloud computing to on-premises environments. At the workshop, participants were shown how Azure Stack can enable businesses and government agencies leverage cloud capabilities and still maintain regulatory requirements around data residency, including Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) compliance. There was also a demonstration of how the solution serves as hybrid cloud computing platform for edge and disconnected scenarios which address latency and connectivity issues, including simple and easy-to-use analytics. While speaking on the development,  Head, Platforms & Applications, Signal Alliance, Sikiru Abass, said it enables organisations to build modern applications across hybrid cloud environments, balancing the right amount of flexibility and control. Moreover, with Azure Stack, developers can speed up new cloud application development by building on application components from the Azure Marketplace, including open source tools and technologies. With this consistent cloud platform, organisations can confidently make technology decisions based on business requirements, rather than business decisions based on technology complications. Azure Stack is an integrated solution made up of software and hardware components. Microsoft owns the software, while Cisco and other approved vendors support with their proprietary hardware. Signal Alliance acts as the partner delivering the solution and providing support for user organisations in Nigeria.
