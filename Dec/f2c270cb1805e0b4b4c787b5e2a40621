Over 20 gospel artistes are set to thrill Nigerians at the maiden edition of the Seraph Youth Mega Praise concert coming up on Friday, December 14, 2018, at the National Stadium, Surulere, Lagos. The musical event, tagged: ‘Praising God in beauty of His holiness’ has been anticipated as the largest gathering in the history of the church, as youths in all parts of the country are expected to attend. Speaking at a press conference, Reverend Mother Abimbola Esther Ajayi said she got the vision from God through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to be executed by the youth of Cherubim and Seraphim Church. “This mega praise reminded us of how we can win our battles with our weapon of praise,” she said. “The concert is to create an atmosphere of praise and give glory to God for His love towards us as the year is going to an end and get ready for a new beginning. We are also encouraged as Christians to praise God at all times, irrespective of any situation we found ourselves. “It is also essential to bring together all Christian youth, irrespective of their denomination and foster unity amongst them and various churches that profess Jesus Christ as their Lord and saviour. The revered mother, however, admonished to the federal government to declare a day as “National Praise Day” where all Nigerians, irrespective of their religion or tribe, will come together in unison to appreciate the kindness of God. Artistes billed to lead the praise include Tope Alabi, Esther Igbekele, Lanre Teriba, Aduke Gold, Bisi Alawiye, Dare Melody, Azadus, Bunmi Akinnanu, Rachael Ogunyemi and many others. Also, comedians like Kenny Blaq and Woli Agba will grace the event. The organising committee announced that free buses will be available in the different regions of Lagos to convey people to the venue and also assure for maximum security of participants.
