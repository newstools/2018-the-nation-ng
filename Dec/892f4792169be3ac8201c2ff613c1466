Lecturers of the University of Osun State Osogbo on Monday refused to resume academic activities following a directive by the institution’s chapter of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The institution was billed to resume on Monday with many students already excitedly looking forward to being back on campus. But a memo by ASUU’s branch chairman and secretary warned lecturers who resume will be accused of strike breaking. It reads: “If lectures and other activities should start today it would be regarded as an act of strike breaking and the union doesn’t handle cases of strike breaking with levity. “The union reminded the varsity management that the ongoing strike is total and comprehensive.” ASUU embarked on a nationwide strike on November over unfulfilled agreements by the Federal Government. The National President Biodun Ogunyemi told lecturers nationwide to be prepared for a long-drawn struggle. Ogunyemi, who charged members of the union to remain steadfast and resolute in the face of intimidation or antics by government through Vice Chancellors and Governing Councils to undermine the ongoing struggle, said: “Government is yet to change its keep them talking style and stance as all the meetings held so far with the Minister of Education are yet to resolve any of the demands of the union.”  Attempt to get the official reactions from the varsity proved abortive.
