Residents of Isolo, Jakande Estate, Ejigbo, Egbe, Ikotun and are worried over the incessant  gridlock between Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH) Isolo and Ikotun roundabout. They are urging the government to fix the potholes and expand the road, to ensure  free vehicular movement. A resident, Daniel Diekola, said the traffic jam hindered business, adding that the bad road had forced many residents to relocate. “The road is narrow. It discourages residents from doing business. In fact, some of them have left this area,” he said. Diekola enjoined the government to prioritise the repair and expansion of roads linking communities. A commercial motorcyclist, Tunde Owoiya, begged the government to expand the road. He said: “It is impossible for two vehicles to move at the same time. This is one of the causes of the gridlock.” Another resident, Jimoh Alli, said he almost abandoned his car on the road when a fuel tanker hit a Toyota Camry, causing traffic jam. “I have resorted to riding commercial motorcycles, which is risky and costly. But I don’t have a choice because I prefer to beat the traffic, which builds up daily. I spend N1,000 to and from work everyday. How much is my earning? If I refuse to ride Okada, it means I am ready to stay in the traffic till midnight. The government needs to act fast because this is a road that links many communities,” he said. Toyin Oyetola, said the government should stop tankers, especially those carrying containers, from plying the road.
