The No Alternative To Buhari-Osinbajo 2019 (NATBO 2019), has condemned the conduct of the opposition lawmakers, during the presentation of the 2019 budget by President Muhammadu Buhari to the joint session of the national assembly, last Wednesday. In a statement signed by the National Coordinator of the group, Mr. Vincent Uba, it described the action of the lawmakers as deplorable, and capable of smearing the image and credibility of Nigeria in the international community. “Inasmuch as democracy bestows freedom of expression on the citizenry, that freedom is not absolute to the level of embarrassing the Nigerian nation in an attempt to get at the sitting President, because of his seemingly endearing popularity before the electorate in the run-up to the presidential election in a few weeks. “Despite the vexatious attacks and obvious acts of frustration that the national assembly has melted out on President Buhari since he assumed office three and a half years ago, he has grown thick-skin to allow democratic peace to reign,” the group said. The group said it  had expected the lawmakers to be  above board on such an auspicious occasion of budget presentation by the president,  despite the provocative opposition tendencies that had become the order of day in recent times . “We do not know why this eight assembly chose to display these recalcitrant acts against a respected and disciplined icon of the nation who has tried not to meddle in the affairs of the assembly since its inception, as against what used to happen in the previous administrations, when  presidents were known to remove and change national assembly leadership at will.  Ironically, these opposition law makers are campaigning to come back in few weeks to drag us back to the days of throwing chairs and flexing muscles in the chambers.” The group therefore thanked President Buhari, “who in his characteristic manner, handled the situation with maturity and calmness, an indication that he is truly an elder statesman and father of the nation.”
