Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) has embarked on evacuation of expired products from supermarkets as part of efforts to guarantee the safety of consumers in Lagos from all forms of unwholesome products. Expired products were removed from the shelves of multi-chain stores in Magodo G.R.A and along Mobolaji Johnson Way, Alausa, Ikeja, during a routine monitoring exercise of LASCOPA. According to the General Manager of the Agency, Mrs. Kemi Olugbode, the expired products were immediately evacuated from the supermarkets so as to ensure they are not further displayed and sold to consumers, adding that the unwholesome products would be destroyed. She said that compliance notices were issued pursuant to the provision of section 4(a) of the Consumer Protection Agency law with a view to protect against the marketing of goods which are hazardous to life Continuing, she said that the agency observed that some traders in the local markets, shops, retail outlets supermarkets and even the multi chain stores are taking advantage of the festive period to sell unwholesome products at ridiculously low prices to consumers. She stressed that the agency will not relent in the actualisation of its mandate to ensure that consumers in Lagos State are protected and get value for their money. The agency further reiterated the need for consumers to develop a culture of patiently checking the details on every product, particularly consumables before making purchases. The GM therefore urged Lagosians not to hesitate to forward complaints to the agency on any unwholesome product displayed for sale in any shop or when their rights as consumers are infringed.
