Kaduna State Police Command said yesterday that it had arrested two cattle rustlers, who also engaged in kidnapping in Buruku village, Birnin Gwari Local Government. Police Commissioner Malam Ahmad Abdulrrahaman made the disclosure at a press briefing in Kaduna. He said a combined team of police and vigilance groups nabbed the suspects after a gun battle at Buruku forest. Abdulrrahaman said the criminals fled and abandoned 55 cows and nine sheep. “The police, however, arrested two suspects and recovered the animals. “At present, 12 of the recovered cattle have been identified by the owners. Buhari Mohammed from Buruku identified six cows, while Mustapha Lawal from Mando identified two cows and Hassan Umar from Mai-Daro identified four cows. He said the remaining 43 cows and nine sheep are still with the police awaiting legitimate claims from the rightful owners. The CP said people, whose animals have been rustled, should come forward with proof of ownership. He assured the public that the case of culpable homicide of a commercial motorcyclist in Kafanchan has no religious undertones. “This issue is capable of causing reprisals in the state. For those who care to know, the issue is not a religious issue, it is a criminal issue. “The motorcyclist was carrying a passenger to Anguwar Masara. Immediately he entered the area, some criminals attacked and killed him and took away the motorcycle. “The motive was just criminal; it has nothing to do with his religion. “The victim is a Christian by name Micah Yakubu from Bebeji Local Government Area of Kano State. “I have directed the Police Area Commander to go after the killers, we will apprehend them and prosecute them,” Abdulrrahaman said.
