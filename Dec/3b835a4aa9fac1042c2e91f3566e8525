The University of Ilorin says it has constituted a committee to look into the modalities for the enforcement of a dress code for members of staff and students of the institution. Dr Rasheed Jimoh, the Dean of the Faculty of Communication and Information Sciences (CIS) made this known in a statement made available to newsmen in Ilorin. Jimoh noted that the faculty would rely on the contributions and commitment of members of the committee toward ensuring total compliance with the university’s dress code, to guard against indecent dressing on campus. The don said that the committee had earlier held its inaugural meeting, where members expressed commitment to achieving the objectives of the code. According to him, various strategies have been mapped out to ensure the success of the committee’s assignment. “The committee, however, charged all staff and students to always abide by the rules and regulations governing dressing on campus as sanctions will be applied on erring staff and students,” the don said. According to the statement, the committee is to be chaired by Dr Abiodun Olawoyin of the Department of Telecommunications Sciences. Other members include; Mr Mustafa Abubakar of the Directorate of Corporate Affairs as Secretary and Dr Rasaq Adisa of the Department of Mass Communication among others. NAN
