No fewer than 200 youths from Anambra State have been presented with cash sum and tools by the West African Youth Support and Development Forum (WAYSDF). The youth group also visited selected government hospitals in Onitsha and environs where they offset medical bills of 14 youths. Presenting cheques and other items to the beneficiaries in Ogidi on Saturday, the President of the group, Mr. Afam Akonanya, said the gesture was in line with the aims and objectives of the organization. He said the forum was formed to empower West African youths through education, engagement in community development and sports. He said, “West African Youth Support and Development Forum is an NGO established to support and empower youths as a way of affecting their lives positively. “African youths travel overseas in search of greener pastures because of dearth of opportunities in Africa. “What we’re striving to achieve is to support the African youth, empower him and help him to love Africa, live Africa and contribute to the development of Africa. “The vision is to ensure that West African youths become empowered leaders with skills and confidence to actively develop themselves and their families.” One of the beneficiaries Abubakar Rashidi, who received a cheque of N150,000, promised to convert the gifts to tools that would transform his life and place him on the part of greatness.
