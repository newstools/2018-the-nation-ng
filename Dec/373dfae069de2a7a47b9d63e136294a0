The Ogun State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Mrs. Modupe Mujota, has said the state has developed a policy which would ensure that all youths and adults achieve literary and proficiency by 2030. She added that the state state intends to empower adults and youths to be relevant in meeting the challenges of their immediate environment and the society at large. The commissioner spoke at a programme organised by the government to mark the 2018 International Literacy Day, themed: “Literacy and Skills Development”, held at Remo Secondary School, Sagamu. She noted that the move was in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 4 target 6 of UNESCO. Mrs. Mujota added that findings have shown that about 750 million people worldwide still lack basic literacy skills while 192 million unemployed worldwide were unable to find decent livelihood due to lack of foundational skills, including literacy, and failing to meet the skill demands of the rapidly changing labour market. According to her, the statistics obtained from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) indicated further that two-third of the population are women and 102 million are youths between the ages of 15 and 24. State Director, Agency for Mass Education Dr. Abdulwaheed Olanloye praised the government for her huge investment in skills development, noting that this has increased the level of literacy from 87.5 per cent to 90.7 per cent between year 2011 and 2017. The target of the Agency, Olanloye added, is to create awareness to unreached youths and adults, enjoining them to enroll for various skills acquisition programmes of the agency in all centres across the state.
