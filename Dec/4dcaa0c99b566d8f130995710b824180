The former military president welcomed Buhari to the club of ‘Over 75’ while congratulating him for all the achievements he has recorded in his lifetime. In a letter personally signed by the former leader, he congratulated Buhari for attaining the new age and for his excellent qualities as the president at this time. “As we get over our mid-seventies, we can say with all sense of modesty that we should celebrate every birthday with prayers in order for us to thank Allah for all the blessings and the bounties He showered upon us. “It is only fair that we pause and reflect in our own different ways on all the life’s challenges we face day by day and the positive strides we have been blessed to attain. “I join the first lady, Aisha, and all your children and grandchildren in wishing you many happy returns of your birthday. Aisha’s loyalty and support, as the home front commander, is invigorating since by our age we require much comfort, care and affection at home. Welcome to our club of over 75.” He congratulated the president for being an excellent role model to young aspiring politicians due to the way and manner he has managed to sustain the survival of our country as an indivisible one nation in the face of many daunting diversions.
