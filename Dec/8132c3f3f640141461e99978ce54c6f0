Arsenal attacker, Alex Iwobi has declared that the Gunners will work hard to recover fast from their 2-3 loss to Southampton, as he believes they can go on another unbeaten run. Footballlive.ng reports that Iwobi admitted it was disappointing seeing the Gunners’ long run in all competitions ended by The Saints, with a 3-2 scoreline on Sunday, but the Super Eagles’ star insists his team will dust themselves up very quickly and try to go on another run, as they host Tottenham Hotspur in the Carabao Cup tomorrow Charlie Austin’s late goal ensured Ralph Hasenhuttl picked up a crucial first win as Saints’ boss. Iwobi admitted Arsenal lacked concentration against Southampton and lamented his side’s lacklustre performance. Iwobi: “Southampton deserves credit. They had a game plan and they stuck to it, but it’s disappointing by us. We weren’t focused through the 90 minutes. There were spells where we didn’t defend well as a team. “We’re frustrated the unbeaten run is over. We had chances to win the game. But we should give ourselves some credit for going on the run. Now we have to keep going and try to go on another run.”
