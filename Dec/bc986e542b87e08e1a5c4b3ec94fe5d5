Watches at the ongoing Ladies European Tour’s Lalla Aicha Tour School finals holding in Morocco, are getting tougher as Nigeria’s Georgia Oboh is in contention to finish amongst the top 25 at the prestigious tournament. As Nigeria’s flagbearer, the Edo State-born golfer is currently competing against 114 of golfers across the world as the battle for places in the top 25 gets hots up in the second day of the competition. The 17-year-old golf sensation is on the edge of history as she aims to become the first Nigerian to qualify to play in any Ladies European Tour (LET) in the advent she makes the top 25 at the end of the competition. A total of 115 players are battling it out over five rounds and are expected to play at both Amelkis Golf Club and Palm Golf Ourika twice before playing the final round at Amelkis Golf Club on Thursday, December 20. Following 90 holes, the leading five players will earn Category 5c membership of the LET, meaning that they will gain entry into most tournaments, while those in positions 6-25 will earn membership in Category 8. Players who make the cut but finish in positions 26 or lower may still join the LET in Category 9b. On the first day of the tournament, Astha Madan from India fired a flawless seven-under-par 65 to take a one-stroke lead on the opening day of the finals in Morocco. The 22-year-old from Gurgaon had a clean scorecard featuring two birdies on the front nine and five on the back at Amelkis Golf Club in Marrakesh, to sit one clear of Lauren Horsford from England. Spaniard Maria Hernandez, Ireland’s Leona Maguire, English pair Sian Evans and Dulcie Sverdloff, Frenchwoman Manon Gidali and Esther Henseleit from Germany are all on four-under-par in the chase to earn playing rights on tour next season. Madan didn’t even know she was bogey-free until after the round and thought that her score would have been “around five-under.”
