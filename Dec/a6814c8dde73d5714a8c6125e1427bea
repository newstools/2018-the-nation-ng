The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has established 13 more state offices. The Executive Secretary of the commission, Tony Ojukwu, who disclosed this at an event jointly organised in Yola by the commission and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR), said the new offices were opened to take the commission to every state as the commission hitherto had offices in 23 states. “Every state now has a state office as against 23 before. This year we established 13, so we have 13 new offices as I talk to you now, so that we can be close to more Nigerians and ensure that their rights are protected,” Mr Ojukwu said during an interaction with newsmen after the opening ceremony of the ‘End of Year Review/Training Meeting of the ‘NHRC/UNHCR IDP/Returnees Protection Monitoring Project,’ which was held in the Adamawa State capital. Ojukwu said the commission decided to open the new offices to have effective representation in every state despite financial constraints because most of the people the commission serves are those of limited financial resources who need to be able to reach the commission with minimal travel expenses. The NHRC executive secretary explained that the NHRC/UNHCR 2018 IDPs/Returnees Protection Monitoring Project Review was meant to scrutinize the impact of the project in the course of 2018 in its three coverage states of Adamawa, Yobe and Borno, and to make recommendations that could improve the project in the coming year. He said the 2018 IDP Protection Monitoring Project which commenced in January, had been aimed at protecting and promoting human rights and providing humanitarian assistance for IDPs in the three project states.
