Until 27 years ago, Idris Jimoh Ajibaye, 69, was independent. He could feed his family of five, pay school fees and even take his family out in his Peugeot 504 car. All these  stopped when he lost his sight in 1991. He said he became blind when he went to take his tipper out for work. As soon as I entered the tipper and switched on the engine , my sight left me. I was supposed to go and load sharp sand, I had not gotten to the place, but I just couldn’t see anymore. “I never had any problem with my sight until that fateful morning. After losing my sight , I started visiting  hospitals, herbalists, mosques and churches to see if I could get it back until the sight was restored again and I started  to  drive. But on  August 17, 1999,  I lost the right eye  again and I became completely blind till today.” Ajibaye said on the day he lost  his sight the  second time, he had delivered sand at the Teslim Balogun Stadium  three times and was preparing for his fourth trip when he noticed that he couldn’t see anymore. ”I used to have two tippers and a car. I bought my first tipper in 1986 and the second in 1993, but right now, I don’t have anything. Donations can be sent to his First Bank account 3061524502 with the name, Idris Jimoh Ajibaye.
