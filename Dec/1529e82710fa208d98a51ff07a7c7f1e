Information and Culture Minister Lai Mohammed said on Friday that the 2019 budget proposal submitted to the National Assembly on Wednesday by President Muhammadu Buhari is the best the federal government could offer. Mohammed told State House Correspondents in Abuja that it is now up to the national Assembly to consider the proposal. Asked by reporters to respond to comments by Senate President  Bukola Saraki that the budget proposal holds no hope for Nigerians,the minister said: “It is not the practice of the executive to be exchanging words with the legislative arm of government. “They are independent, we are independent.But to the best of our knowledge, we presented a budget given the circumstances of our resources this year. “We feel that is the best we can. It is left for the National Assembly to consider it.” The minister also noted that the Buhari administration has delivered on its promises to Nigerians. “We are happy that we have been able to meet all our promises, all our obligations to Nigerians. “And as the year rolls out, we are more determined to even to deliver more to Nigerians.” The minister, who briefed Buhari on the activities of his ministry, said he made a portrait of the President in five major Nigerian attires, “one is in Yoruba, Hausa, Igbo, Efik and one in suit. “It is reminiscent of the portrait we use during this campaign.”
