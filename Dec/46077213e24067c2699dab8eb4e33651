Jose Mourinho is back in London and says he will return to management after he took a stroll the day after being sacked by Manchester United. His tumultuous two-and-a-half year spell at Old Trafford came to an end on Tuesday, and he has returned to the family home having stayed in the Lowry Hotel during his time in Manchester. Mourinho was approached by Sky Sports News as he walked down the street, but he was initially not in the mood to discuss his future in management. Asked about his next move, Mourinho said: ‘No, you know me. You know me. Let me walk. I have nothing to say. You know me, if you want to walk with me then let’s walk to Battersea. I have nothing to say.’ He looked unimpressed to be disturbed on his stroll, pulling a face to Sports mail’s cameraman before his rather disengaged interview with Sky’s reporter. Mourinho later went into more details, having apparently made a trip to Harrods, as he returned home carrying a shopping bag from the department store. He said his time with United is ‘in the past’ and that he did not want to dwell on his sacking, and instead look forward to a return to coaching. Mourinho said: ‘Manchester United has a future without me and I have a future without them. Why should I be sharing more now? Even with the supporters, any of my feelings. It’s over. That’s the way I’ve always been. ‘I’ve been critical of managers that speak about details about what’s happened and who is to blame. That’s not me. I just want to finish like it happened yesterday and I’d like to say it’s game over. I just hope you media respect this way for me to be. ‘Until I get back to football I think I have my right to live my life as I do now. That’s what I want to do. Manchester United is in the past.’
