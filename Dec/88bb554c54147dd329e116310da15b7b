 The 2018 world Cup in Russia may have come and gone but the financial blessing from it is still rolling in. Premier league clubs Enyimba and Ifeanyi Ubah are to pocket $118,860 N42.7million each for having their one and only player Ikechukwu  Ezenwa at the world cup. Ezenwa it will be recalled was the only player from the local league that made Coach Gernot Rohr’s 23-man squad to Russia where Nigeria failed to go beyond the group stage. While the Nigeria professional football league could boast of just one player, the Tunisian league and Egyptian leagues respectively provided more players thus earning more. Formidable clubs like Zamalek, Ah Ahly, Club Africain, Esperance, Etoile sportive known for making waves in the continent all earned millions of dollars for parading local players. Prior to the world cup the need to include more of the local players in the team for exposure and blend took the center stage among fans and analysts alike in Nigeria, but the national coach stood his ground. In a recent interview however the German tactician said the local league players remain in his plan adding that his assistants have been mandated to keep track of the players doing well in their clubs with a view to giving them a chance prove their skills in the national team especially ahead of the 2019 Nations cup and the 2022 World cup in Qatar respectively.
