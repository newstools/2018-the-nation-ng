A 39-year-old man and father of four has committed suicide by drinking poisonous substances at Edepie, Yenagoa, Bayelsa State. The deceased was identified as Femi Otura, a truck driver, from Kogi State, married to an indigene of Bayelsa State. His wife, Mrs. Ovieizibe Femi, who is nursing their fourth child, was reportedly away with the other children when her husband took his life. The neighbours said the deceased was always drunk, and came back midnight after a bout of drinking. He was said to have started screaming, and when neighbours opened his door his body was found beside a bottle of poisonous substance. The landlord, Mr. Philips Akpuzere, confirmed the development, saying he led other tenants to open the deceased door. He said: “The deceased is a truck driver but recently lost his job, and on this fateful day he looked very unusual and was wearing a moody countenace all day. “He came back around 1am on Tuesday morning and he entered his apartment; we started hearing screaming from his apartment. We were suprised because he was the only one at home as his wife, who just put to bed, had gone to her mother’s place with the other children. “When the screaming persisted, I raised the alarm and other tenants came out to join me to forcefully open the door where we met him dead. “We saw an empty bottle with some liquid beside him. We call a doctor who lives in the neighbourhood who confirmed him dead. We contacted the police who took the body to the morgue.”
