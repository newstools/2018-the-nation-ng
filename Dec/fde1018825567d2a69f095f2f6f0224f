Super Eagles’ striker, Victor Osimhen’s agent is fit for his side’s weekend’s clash at Zulte Waregem in the Belgium Pro League, AOIFootball.com can authoritatively confirm. The Nigerian was taken off doing the closing stages of his side’s 2-0 win over Gent after he collided with Anderson Esiti which led to his being substituted. The club then twitted after the match that the Nigerian may be missing in action for some time but further scans on the player showed it was just a knock and he should be fit for their next game on Sunday. The player’s agent also confirmed his availability to AOIFootball.com, stressing that it was just a precautionary substitution and nothing more than that. The 19-year-old has been a revelation since making the switch from Wolfsburg to Sporting Charleroi on loan and has already scored 8 goals in just 11 league starts, placing him as the club’s top scorer this season. His goal-scoring exploits has already led to several clubs vying for his signature but the player has maintained he will remain in Belgium until the end of the season.
