Greenife Pharmaceuticals Limited has commenced the donation of free exercise books to secondary school pupils in all Local Government Areas across Lagos State. The first phase of the project which kicked off last Friday in Surulere Local Government Area saw officials of Greenlife Pharmaceuticals donating thousands of exercise books to pupils of Ansar-Udeen High School, Falolu and Obele Community Senior Secondary School. Other schools included Gbaja Girls Secondary School and the New Era Girls Secondary School. Addressing officials and pupils, Mr Folabi Olusola who spoke on behalf of the management of Greenlife said the donation was Greenlife’s modest contribution to the educational growth of the pupils as good corporate citizens. “It is our corporate belief that children’s education is a general responsibility of the whole community and should not be left for parents or government alone,” he said. In her speech, the special guest of honour, Chief Lateefat Gbajabiamila thanked Greenlife for the laudable initiative.  She also urged the pupils “not to turn the exercise books donated to you to scrap books but you should use them judiciously.” Vice Principal, Ansar-Udeen School, Mr S.O. Faleti, also thanked the firm. “Your worthy example at Greenlife Pharmaceuticals is worthy of emulation by other corporate organisations in the country,” he said.
