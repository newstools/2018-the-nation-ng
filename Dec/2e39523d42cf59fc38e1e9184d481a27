Following a bloody attack on Tse- Ibor and Tse- Dzungwe communities by suspected herdsmen on Friday, the bodies ofÂ  four Tiv farmers have been recovered. The corpses of late Samuel Dwem and Samuel Ukever were hurriedly buried. The other two were in bad shapes and could not be buried and was left in the bush. Since 2013, the communities have suffered several attacks from herdsmen. Leader of the search party, Tyovenda Gbumsy, told The Nation at Ayilamo town, headquarters of Tombo ward, that the herdsmen butchered late Kondom, removed fuel from his motor cycle and set him ablaze. He called on the Federal government to protect farmers in Tombo ward who have been under attacked since 2013. He added that residents of the communities have fled their homes and are now taking refuge in Ayilamo. A community leader, Uke Dzungwe, while speaking with The Nation, warned that if nothing is done by security agency and federal government, food crisis would hit the entire area as farmers can no longer go to their farms for fear of being attacked or even killed while herdsmen and their cows are destroying yet to be harvested crops across the area.
