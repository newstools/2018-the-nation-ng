A Medical expert, Dr Mosun Adeoye, has advised Nigerians to imbibe good eating habits in order to have a healthy lifestyle. Adeoye told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Ilorin on Wednesday that abnormal feeding habits could bring about severe consequences. She said that such consequences include malnutrition, chronic depression and ailing body, among others. The medical expert noted that poor nutrition had negative effect, especially on children as they developed physically and psychologically. “Critical growth periods need special nutrition. So if a child is not well fed with the right food items, so many things can happen to the child. “There is likely to be stunted growth, chronic medical problems, inadequate bones and muscle growth and lack of neurological development. “The effect of this is that the brain will be negatively affected in its functioning and information processes. “Such children will find it difficult to understand social relationships and academic tasks, ‘’ Adeoye said. She noted that it was safer to invest more in meals to be consumed to avoid unnecessary hospital bills. “We should try to take heed of the advice because one may think that eating well is costly. “By adopting a better diet and a wiser lifestyle, you can live longer and enjoy a healthier and more productive life. “Try as much as possible to include fruits and vegetables in your diet as these go a long way to help,’’ Adeoye said.
