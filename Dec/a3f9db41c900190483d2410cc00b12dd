Lagos West senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Olamilekan Adeola (aka Yayi), has promised to raise a motion compelling the Electricity Distribution Companies (DISCOs) to provide their customers across the country with prepaid meters. The motion would end the estimated billing. The senator said any DISCO that refuses to meter Nigerians should not expect revenue. “We shall empower Nigerians to resist the payment of any estimated bills from any DISCO,” Adeola said. He said the Senate would not fold its hands while those who bought the nation’s national assets continue to fleece Nigerians. The senator spoke at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Lagos Council’s Meet the Press Forum at the council secretariat in Ikeja, the state capital. The senator kick-started his second term re-election campaign at the event. He said Nigerians looked forward to quality representation from its representatives. Adeola, whose senatorial district has the largest population of 14 million people, also promised to champion the media enhancement bill that would raise the welfare of media practitioners in the country. Rendering account of his stewardship, the senator said he had sponsored 15 bills out of which two had been assented to by the President, and carried out several empowerment programmes, ranging from scholarship, the purchase of JAMB/UTME admission forms to indigent students as well as empowerment and skills acquisition programmes for thousands of his constituents.
