Borno State Governor Kashim Shettima and his Kaduna State counterpart, Mallam Nasir El-Rufai, are due in Ekiti State today for the reconciliation of party leaders and members still aggrieved by the outcome of the national and state legislative primaries. The National Working Committee (NWC) of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) raised the panel, called the APC Southwest National Peace and Reconciliation Committee, to resolve issues arising from the primaries. Shettima is the chairman of Ekiti panel. Other members are: El-Rufai, Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode, former Senate President Ken Nnamani, former Ekiti State Deputy Governor Prof. Modupe Adelabu and the Director General of Nigeria Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), Dr Dakuku Peterside. The committee will sit at the Ekiti State Government House in Ado-Ekiti and hold parleys in Ondo and Oyo states. The national and state legislative primaries were conducted by a five-man committee, led by Dr. Ibrahim Sule. Speaking yesterday ahead of the Shettima panelâ€™s arrival, Ekiti APC Chairman Paul Omotoso urged members to allow peace to reign to enable the party to win all seats in the 2019 polls. According to him, the local chapter of the party had gone far in persuading some of the aggrieved aspirants to sheathe their swords.
