Nollywood actress Gloria Mba is raising funds for St Jude Children’s Research Hospital. It is to commerate her birthday-which was December 19. Asking for support to meet her goal, the mother of one writes on her Facebook. “For my birthday this year, I’m asking for donations to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital. I’ve chosen this nonprofit because their mission means a lot to me, and I hope you’ll consider contributing as a way to celebrate with me. Every little bit will help me reach my goal. I’ve included information about St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital below. “Families never receive a bill from St. Jude for treatment, travel, housing or food – because all a family should worry about is helping their child live. Treatments invented at St. Jude have helped push the overall childhood cancer survival rate from 20% to more than 80% since it opened more than 50 years ago. St. Jude is working to drive the overall survival rate for childhood cancer to 90%, and we won’t stop until no child dies from cancer. St. Jude freely shares the discoveries we make, and every child saved at St. Jude means doctors and scientists worldwide can use that knowledge to save thousands more children”. She also added, I don’t know how to thank you Eze mo,obi n’igwe…You have been awesome all the way …even in my shortcomings,you kept showing me your awesomeness. Almost lost my life 14th of December just 5days to my birthday but you told me it wasn’t time yet,that you were not done with me. Kai Papa you have held me and took me gently even in my baby steps you were patient with me. All I have seen this year has been overwhelming”.
