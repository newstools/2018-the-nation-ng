The two siblings, Nadia Mutana, six, and her brother, Khalifa, three, allegedly kidnapped by their housemaid on November 26, have been found, The Nation learnt yesterday. They were allegedly kidnapped by the housemaid when she went to pick them from school. It was gathered that the maid, simply identified as Busayo, fled with the children barely eight days after she was employed. The victims’ father, Aneru Mutana, said they were found in the wee hours of yesterday in Benin Republic, close to Seme border. He declined to state if any ransom was paid. Lagos Police Command spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), said Busayo is a member of a kidnap syndicate. He said: “On November 26, Busayo was instructed by Mrs. Mutana to pick her children from school and take them home, as she (Mrs. Mutana) wasn’t able to do so due to the nature of her job. “Unfortunately, the housemaid had planned how to kidnap the children and executed her wicked plan effortlessly because she is known to the school authorities and familiar with the children. “Investigation showed that Busayo is a member of a kidnap syndicate, who gives her out as a maid to unsuspecting parents. “When she finally lands the job, she worms her way into the children’s heart and wins the trust of her employers. Once she gets to this stage, she bares her fangs. “Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal warns households interested in engaging domestic servants to beware of who they are dealing with. “He reiterates his earlier warning that employers ought to carry out a background check of persons they are bringing to their homes and profile them in order to make investigation easy for the police, should the need arise. “The command believes that Busayo may not be her real name. However, it wishes that Nigerians should take cognisance of her face and alert the nearest police formation of her location and if possible, apprehend and hand her over to the police.”
