The United States of America has assured it will deliver the 12 units of Super Tucano aircraft ordered by the Federal Government on time. The Director of the US Air Force Security Assistance and Cooperation (AFSAC) Brig. Gen. Sean Farrell said everything would be done to deliver the aircrafts on schedule to enable Nigeria step up the fight against terrorism. He spoke during a visit to the Nigerian Air Force (NAF) headquarters in Abuja. Farrell, according to the spokesman for the NAF, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, is one of the officers overseeing the ongoing process of the procurement of the A-29 Supper Tucano aircraft. Daramola, in a statement in Abuja, said an American delegation of which Farrell was a member was in the country to discuss the delivery schedule of the aircraft and construction of a base to keep the aircraft. He said the delegation expressed its readiness to complete the execution of the contract in record time, noting the visit to the Base would provide the team with firsthand knowledge of the construction site as well as help avoid delays in schedule and risks in the future.
