The Osun State government is planning an economic summit in the first quarter of next year. The state’s Statistician-General, Prof. Wasiu Alagbe Gbolagade, announced this at a business programme organised by Kazeem International Group of Schools, Agbowo in Iwo. He said the summit would attract many investors from all over the world. The statistician-general noted that the summit is dear to the Gboyega Oyetola administration because it will bring together high-level leaders from businesses, governments, civil society groups and the academia to explore how to collectively shape policies for inclusive growth and harness the next Industrial Revolution. Gbolagade said: “The State of Osun Economic Summit will be an opportunity for participants to provide input and gain insights through the lens of these System Initiatives. At the summit, some of them will be highlighted in sessions dedicated to the issues at hand. The Summit will address key issues of the Local Government, Senatorial District and the importance of State of Osun.”
