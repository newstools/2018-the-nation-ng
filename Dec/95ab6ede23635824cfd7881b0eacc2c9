Niger Woods features in Forbes Magazine’s ‘America’s Wealthiest Celebrities 2018’ list with his current net worth at $800m. Star Wars creator George Lucas tops the list with $5.4bn, with Woods in 9thplace alongside author James Patterson. Woods returned to the PGA Tour in 2018 after fourth back surgery last April and was arguably the story of the golfing year. The 14-time major won again and had strong showings in the year’s final two majors, with a T6 at The Open, where he had the lead at the halfway stage, and a runner-up finishes at the USPGA. His 2018 season was lucrative on the course, with winnings of just under $5.5m, whilst his net worth rose by $50m for the year. It now stands at $800m and he is by far the richest professional golfer on the planet, with Phil Mickelson in second with an estimated current net worth of $375m. Woods was one of just two athletes in Forbes’ America’s Wealthiest Celebrities 2018 list, with basketball star Michael Jordan up in 4th with a net worth of $1.7bn. The 80-time PGA Tour winner’s company TGR – Tiger Woods Ventures appears to be going well and he has plenty of revenue streams including sponsorships with Nike, TaylorMade, Bridgestone, Hero, the PGA Tour, Kowa, Full Swing and Upper Deck. He has also recently signed a deal with new streaming platform GOLF TV to produce content and was involved in ‘The Match’ with Phil Mickelson which was on Pay-Per-View.
