A Cleric, Rev. Abraham Okunade, has urged Christians to reflect on the reason for the season and the teachings of the Holy Bible, show love and ensure peaceful co-existence. Okunade, the Chaplain of Gray International College, Osogbo, made the call on Saturday in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). He said many people are caught up in Christmas celebrations each year, but do they really understand the truth about the season. Okunade said Christmas is a period for self-assessment using the Bible teachings of Jesus Christ as the yardstick. According to him, Christians celebrate the miracle of the birth of Christ every Dec. 25, to express joy at the wonders Jesus’ coming has brought to the world. “It is day set aside to mark the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ and no matter the circumstances; Christians must show His virtues of love and peace during the season. “It is a moment to pray for Osun and the country at large and also show kindness to the less privileged by sharing gifts as shown in the Bible when the three wise men came to visit Jesus when he was born, ” Okunade said. The cleric urged Christians to make out time this season to visit the hospitals, prisons and orphanage homes to show those in such places that there was always a reason to thank God. He said presenting gifts to them, as well as preaching the word of God, would go a long way in wiping away their tears and strengthening their faith in God and the gospel. Okunade then appealed to all Nigerians irrespective of their faith, to pray fervently for the country as it prepared for the 2019 General Elections that Nigeria would experience the most peaceful, credible, free and fair polls.
