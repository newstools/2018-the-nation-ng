Chief Judge of Edo State, Justice Esohe Frances Ikponmwen, has warned lawyers against perpetuating injustice by being oppressive in the way the processes of court are used. Justice Ikponmwen said it was wrong for lawyers to deliberately delay case of their client when they know that there is no truth in the claim. Speaking on Saturday at the annual Nigeria Bar Association, Benin Branch dinner, Justice Ikponmwen reminded lawyers that their duty was not only to the court or client but also to the greater cause of justice. Ikponmwen stated that lawyers have to abide by the rules of court and appealed to them to embrace the services of the multi-door court house for the purpose of achieving quick dispensation of justice. According to her, “I am glad that legal practitioners in Edo State are rising up to the challenge for the improvement of our justice delivery system which informed the new Civil Procedure Rules for Edo State. “There is no need for apprehension as it is my view that once quick dispensation of justice is achieved, many persons will be willing to approach courts to redress wrongs which are prevalent in this society but overload because of lack of trust in our justice system.” Among those conferred with the NAB awards were Justice Ikpomwen, Justice Ada Ehigiamusoe, Ken E. Mozia, Edo State Commissioner of Police, Mr. Johnson Babatunde Kokumo, Barr. Osarodion Ogie, Senator Mathew Uroghide, Hon Patrick Obahiagbon amongst others.
