A 39-year-old businesswoman, Shodiyan Bisoye, was yesterday brought before a Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly issuing N4.1 million dud cheque to an investment company. Bisoye, who lives at Iyana Oba, Lagos, was said to have  issued the dud cheque to Virtue One Global Investment Ltd. Prosecutor Roman Unuigbe said the accused committed the offence on September 29, 2017, at Block 2, Flat 6, Iba Housing Estate, Iyana Oba. He alleged that the accused collected a loan from the firm  to invest in her business and later issued the dud cheque for repayment of the loan. Unuigbe said the cheque was dishonoured when presented for payment because of insufficient funds in the account. The accused pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Peter Ojo granted her N500,000 bail   with two sureties in the like sum. He said the sureties, who must be employed, must live within the court’s jurisdiction and show evidence of three years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. The case continues on January 9.
