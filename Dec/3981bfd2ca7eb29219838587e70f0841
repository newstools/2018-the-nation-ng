Residents of Igbogbo Baiyeku in Ikorodu, Lagos yesterday protested at the Lagos State House of Assembly. They complained that the government had not compensated them for their demolished houses. The protesters carried placards with the inscriptions: “We say no to selective payment,” “Please pay our compensation as promised”, among others. Addressing the protesters, Majority Leader Sanai Agunbiade representing Ikorodu 1 said development always comes with pains, adding that the demolition followed reconstruction of roads. The lawmaker, who hailed the protesters for their peaceful conduct, promised that the government, in conjunction with the House of Assembly, would look into the matter. He assured them that the matter would be presented to Speaker Mudashiru Obasa, promising that the government would pay those yet to be compensated.
