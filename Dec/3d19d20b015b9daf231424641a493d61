 The Nigeria Electricity System Operator of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) on Monday said that it generated 4,176 Mega Watts (MW) at 06:00 hour of Sunday. The daily report of the TCN added to it generated 4,124mw at the same time in the previous day. The Nigeria Electricity Supply Industry (NESI) is still tagging behind optimum utilization of its capacity because of several constraints, said the daily report of Friday November 30, 2018 of the weekend report of the General Manager, National Control Centre, Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN). Meanwhile, at 06:00 hours of Saturday, the Nigeria Electricity System Operator of the Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) daily report said that the electricity market recorded 4,124MW energy generation. Whereas the electricity market, according to the report, has a maximum available  capacity of 7,652.6 (MW), what it sent out on Friday was 3,910.40 mw, an indication of un-utilized 3,742.2mw on the day under review. The report however blamed the loss to some capability of units on bar. It spelt out that Kainji hydro, which has eight installed units only has four units available. Instead of generating 420mw, it produced 346mw on the day under review. The report, however,  said that 1G7 unit of the Kainji Hydro station, was “out on stator winding winding failure. 1G8-Out due to oil leakage on governor runner head. 1G9-out due to burnt 7.5MVA 330/415Kv &183.6MVA 16/330KV station service transformer and generator transformer. 1G10-shut down due to thrust bearing temperature problem.” In Jebba hydro, said the report, there are six installed units but the five that were functional on Friday generated 450mw instead of 476mw.  The shortfall was blamed on the “2G6- Out due to burnt generator winding and AVR. 411G3- Out on fault.” The report noted that the Shiroro Hydro, which has four units and has installed capacity of 450mw generated  420mw. Besides, the report said most of plants were out of service owing to gas constraint. It said that the Delta gas plant that has 18 units and 545mw capacity, generated 460mw, stressing that “GT2-Tripped on transformer differential lockout. GT3 $5 -Out due to generator winding fault. GT4-out of loss of excitation. GT6, 8 & 14- Out on major overhaul. GT17-Tripped on bearing vibration more than maximum . GT18-out due to generator lockout problem. Generation reduced due to gas constraint.” There were also forced outages owing to transmission issues. The report said “12:01- 12:41hrs, Ikeja West/Sakete 330kv line (cct NWIBS) CB tripped at Ikeja West on the following relay indications: Siprotec Relay: General trip, Red, Yellow &Blue Phases, fault, Backup O/C/STUB, operated, 5X-BPU, IP Phase C time =545ms, trip time=490ms, distance= 54.7km. LHR=281mw.” The TCN report added that at 14:32-21:42Hrs, Ejigbo T/S 60MVA 132/33kv transformer T3 primary  CB tripped, shattered Blue Phase lightening arrester was observed. LHR= 22.6MW.”
