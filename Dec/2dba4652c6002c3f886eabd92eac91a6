To prepare workers for life out of service, the Lagos State Government is remitting money into their Retirement Savings Account (RSA), Establishments, Training and Pensions Commissioner Dr. Benson Oke said yesterday. Opening a retreat for trade union leaders from Lagos State, at the Michael Imoudu Institute in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital, he said many state governments did not see the need to prepare their employees for retirement. Lagos, he said, knew the importance of preparing workers for retirement by remitting money into their RSA. Oke said the union members enjoyed the privilege of having served establishments that made arrangements for their future in retirement, adding that the government had paid accrued pension rights running into billions of naira into its workers’ RSA. He said when employees and employers planned for retirement, the transformation would be less stressful. “While many employers of labour and indeed, many state governments do not see the need to prepare their employees for a new life, the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode administration is a people-oriented one and we have resolved that everyone who has worked diligently for the state has to be recognised, paid his/her entitlements and assisted to prepare for future challenges,” the commissioner said. He said there were challenges inherent in facing  retirement and advised trade union leaders and members not to be apprehensive about the challenges. Oke urged workers to envision a productive future in retirement. He advised union members to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the retreat to relax, meditate and plan for the challenges ahead.
