The Nigeria Police Force, Edo Command, yesterday reiterated the ban on sale of fireworks, also known as knockout and warned that offenders would be prosecuted. DSP Chidi Nwabuzor, the command’s spokesman, gave the warning in Benin. “The command warns sellers, buyers of fireworks, parents, guardians and children to desist from sale, purchase and use of fireworks before, during and after the Yuletide,’’ Nwabuzor said in a statement. He said this was because hoodlums might want to hide under the unwholesome practice to perpetrate their nefarious act. The spokesman said in view of this, there would be continuous manhunt for offenders, adding that offenders would be arrested and prosecuted accordingly. He noted that the Edo Commissioner of Police, Johnson Kokumo, had said that adequate measures had been put in place and operatives drafted to markets and other places of sale with a view to arresting dealers and buyers. Nwabuzor said the command remained committed and steadfast in its efforts at fighting crimes.
