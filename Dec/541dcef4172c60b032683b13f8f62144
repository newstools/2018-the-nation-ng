A Karmo Grade I Area Court, Abuja, on Tuesday, sentenced a 36-year- old man, Abdulahi Danjuma to two months imprisonment for breaking into a shop to steal groceries valued N5,000. Danjuma of NNPC quarters, was arraigned, tried and convicted after he pleaded guilty to the two- count- charge of house breaking and theft. The magistrate, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, who sentenced the convict, however, gave him an option to pay N5,000 fine. The prosecutor, Mrs Ukagha Ijeoma, had earlier told the court that one Isreal Abraham and Mohammed Sani of NNPC quarters, Abuja, on December 3, reported the matter at the Life Camp Police Station. Ijeoma alleged that the convict was caught after breaking into the shop of Sani and stole a pack of Vaseline, one roll of cowbell powdered milk and a crate of eggs, all valued N5, 000. She added that during police investigation, the roll of cowbell powdered milk was recovered but all efforts to recover the other items proved abortive. The prosecution said that the offences contravened the provisions of Sections 354 and 288 of the Penal Code. NAN
