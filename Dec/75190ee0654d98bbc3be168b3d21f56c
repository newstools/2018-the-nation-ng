Anybody who attacks officials of Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA) will, henceforth, face the music, its General Manager (GM), Adesina Tiamiyu, said yesterday. He spoke in the aftermath of an attack on some LASEMA officials at Obanikoro and Ejigbo. They were severely beaten by miscreants, with the phone and money of one of them, Dele Folarin, stolen. The LASEMA officials were responding to an emergency at Obanikoro when they were attacked. Tiamiyu said his men escaped being hurt at Ejigbo a few days ago, adding that the attackers smashed the windscreen of their vehicle. He warned that attacking emergency workers or destroying their vehicles was a heinous crime, adding that the police were on the look out for the perpetrators. Tiamiyu said the hoodlums would be fished out and punished to deter others. “This act is mostly perpetrated by some unscrupulous elements who do not have any role to play at the scene of the incident, but rather create pandemonium, thereby impeding the smooth operation of the emergency officers. “Emergency workers should be seen as friends. They come to give help to people in distress as well as salvage properties during emergencies. They should be allowed to carry out their duties without hindrance, to avoid loss of lives and property,” he said.
