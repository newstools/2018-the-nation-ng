Proscuting Assistant  police Superintendent of Police (ASP) Roman Unuigbe said the complainant, Mr. Anthony Lawani reported to the police that the body of his sister, Mary Ehinlaiye, 51, got missing from the mortuary. Unuigbe said: “The complainant went to the mortuary to collect his sister’s body for burial, but the attendants could not present it to him. “It was later discovered that they had exchanged the body for another one and the family of the other deceased had buried his sister as their own. “They secretly went to the mortuary, exchanged the bodies and tried to return her to her brother without two wrists and a heart. “Fortunately, Lawani discovered the missing parts and drew the attention of the police to the development.” The offence, the prosecutor said, contravened sections 165 (b) and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015.
