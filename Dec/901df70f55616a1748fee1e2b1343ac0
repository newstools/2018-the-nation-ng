A Karmo Grade 1 Area Court in the FCT yesterday sentenced a 28-year-old man, Ibrahim Hanuna, to five months’ imprisonment for stealing iron rods from a construction site. The judge, Alhaji Inuwa Maiwada, however, gave Hanuna an option of a N6, 000 fine. Maiwada warned the convict to desist from crime. Hanuna, of Jabi Garage, Abuja, had pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of criminal trespass and stealing and prayed for leniency. The prosecuting counsel, Mrs Ukagha Ijeoma, told the court that Suleiman Usman of the National Health Insurance Service, Utako, Abuja, reported the matter at the Utako Police Station on December 4. Ijeoma said on the same date, the convict criminally trespassed into the NHIS construction site at Jabi, without their consent. She told the court that the convict stole two iron rods, value yet unknown, from the site but he was caught immediately and handed over to the police. The prosecutor said the offences contravened sections 348 and 289 of the Penal Code and that the convict confessed to the crime.
