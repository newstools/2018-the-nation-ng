BEDC refutes fictitious information on license withdrawal message by EDOSCO Management of BEDC Electricity PLC (BEDC), has dispelled rumors by some Civil Societies Organization that its operating licence has been withdrawn. It urged its customers to disregard comments by the Civil Society groups asking them not to pay electricity bills based on the license withdrawal. A press statement issued to newsmen in Benin City and signed by its Head of Corporate Affairs, Mr. Adekunle Tayo, said the groups were peddling misinformation because the BEDC instituted court cases against some of it’s members for illegal tampering with power equipment. Tayo  noted that the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) which handles all matters relating to licensing, duly recognized BEDC as the electricity service provider for Edo, Delta, Ondo and Ekiti states. According to him, “After the licence renewal misinformation turned out to be a hoax, the groups have hbbeen looking for another avenue of smearing the corporate image of BEDC through deliberate falsehood and misinformation of the public especially customers. “BEDC therefore advises esteemed customers and good people of Edo state to disregard the false information being peddled by EDOSCO while advising customers to continue to pay their electricity bill in line with what is consumed”.
