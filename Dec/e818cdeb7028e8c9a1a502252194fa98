Commercial drivers in Cross River State State endorsed Governor Ben Ayade for a second term at the weekend. At a rally in Calabar, the state capital, the drivers, under the aegis of Unified Commercial Drivers Association of Cross River State, said they took the decision after assessing the candidates. Chairman of the association Pastor Thomas Effiom Okon said:  ”Our digital governor has achieved so much in three and a half years and therefore deserves a re-election. We as a body have come to a conclusion after due consultation that your programmes are laudable and deserve a pat on the back. Your second term is therefore, non- negotiable. We know you feel our pains;that is why we want to say thank you today for being there for us.” Ayade reiterated his determination to ensure that no one in the state lacked sustainable economic empowerment. “This is the reason for my government’s aggressive industrialisation drive. I am building the industries to create jobs, to empower the people. I used to drive taxi. I am one of you. This is where I started. I know your importance. “If   I was a full time politician, we will be owing salaries. I know my circumstances, I know my history.” The governor, who was made the grand patron of the association, announced that 120,000 new cars would be given  to the drivers to replace the rickety cabs, which “do not befit the status of Calabar as the tourism capital of Nigeria”. He announced the allocation of land to the association.
