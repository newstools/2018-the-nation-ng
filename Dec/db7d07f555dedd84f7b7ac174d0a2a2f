British Airways has said that its ‘On Business’ programme is a loyalty programme for savvy business travellers, which is available through free membership. Reiterating this at an ‘On Business’ event organized by the airline for Small and Medium Sized Entrepreneurs (SMEs) in Lagos at The Wheatbaker, Lagos, the airline said it is a smart way for businesses in Nigeria to manage their travel budgets. The loyalty programme offers members an option to choose either a discount on selected flights or earn points as they book eligible British Airways, American Airlines, Iberia and partner airline flights with a British Airways flight
number. According to Kola Olayinka, British Airways’ Regional Commercial Manager, West Africa,
“On Business was actually created for business owners who want to get more from traveling, and now travel can be more rewarding especially with the current economic situation in the country.” As a member of ‘On Business’, customers are assures of access
to exclusive member-only rewards and discounts, letting members
make the most of business travel budgets. Tunde Fawehinmi, Guaranty Trust Bank Manager, shared his personal recommendation for the On Business programme. He said, “The British Airways On Business programme has truly helped in managing the travel budgets which is a responsibility I’m in charge of at Guaranty Trust Bank.” Points on ‘On Business’ are redeemed against reward flights and upgrades, a simple
online tool that offers members an easier way to track spending and savings. At the event, Ogbemudia John Emunjeze of Agatha’s Interiors Design Ltd., emerged the winner of a British Airways Business Class return ticket.
