An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court  on Wednesday remanded two labourers in Kirikiri Prison  for allegedly stealing cow bones valued N1. 2 million and property of one Adedotun Ayodele. The defendants, Abubakar Abdullahi, 28, and Abdullahi Ibrahim, 22, were arraigned on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing before Chief Magistrate, Mrs S. K. Matepo. Prosecuting Police prosecutor, Sergeant Innocent Odugbo  told the court that the defendants committed the offence with others still at large on November 28, 2018 at about 1.30 a. m. at Abattior, Oko-Oba, Agege, Lagos. He said the defendants  brought sacks and loaded the bones into them. He said they were caught by a passer-by and were handed over to the police. Abdullahi and Ibrahim however pleaded guilty to the charge of conspiracy and denied the charge of stealing preferred against them by the Police. Chief Magistrate Matepo remanded the duo in Kirikiri Prisons, pending sentencing at the next date of adjournment. Matepo adjourned the case until December 12, 2018
