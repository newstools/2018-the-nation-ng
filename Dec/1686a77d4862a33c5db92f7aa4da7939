Movie production company, SAF Production, has launched its online and movie streaming platform, mysaftv.com. According to its management, the launch is informed by Nigerians’ need to demand quality and rich heritage production from movie production companies. The founder of the site, Crey Ahanonu, said  that the need to break the monopoly of Nollywood content cannot be over-stated. In his opinion, the few handling it have over the years diluted the content which invariably corrupted the cultural heritage. “Our story needs to be told by us and in our language,” he said. “We are the ones that can tell our stories better, and if we don’t, we will not have true and safe history. Our site is here to protect our heritage and leave history for generations to come.” He further added that the platform has special programmes for kids. MYSAFTV’s Lagos Representative, Ugochi ‘Graciouswoman’ Eboh said: “Tapes and compact discs (CD) are quickly becoming obsolete as advancement in media technology now means you can have all the entertainment you want at your fingertips and at a cheaper cost.”
