Manchester United and Arsenal have played out an entertaining 2-2 draw in Wednesday’s Premier League clash at Old Trafford. Arsenal twice led through goals from Shkodran Mustafi and Alexandre Lacazette, but Anthony Martial and Jesse Lingard earned a share of the spoils for the home side. Jose Mourinho’s side have now gone four games without a win and remain in eighth place in the standings, while Arsenal are down to fifth despite having extended their unbeaten run in the top flight to 13 matches. United started brightly in the North-West rain with Marcus Rashford forcing Bernd Leno into an early save from distance, but the home side failed to build on what had been an encouraging opening. Arsenal were not getting shots away at the other end but the Gunners were having plenty of joy down the left flank as Sead Kolasinac and Alex Iwobi overpowered youngster Diogo Dalot. The Gunners had slowly began to get on top and it came as little surprise when they took the lead, but their goal came as a result of a glaring error from David de Gea. Mustafi got away from his marker to sent a weak header towards goal and although De Gea got both hands to the German’s effort, the defender’s attempt found its way over the line after De Gea managed to fumble the ball behind him. However, it took United just four minutes to find an equaliser. Leno made a solid save to keep out Marcos Rojo’s free kick but Ander Herrera retrieved the ball to cross for Anthony Martial, who lashed a shot into the net from six yards out. Shots were few and far between for the remainder of the first half and after Rob Holding was forced off injured, five players picked up yellow cards in the space of 310 seconds for separate fouls.
