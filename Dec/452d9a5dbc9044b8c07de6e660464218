Senator Godswill Akpabio has described the inability of Senate President Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara to deliver their speeches during President Muhammadu Buhari’s budget presentation as a sign of weakness. He urged them to resign peacefully. Akpabio, in an interview with reporters shortly after Buhari presented the 2019 Appropriation Bill at the National Assembly in Abuja, said: “They really couldn’t talk because they shouldn’t be sitting on those seats since they now belong to a minority party. “When I was in the minority party, I was the minority leader; I wasn’t the Senate President. “So I will expect that what has happened today should be a wake up call on the Speaker and the Senate President to resign peacefully,” he said. On the rowdy session, he said such action was a characteristic of a parliament all over the world. “But you could also notice that the majority party, the APC, showed its strength. There was a lot of quietness; there was a lot of silence whenever the President was making key points. “The rest were just normal nuances of politics,” he said.
