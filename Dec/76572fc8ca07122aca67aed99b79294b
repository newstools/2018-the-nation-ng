. Use your teeth for the right purpose. That appears to be what the English FA is telling Derby County midfielder Bradley Johnson as he was handed a four game ban Friday for biting Stoke City’s Joe Allen The FA described the act as violent conduct that must attract punishment. The pair clashed after Stoke’s Oghenekaro Etebo was sent off in his side’s 2-1 victory on Wednesday, with TV replays suggesting Johnson sank his teeth into Allen’s shoulder. Johnson is also set to serve an additional game away from football, due to accumulating five cautions. An FA statement said: ‘Bradley Johnson has been suspended for four games after he was found to have committed an act of violent conduct for which the standard punishment would be clearly insufficient. ‘The Derby County player was involved in an incident with Stoke City’s Joe Allen during Wednesday’s game [28 November 2018] which was not seen by the match officials but caught on camera. ‘Johnson denied the charge of violent conduct with an Independent Regulatory Commission then considering The FA’s allegation that the three-match sanction should be increased. ‘In addition to the suspension for violent conduct, the player will also serve a one-match ban for accumulating five cautions.’ Following the match Allen had said Johnson had merely bitten his shirt but the FA said that after reviewing footage of the incident, the Derby player would face a trial by an Independent Regulatory Commission. Stoke manager Gary Rowett, who managed Johnson at Derby last season, tried to play down the incident following the initial charge. ‘We are not going to make any complaints,’ said Rowett. ‘I spoke to Joe and he said it wasn’t anything massively problematic. It was part of the melee, a moment in the game that probably looked worse than it was.’
