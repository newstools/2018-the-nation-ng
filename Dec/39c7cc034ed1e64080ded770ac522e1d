President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday night promised that All Progressives Congress (APC) men and women, who work hard for the party towards 2019 general elections will be rewarded adequately. He gave the assurance during the launch of the “TogetherNigeria Group” at the old Banquet Hall of the State House, Abuja. The group is supporting the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 election. The President regretted that not all those that worked for the party in 2015 were rewarded. He also thanked the Nigerian celebrities for laundering Nigeria’s image globally. He said: “Tonight’s event once again reminds me of our political struggles over the years and the support I enjoyed from many support structures such as The Buhari Organisation (TBO) and Buhari Support Organisation (BSO). I am happy that today we are not only celebrating our election victory, but our numerous landmark achievements. “I have listened and I acknowledge with delight the story of Buhari Support Organisation (BSO) past, present and future from previous speakers. In particular, I commend the plan to reorganise and reposition the organisation towards the forth coming election and beyond. This has once again given me further encouragement, hope and optimism in our political journey.” The President added: “At this point, I would like to acknowledge the overwhelming support I enjoyed from individuals and organisations across the country over the years. I say thank you to all those who contributed to our successes in one way or the other. Those, who attended the ceremony, included the President’s wife, Dr. Aisha Buhari, the Vice President’s wife, Dolapo Osinbajo. Also at the occasion were the Nasarawa State Governor Tanko Almakura and the Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun. Former Secretary to the Government of the Federation Babachir David Lawal was also among dignitaries that attended the occasion.
