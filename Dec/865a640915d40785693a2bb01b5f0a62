The Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Opeyemi Oke, yesterday inaugurated 47 newly-recruited sheriffs to quicken trials and justice delivery. She urged them to shun corruption and be above board in the discharge of their duties. Justice Oke at the induction held at the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja noted that the sheriffs were critical to the smooth running and efficiency of the justice system. She said the court could not assume jurisdiction without the proper service of the originating processes. The chief judge said the recruitment and training of the sheriffs were targeted at overhauling the old order characterised by “complaints of delays in service, failure to serve, falsification of affidavits of service, delays in reporting service, laziness, ineptitude, corruption, among others.” She said the recruitment was part of her administration’s “wide range of far-reaching innovations” to address some of the lapses in the justice system. “You are a new breed. You represent a new dispensation in the Sheriff Corps, and by the grace of the Almighty God, you have come in at this time to breathe new life and, by God’s grace, to change the old order. “You cannot afford to blend with the system. You are expected to stand out, you are expected to stand for what is right at all times. “Shun all forms of corruption and take your jobs seriously,” the CJ told the new recruits. She said a number of the old sheriffs had been dismissed for unethical conducts. At the ceremony, the sheriffs were presented with certificates, marking their completion of a three-week induction course at the Lagos State Judiciary Training School.
