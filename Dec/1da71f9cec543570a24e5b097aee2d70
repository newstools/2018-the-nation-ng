Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) has commenced an indefinite industrial in protest against what it described as consistent failure on the part of the government to implement agreements it willingly signed with the union since 2010 and constant efforts to derail the Polytechnic sector. Addressing a news conference in Abuja on Wednesday, National President of the Usman Dutse said since 2010 when the agreement was signed between the union and government, they have been in consistent engagement with the government leading to the signing of several memorandum which the government has constantly failed to implement. Dutse said the issues in contention include Conditions of members of the union; review of obsolete legal regimes and other policy documents which serve as governing instruments in the sector; non-existence/deplorable state of the existing facilities including classrooms, libraries, students’ hostels, laboratories, workshops, studios and office accommodation etc; discriminatory policies against the Sector and its products, victimization of union leaders and non payment of members’ salaries in several states. According to him, “For each of these outlined above, the government has always agreed to implement agreements aimed at the requisite interventions and a turn around of the sector. Regrettably, its been a consistent story of woes and disappointments. “The issues in contention are well rehearsed, taking roots in the provisions of the originating document (2010 ASUP/FGN Agreement). To make matters worse, government has been making fresh inroads in its penchant for undermining the sector by pursuing the implementation of policies with the ultimate aim of treating symptoms of an ailment and at the same time allowing same ailment to devour the diseased sector.” He said further that other grievances of the union include the non implementation of the NEEDS assessment report, non payment of salaries of state owned Polytechnics, non-payment of allowances and shortfall in personnel releases to Polytechnics, the non release of the reviewed scheme of service and condition of service as well as the delay in assenting to the reviewed Polytechnics Act among others. He said that the union has been left with no other option than the painful path of embarking on an indefinite strike in its bid to save the sector from collapse and asked Nigerians to address the issues, asking members to remain steadfast.
