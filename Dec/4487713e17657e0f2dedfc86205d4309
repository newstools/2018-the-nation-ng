Brighton’s Nigerian defender Leon Balogun becomes the first African player in the English Premier League to join the Common Goal campaign. The campaign now has 68 male and female players involved from six continents who have generated more than $1 million for high impact community organisations. “I feel we could be doing more to help those who are less fortunate. As football players, we enjoy a high place in society and so we have a very important role to play,” Balogun said. Manchester United’s Juan Mata was the first player to join the campaign while Balogun’s compatriot William Troost-Ekong, Ghana’s David Accam and Lesotho’s Bokang Mothoana have also joined. Uganda international Jean Sseninde was the first African and sole female player from the continent to join the Common Goal initiative. “Joining Common Goal gives me the opportunity to actively help and support people in their communities and open up doors to a better life. This gives me so much joy because as footballers we can do a lot to make a social impact around the world,” he added. The defender, 30, joined Brighton in May and scored his first goal for the club in a thrilling 3-1 win over rivals Crystal Palace early this month. Born in Germany, Balogun, who has previously played for Hannover, Werder Bremen, Fortuna Düsseldorf and Mainz, has made 25 appearances for Nigeria. He played all three matches at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
