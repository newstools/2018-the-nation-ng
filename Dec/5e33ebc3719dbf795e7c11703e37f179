Three teenagers were yesterday remanded in Kirikiri Prison by an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court following their arraignment for allegedly gang-raping a teenage girl. Chief Magistrate Olufunke Sule-Amzat rejected their bail application and ordered that they be kept in custody. They are Wasiu Lawal, 18, Tosin Taoreed, 18, and Peter Joseph, 19, who reside in Ikate, Ajah, Lagos. Prosecutor Benson Emuerhi said the offence was committed on November 18 at 11pm, at Eyiwuawi Street, Ikate, Lagos. He alleged that the 18-year-old girl, who was sent on an errand by her uncle, was returning home when she was ambushed by the trio. “When the girl was going home after delivering the message, she met the accused, who forcefully dragged her inside a workshop. “The accused covered her mouth so that her cries would not be heard and gang-raped her,” Emuerhi alleged. He said after the assault, the girl went home crying and told her uncle what happened. “The case was reported at the police station and the accused were arrested,” the prosecutor added. Sule-Amzat adjourned till January 21.
