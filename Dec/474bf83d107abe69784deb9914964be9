An indigenous minerals company, Kian Smith Trade & Company Limited, has commenced the construction of Nigeria’s first gold refinery in Ogun State. The ground breaking of the refinery was done by the Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Abubakar Bawa Bwari. It is scheduled to start production in 2019, sourcing most of its ore from miners in the country. Bwari at the ceremony said, “The present administration is determined to develop the mining sector to act as a catalyst for sustainable economic growth of the country. “Part of our marching orders in the Mines and Steel Development ministry is that we are expected to develop the sector to increase its contribution to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), improve its capacity to create jobs and engender sustainable mining.” Governor of Ogun State  Ibikunle Amosun, who was represented by the Commissioner for Agriculture Adepeju Adebajo expressed enthusiasm about the project, saying it was in line with the state government’s industrialization plan. The Vice Chairman of the company, Nere Teriba, said the refinery will start with a production capacity of three tonnes per month of 99.99 per cent gold and one ton per month production of 99.99 per cent silver. The refinery when completed will provide more than 500,000 jobs in two years.
