â€¢Millions of dollars stolen Suspected robbers operating on a motorcycle have reportedly attacked a yet-to-be identified female Bureau De Change operator in Aba, Abia State. The gunmen reportedly made away with millions of dollars. The Nation learnt that the woman later died in hospital, but Police Commissioner Chris Ezike she was still alive. The incident, it was gathered, occurred at the popular Market Road section, where Bureau De Change operators stayed. The woman was said to have arrived Aba with huge sums of dollars and other foreign currencies, which she had sourced from a bank. They are expected to be in high demand during the Christmas season. A source said the hoodlums, who apparently had knowledge of her return and the purpose for which she traveled outside the state, trailed the woman to the area. Bureau De Change operators refused to comment on the incident. The Nation learnt that the operators are now doing business in fear.
