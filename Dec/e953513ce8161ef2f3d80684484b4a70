The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has uncovered 10, 210 bags of Cannabis Sativa, popularly called Indian hemp,  concealed in a makeshift warehouse in Ondo State. Head of Public Affairs Mr. Jonah Achema, in a statement to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Abuja, said the Indian hemp, weighing 132.730 tons, were concealed at the warehouse located in Uteh, a remote community in the state. He said the warehouse, which belonged to a man simply referred to as Peter, was located in a very thick forest where all cannabis harvests within the forest were stored for distribution to the illicit drug markets. “Peter, who is at large, is said to be the Chairman of Cannabis Cultivators Association in Uteh, Ondo State. “The storage facility where the consignments belonging to over 30 farmers were stored was guarded by armed men, who took to their heels upon sighting the NDLEA officers and men. “The operation code named “Operation Thunder Strike II”, was jointly carried out by the agency’s Special Enforcement Team along with the agency’s Tactical teams from Ondo and Edo commands,” Acheme said. He said the agency had stormed the forests in October 2018 where it destroyed several hectares of cannabis plantations and storage facilities.
