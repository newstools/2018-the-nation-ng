For allegedly diverting clothes worth about N5.2m and selling them N100,000, a transporter Gabriel Onyeka has been arrested by operatives of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) Lagos. Onyeka was apprehended after the buyer he took the bags of clothes to at Ebute-Ero market alerted the police. It was gathered that the unnamed buyer had suspected the seller after he offered 12 bags filled with clothesÂ  for sale at N500,000. According to the police, the said buyer offered to pay N100,000 and Onyeka agreed, fuelling suspicion in the mind of the buyer who notified security operatives. It was gathered that in the course of investigation, detectives found out that the clothes belonged to one Alhaji Dabuzu in Kano State who handed them to Onyeka for delivery to a customer in Aba, Abia State. Investigations showed that the real owner had gone to New Park in Kano State to waybill the goods but instead of taking them to the intended buyer, the suspect diverted them to Lagos with intent to sell them and keep the money. According to the police, Onyeka admitted to have stolen the goods, adding that he was desperate to raise money to travel to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The FSARS operatives also arrested a suspected gang of armed robbers alleged to have terrorised lodgers, residents around Igando and Ikotun. The gang allegedly led by one Emmanuel Olasunkanmi alias Federal was arrested in a hotel last month by a team led by Festus Olaniyi, a Superintendent of Police (SP). According to the Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) incharge of FSARS Lagos Ibrahim Kaoje, others arrested alongside Olasunkanmi were Ahmed Agunbiade alias Omo Jo Ibo, Dotun Ogunsanya, Nurudeen Agbeyewo, Segun Okinade and Usman Akinde. Kaoje said 15 stolen motorcycles, household items and three cut-to-size pistols were recovered from the gang. The suspects were said to have told the police they bought the guns at N30,000 each.
