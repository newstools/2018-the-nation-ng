Governor Muhammadu Bindow of Adamawa has warned youths in the country to shun the use of abusive words on elders and leaders in the society. Bindow gave the warning at the 20th year anniversary of Islamic Development Center (IDC) on Saturday in Yola. He also advised them to desist from making unpleasant comments on their leaders especially on the social media platforms. “We should be very careful and cautious about  the way and manner our youths are abusing leaders on social media platforms. “The social media platforms should be regarded as means of enlightenment, development, education and peaceful coexistence in the society. “But it is unfortunate that today in Nigeria almost 90 per cent of those on social media platforms are using it negatively either to blackmail or cause unrest,’’ Bindow said. He also advised the Federal Government to sanitize the system and called on those involved in negative acts to desist from such. In his address, Umar Muhammad, the Ameer of the Center, said the center was established 20 years ago. Muhammad said that the center had within the last years fostered peace, progress and unity among Muslims and their neighbours. “The center has since its establishment in 1998 served as the channel of communication and understanding between Muslims and non –Muslims,’’ he said.
