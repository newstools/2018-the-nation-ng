MILLIONS of people from around the world will from tomorrow pour into the Redemption Camp of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) for 2018 Congress with the theme “Glory ahead.” The six-day inter-church event ends on Saturday. The church has strong presence in 197 countries around the world, from where members are expected to attend the Congress. This year’s Congress is the 21st in the series, having started in 1998 in Lekki with a massive attendance that nearly brought Lagos to a standstill. General Overseer RCCG Worldwide Pastor Enoch Adeboye said: “I assure you in the name of the one who is called the King of Glory and the source of all that is truly glorious that your life will never be the same after this Congress. “When God showed a little of His Glory to Moses, his face shown so brightly that people could not get close to him. He had to wear a veil to cover his face. Moses’ life was never the same again. “When also the cloud descended, the Glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle; and when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys.” Adeboye will be leading dozens of other ministers of God from all over the world. To handle the huge congregation without any incident, the organizers have made efforts to ensure the safety and comfort of all worshippers. Power and water supplies have witnessed significant improvements over the years. The Congress has always also been characterised by miracles, signs and wonders; and the anointing of mantles like handkerchiefs, which believers have used for healing miracles and even raising the dead.
