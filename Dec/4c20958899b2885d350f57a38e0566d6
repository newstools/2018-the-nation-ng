Chocolate City signee, Ckay, has disclosed why he featured South African songbird, Moonchild, and Nigerian indigenous rapper Zlatan Ibile in the remix of his hit song ‘Container.’ “I wanted to bring cultures together with the remix,” he said. “I didn’t want it to be 100% what was expected’ said Ckay who is currently working on his EP. “People probably expected a ‘shaku shaku’ artiste on the remix but I decided to do just the opposite. I brought in a huge South African Gqom artist, Moonchild, who speaks Zulu and a yoruba rapper whom I really like, Zlatan. They both nailed it and everyone LOVES the combo.” According to the afrobeats artiste, ‘Container’ which he co-produced with Tempoe is a feel good music. “If you look closely, there is a message. The song basically inspires you to go out there and get that paper. Go and make your money. I am a very versatile afrobeats artist. ‘Container’ falls quite well in the afrobeats genre.” Ckay further disclosed that his Extented Play is (EP) which he is currently working on is titled ‘CKay The First.’ “I have a lot of amazing sounds there. I’ve also got vocals from peruzzi, terri, boj and other great artists on it. It shows different sides of my artistry and paints a great picture of who CKAY is. Not the next this or that but the first CKay. I’m not like anyone. No one like me. No one will ever be like me”. On his relationship with Chocolate City, he said, “I don’t live at chocolate city. I have a working relationship/contract with them and we are working hard to achieve a common goal.”
