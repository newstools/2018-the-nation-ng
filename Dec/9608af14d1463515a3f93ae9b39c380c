It’s a big pleasure to be here among all these players. “I am still trying to realise that I have become part of a group of exceptional players to win the Ballon d’Or throughout history,” Modric said after winning the award. World Cup winners Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappe were among the closest challengers to Modric for the most coveted player award in the sport. The ceremony was hosted by former Tottenham and Newcastle star David Ginola. Missing out on first prize this year was Juventus striker Ronaldo, who has won the Ballon d’Or five times since 2008.

She scored an incredible 42 goals in 25 games for her club last term. “I want to ask every young woman to believe in themselves,” she says upon receiving the award. Kylian Mbappe won the inaugural Kopa Trophy. The French youngster has been named as the best Under-21 player in the world. Chapeau, Kylian. The PSG forward said: “This is award just makes me hungrier to go on & achieve more… my next aim is to lift absolutely every trophy.” Factoid for you, from my colleague Jake Polden, the Kopa Trophy is named after the third ever winner of the Ballon d’Or, Raymond Kopa, who won the award in 1958.
