Super Eagles’ forward, Alex Iwobi is Nigeria’s only hope of winning the 2018 African Footballer of the Year Award as he made it to the final 10 nominees for the award after the duo of Odion Ighalo and Ahmed Musa were dropped from the initial 34 earlier released by CAF. Iwobi will have to contend with reigning champion Mohammed Salah, Gunners teammate Aubemeyang and of course, Senegal’s Saido Mane who are all favourites for the award. In the young player category, Super Eagles’ and Leicester City midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi remains on course to claim his first CAF award after the Nigerian made the final three nominations alongside Morocco’s Achraf Hakimi and Franck Kessie of Ivory Coast. It was, however, all good for Nigeria in the women’s category with three-time African Footballer of the Year, Asisiat Oshoala making the cut with Francisca Ordega and defender Onome Ebi. Desire Oparanozie was dropped from the initial list. 2018 AWCON MVP and highest goal score Christina Thembi Kgatlana will definitely be the favourite to dislodge Oshoala after the South African forward impressed at the recently concluded championship in Ghana. Similarly, Nigeria female national team, the Super Falcons have also been shortlisted for the team of the year, while head coach Thomas Dennerby also makes the cut for the coach of the year award. The shortlisted nominees were decided by votes from the members of the CAF Technical & Development Committee. The final phase will involve votes from CAF media experts, legends, coaches of the quarter-finalists of the CAF Champions League and CAF Confederation Cup, and coaches and captains of the 54 member associations. The Awards Gala will be held on January 8, 2019 in Dakar, Senegal.
