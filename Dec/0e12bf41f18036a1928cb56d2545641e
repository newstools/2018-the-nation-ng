We thank God for his life and for piloting the affairs of the state with focus on the wellbeing of the people,” he said. President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Rev. Felix Omobude, urged Christians in the state to be patient as the best of Obaseki’s leadership style was on the way.
