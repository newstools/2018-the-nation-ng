Head Coach of the U-17 National Boys Team, Golden Eaglets, Manu Garba has assured that his five –time world champions would be ready for business when the 2019 Africa U-17 Cup of Nations opens in Tanzania on  April 14, 2019. Speaking to thenff.com, Garba said his wards already have the mentality of champions, but would not approach the finals in East Africa with an attitude of over-confidence. The man who led Nigeria to triumph at the 2013 FIFA U-17 World Cup tournament in the United Arab Emirates was reacting to Thursday’s Draw which put Nigeria in Group A alongside hosts Tanzania, Angola and Uganda. “We are champions of West Africa, which gives us a good feeling going to Tanzania. However, it is a tournament of champions as the other teams also won their regional tournaments. “We will prepare very well to conquer, in order to qualify for the FIFA U-17 World Cup finals coming up in Peru.” Group B has Guinea, Cameroon, Morocco and Senegal, with all four semi finalists guaranteed places at the FIFA World Cup finals. The 2019 Africa U-17 Cup of Nations will hold from April 14th to 28th, 2019. Nigeria won the world title in 1985, 1993, 2007, 2013 and 2015.
