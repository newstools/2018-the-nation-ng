THE Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) yesterday warned the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security agents against helping the All Progressives Congress (APC) to rig to avoid the wrath of Nigerians. Its National Chairman Prince Uche Secondus spoke in Ilorin  during the Northcentral presidential rally of the PDP candidate Atiku Abubakar. Secondus accused INEC of rigging the governorship election in Osun State in favour of the APC. He said: “Don’t bother about the INEC, they can no longer rig. I want to warn INEC that it rigged and escaped all the previous elections. The 2019 elections, you cannot escape if you rig unless you want to cause crisis in Nigeria. “Let us warn the INEC chair that he should not cause crisis in Nigeria by rigging 2019 elections. If INEC wants peace in Nigeria, elections must be free and fair. If INEC likes, it should ignore the card reader, manipulate the machines to do whatsoever INEC wants it to do but Nigerians will not accept rigged elections. So, you better be warned. “And we salute the courage of the patriotic security agencies. Our Army is the best in Africa. Our police, some of them are very good, but this time around in 2019, the police and the Army cannot be used. As all voters are Army and Police. So, you must police your votes and be by the side to make sure that your materials are not carried away. “There will be no postponement of elections because part of strategy of APC is to cause crises in some states, postpone the elections and come with Army and Police to prevent some people from voting just as they did in Osun State. It cannot work.” Senate President Bukola Saraki lamented that the insecurity situation in the country had degenerated, especially in the Northcentral and Northwest states. He added that Nigeria’s corruption ratings by international organisations had plummeted. Kwara State Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed told the gathering that the state is wholly PDP’s.
