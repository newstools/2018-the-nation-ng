•Party: no cause for alarm The Anambra State Executive Committee (SEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC), led by Emeka Ibe, has been sacked by a Federal High Court. But in a statement yesterday in Awka, the state capital, by the State Publicity Secretary, Okelo Madukaife, the party said there was no cause for alarm. The sack followed a suit filed by one of the state chairmanship contestants in the party’s congress in May, Mr Onyi Uzochukwu. The plaintiff said Ibe was not properly nominated during the congress. He prayed the court to nullify the congress and call for a fresh one. Delivering judgment yesterday, Justice I. B. Gafai nullified the congress and ordered for a fresh one. But the party said the court judgment had not been served on any of the sacked persons. The statement said: “Our attention has been drawn to reports in some sections of the media to the effect that the Anambra State Executive of APC has been dissolved by a Federal High Court sitting in Awka. “Our State Executive has not been served with any court process in any High Court matter relating to any subject around our mandate duly conferred on May 19… “However, given our status as a party of the rule of law and due process, we shall, if and when we are served with such a process and judgment, study it properly with a view to doing the needful on it, within the hierarchy of laws and courts in Nigeria. “For now, there is no shaking, as we remain in our duty post with three years and a half to complete our tenure. “In the interim, our Executive remain intact, properly constituted and within the due discharge of its duties in our great party.”
