Since 1992, following the United Nations’ declaration of the International Day for people living with disabilities, every December 3 is a day for people with disabilities. Its the aim is to increase global awareness of their situation in all spheres of society. The day affords us an opportunity to drive conversations targeted at improving their rights and wellbeing. In Nigeria, individuals, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) have continued to remind President Muhammadu Buhari of his promise and urged him to sign the Nigerian Disability Bill into law. This month makes it the 45th month since Buhari made a pledge during a town hall meeting in Lafia, Nasarawa State, to end discrimination and stigmatisation against persons with disabilities in Nigeria. While the National Assembly (NASS) has completed the legislative actions on the bill to end discrimination against persons with disabilities, the president is yet to sign the bill into law. Global statistics projects that approximately 80 per cent of people with disabilities live in developing countries, with one-in-five of the world’s poorest having at least, one disability. It is believed that when the bill is signed into law, it would maximally boost human capital development and encourage indigenous and foreign participation of persons with disabilities in the economic, social and political development of the country. This year’s International Day of People with Disabilities with the theme: Empowering persons with disabilities for inclusive, equitable and sustainable development, brings this subject to the table of state actors again, particularly when considered that their rights and wellbeing are also integrated part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and other international development frameworks which Nigeria is signatory to.
