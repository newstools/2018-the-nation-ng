A 44-year-old driver, Mr. Wale Ogungbesan, is seeking help  to raise N10 million for kidney transplant. He said he spent N71,000 twice weekly on pints of blood and dialysis when he has the money. This, he said, included N36,000 for two pints of blood and N35,000 for dialysis. Ogungbesan said he was now receiving blood and dialysis once in a week because of lack of funds. He said whenever he missed the dialysis because of money, his leg becomes swollen. Ogungbesan said he would start vomiting blood and his breathing would be fast and at that point, his family would rush him to Lagos from Ogun State for dialysis. He said: “I used to work in an insurance company in Lagos as a contract staff. But for the past four months, I have not been to the office because of my illness. It started on June 9. I travelled to Abeokuta on official assignment. When I returned, I had a terrible stomach upset. I could not sleep, stand or even do anything. “When I got home the second day, the pain was so severe that I visited a private hospital near my house at Sango in Ogun State. I was given drugs to ease the pain, but the pain did not stop. The next day, I was asked to run some tests, and I did. I was sweating profusely and breathing very fast. After the test, they said the problem might be with my appendix and they started treating appendicitis. But the pain continued. I later went to a hospital behind Sango garage, Abeokuta where they detected that my two kidneys were not working well. I was told I needed dialysis. I was coughing and vomiting blood. My friends, children and wife rushed me to a specialist medical centre. I did the tests again and the hospital confirmed that I had problem with my kidneys.”
