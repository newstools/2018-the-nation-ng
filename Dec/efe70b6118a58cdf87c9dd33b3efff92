He called for synergy among the various organs of the party for better performance at the general elections. He assured the APC senatorial candidate of his unwavering support during and after the elections. Basiru paid glowing tributes to the former governor for the fatherly roles he has been playing in the affairs of the party since its formation in 2014. He noted that Akande as the pioneer national chairman laid a solid foundation for the party. The campaign team visited some communities, including Alagbede, Ayegun, Oyeadunni, Oyi-Aratumi , Elemo-Ogun, Olotu, Isinmi –Enle and Ajebandele  all in Ifedayo Local Government. He promised to bring federal presence to the area to boost socio-economic activities in the area.. Basiru expressed gratitude for the massive support given to the APC  by the people of Ifedayo Local Government during the last governorship election. Responding on behalf of other community leaders, Alhaji  Jimoh Adebisi Pidan discosed that  the people  of the area had resolved to vote for Basiru and other APC candidates during the general elections. He said their decision was influenced by the developmental projects that APC had executed in the area, particularly access roads that enable farmers to transport their produce to market. The high point of the visit was the distribution of exercise books and other writing materials by Ajibola Basiru Campaign Organisation to the students of Oke-Ila Government High School.
