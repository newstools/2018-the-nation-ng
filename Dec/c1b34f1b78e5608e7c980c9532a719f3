The traditional head of Oke-Ogbere community in Oshodi-Isolo Local Government Area of Lagos State, Chief Tajudeen Ganiyu, has appealed to the government to complete the Ago drainage system. He told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that doing so during the dry season would make life comfortable for the residents. Ganiyu said people were always scared of moving around the drainage system during the rainy season. The traditional ruler said: “The construction of the bridge that leads from the community to Isheri as well as the drainage at Ago have helped to improve business and attract more people to the area.”
