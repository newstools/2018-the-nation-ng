APC Sowande polled 1,442 votes to defeat his Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) opponent Azeez Sunkanmi Taiwo, who got 286 votes. While monitoring the election in some polling units, LASIEC Commissioner in charge of the area, Olusegun Ayedun, expressed dissatisfaction at the low voter turnout for the election. Ayedun said the votersâ€™ apathy was disappointing despite the fact that the commission sensitised stakeholders for the election. He pointed out that the voter apathy experienced during the bye-election was a reflection of what is obtainable across the country. He, therefore, enjoined the various registered political parties and other stakeholders to complement the efforts of electoral commissions in the country in sensitizing voters to show more interest in the electoral process. The bye-election was peaceful as security personnel were deployed to all polling units and the collation centre for the election. It would be recalled that the Councillorship seat in the affected Ward became vacant following the death of the former Councillor representing the ward, Solomon Awokoya, who died a few months ago.
