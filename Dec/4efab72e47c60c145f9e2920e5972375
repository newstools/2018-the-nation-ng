Nigerian-Canadian artiste, Kelly Anthony is out with a suggestive song, ‘Elevate’, which he says was inspired by his career growth. “In this life, it’s like people don’t like to see others succeed and grow in life,” says the crooner of ‘Unstoppable’ (May 2018), and ‘Maye’ (September 2018). The singer who says he speaks for himself and his surroundings, disclosed: “I lost a lot of friends in my life as God blessed me,” adding that, “People became extremely envious of me as things started to change in my life for GOOD.”
“But i couldn’t understand why anybody would be upset when their friend is doing good in life.
“It’s quite sad actually because I’ve never felt that way about anybody.
I’ve never felt anger and animosity towards anybody that was succeeding in life,” he lamented.
“So i went to the studio one day and i was searching for inspiration for a new song. I wanted to create something people can highly relate to…. “They try to hate cuz the man dem just dey elevate, i elevate, we elevate… These were the first words that landed in my brain.” ‘Elevate’, according to him, was shot in Toronto by Seeds Visuals, a very talented Nigerian Canadian director. On why he didnt use scantily dressed vixens in his music video like most artistes, he says, “To be honest I’ve never been a fan of flaunting scantily dressed vixens in my music videos because my music is my art and my videos have to be able to explain my thoughts,” adding that, “In this video for ELEVATE, I wanted to show life as a successful musician from all my hard work.
My goal was to motivate others with the song and video for them to focus on their art, goals and keep pursuing their dreams. For a man to become a successful man he must restrain from women, focus on one woman that supports his dreams and all will unfolded.”
