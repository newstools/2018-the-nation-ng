RECTORS of Federal Polytechnic Offa Dr. Lateef Olatunji and Kwara State Polytechnic, Ilorin, Kwara State Mas’ud Elelu have urged members of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP) and polytechnics owner governments to embrace dialogue. Specifically, Elelu urged ASUP to desist from taking an extremist position on bone of contentions between them and owner governments. He said strike action is not the only solution to challenges confronting education. Elelu told reporters in Ilorin, the state capital, ahead of today’s 25th convocation ceremonies of the institution. He said the institution, in its usual characteristic, did not join the Academic Staff Union of Polytechnic (ASUP) strike. Elelu, who said academic staff of the institution would be involved in the convocation ceremony, expressed displeasure that ASUP decided to embark on the nationwide strike. He said though the polytechnic education is confronted with many challenges, an industrial action is not the only way to find solutions to the challenges. To Olatunji, academic unions must change their orientation, saying that governments and unions should always embrace dialogue. The rector said academic teachers in developed world do have issues with government, adding that their orientation of dialogue, rather than strike actions had helped smoothen and stabilise academic calendar. He spoke in Offa, Offa Local Government Area at the institution’s 25th matriculation ceremony.
