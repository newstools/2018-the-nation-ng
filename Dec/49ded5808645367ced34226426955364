THE National President of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Youth Vanguard, Comrade Kabir Haruna Alfa, has said the organisation will ensure that President Muhammadu Buhari is re-elected in 2019. In statement by the group’s National Secretary, Chinedu Mbakwe Obi, Alfa explained that President Buhari deserved another four years to consolidate and finish the work he had started. He appealed to Nigerians, particularly the youths, to vote en masse for the president. Alfa said the development by Buhari so far was good enough to get him another term. He said in area of security, a priority in Buhari’s campaign in 2015, the APC government has recorded giant strides. He explained that the parts of Nigeria that were taken over by Boko Haram were retrieved by the government. The National president explained that when APC came in to power, electricity was pegged at 4000mgwts in 16 years of its rule. But in a little more than three years, the APC government had generated up to 8000mgwts and distribution had improved. He said the introduction of TSA by the government had helped to stop corruption and saved cash that was shared by political elites. Alfa said under the Buhari administration the Economic Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has worked hard to mop most of the looted funds, adding that the economy has to, a large extent, stabilised. He explained that the country’s foreign reserve was $25billion when the government took over, but now it has risen to $48billion, a good sign of economic stability. According to him, food import has reduced and farmers get a good market for their produce.
