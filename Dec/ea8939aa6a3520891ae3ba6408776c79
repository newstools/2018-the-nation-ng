Some of the players who have represented Nigeria at international tournaments will bring their experience to bear in the championship. According to the BFN, the tournament will also be used as a test run for the All African Badminton Championship, holding in April 2019 also in Rivers State. “With Rivers State winning the bid to host Africa’s most prestigious Badminton Championship, the BFN and the Rivers state government thought it wise to establish a National Badminton Championship, to test run the facilities in the state and in the process, institute a National Badminton Championship in the state for the first time ever,” the organisers added. According to BFN, The points garnered by players in this championship is for national ranking, while the African Championship is a qualifying event for the Tokyo Olympic Games. The Badminton Federation noted that all the participants were ready to play their part in an exciting tournament with the National Sports Festival, which ended in Abuja last week, serving as preparation for the Rivers Governor’s championship. “The National Sports Festival gave the players the opportunity to get in shape for the National Championship. Once the Sports Festival ended, arrangements were made to transport the players from Abuja to participate at the National Championships. The BFN also assured that the Local Organising Committee (LOC) is currently working round the clock to explore opportunities for partnerships to make the event a truly remarkable one.
