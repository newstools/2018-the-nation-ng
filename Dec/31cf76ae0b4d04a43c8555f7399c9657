Sokoto State Government has warned that it will not tolerate any form of harassment and intimidation by any political party in the state. Speaking at the inauguration of state’s Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Contact and Mobilisation Committee, the Deputy Governor, Maniru Muhammad Dan’iya stressed that it was the sole responsibility of the state government to protect lives and property of the people. According to him, the people of Sokoto were known to be peaceful and law-abiding and would remain so before, during and after the 2019 general elections. He said: “PDP in Sokoto would not fold its arms and allow some people claiming Federal Government backing to continue to harass and intimidate its supporters just to create fear in them for political advantage. “As we remain law abiding citizens, any form of Intimidation and harassment in the name of politics using elements in Federal Government agencies will be resisted.” He urged the people to rally round the State Government in its efforts to maintain peace and safeguard their children from politicians who are hell bent on using them as political thugs. Dan’iya inaugurated a three-man sub-Contact and Mobilisation  Committee for each of the three senatorial zones.
