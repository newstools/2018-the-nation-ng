Former Chairman of Bursari Local Government Area of Yobe State Alhaji Abba  Ganatata has vowed to send Governor Ibrahim Gaidam  to political retirement by defeating him  in next year’s senatorial election. Both candidates are contesting for the Zone A senatorial seat. Gaidam is running on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC). He got the ticket unopposed after former Governor Bukar Abba Ibrahim stepped down for him, following series of peace meetings and horse-trading, Ganatata got the PDP ticket without any friction within the party hierarchy. Ganagtata, whose posters have flooded the streets of Damaturu,  the capital, said he will be a beeter senator than Gaidam. He said: “I know I can represent my people at the senate better than Governor Ibrahim Gaidam. My people also know that and they are going to make a good choice of me rather than voting Governor Ibrahim Gaidam for the Senate. I know he has served as a governor for about ten years now but I am not afraid of him. I am ready for him,” Tata boasted. Ganatata added: “What I did while as chairman of Bursari local Government has never been outmatched by any chairman in the history of Yobe State  after so many years of my exit. As a member of the board of TETfund, I have brought development to all tertiary institutions across Yobe, not just my zone. You can go and verify that. “I am a grassroot politician who is connected to the people and at the same time very accessible to the common people taking care of their needs. I will not be a lawmaker that builds a wall around me to fend off my constituents but rather my people will constitute the wall around to form a formidable force that will affect their needs through impactful legislations,” Tata explained. “My track records have shown that I use to give my people every sense of belonging and bring to them what belongs to them in everything that I do. If elected as senator, I will defend them, stand for them and also serve them well.”
