Nigeria’s head of delegation to the African Women Cup of Nations, Aisha Falode has commended the Super Falcons for reaching the final, which she says is their own part of a bargain agreed with the officials before the competition began, footballlive.ng reports. Falode, who is an executive committee member of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and chairperson of the Women League (NWFL), said the players responded well to her charge that they should just concentrate on playing their game, while the officials take care of all welfare issues, bonuses and other emoluments. Falode also thanked the NFF leadership for giving adequate attention to the Falcons, as she stressed that it is not only the male team, Super Eagles that deserve support and fat welfare packages. The ace sports broadcaster-turned-administrator reckoned that the Eagles cannot survive without the Falcons, but admitted that the ladies will now have to confirm that once again by winning their ninth continental title today. Falode said: “We always believe in the Super Falcons to get us result. We always believe that they are not only strong mentally but physically. “We are now on the right track. The girls are motivated, they are concentrating, they are strong as individuals and as a unit. “They have been given everything they need to perform and excel. They have been paid their bonuses and allowances. “They’ve kept their part of the agreement, so we just have to do our own part as well, which we have done, but we will still do more.”
