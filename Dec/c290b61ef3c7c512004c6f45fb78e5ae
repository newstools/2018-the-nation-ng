After an action packed four days of top class squash excitement, the first ever PSA sanctioned senior squash tournament in Nigeria organised by the only squash club in Nigeria – the OTrafford Squash Club,  will end today at the 82nd Division of the Army Officers Mess in Marina, Lagos. Today’s grand finale will feature the women’s and men’s final with  winner’s prize money of $1000 and $500 respectively. The captain of O Trafford Squash Club,  Biyi Mabadeje expressed delight that the OTrafford PSA sanctioned tournament has recorded a significant milestone in the Nigerian squash calendar. “We are proud that this tournament has come to stay. We are very happy because this started a few months ago and we thought it will not be achievable but with the efforts of our Chairman,  Aderemi Adeseun and other club members,  we have been able to surmount our fears and put up this tournament,” he said. According to Mabadeje: “Two things made this tournament outstanding. Firstly,  its been sanctioned by the international squash body -PSA, which means players will gather points and secondly,  I think we deserve an accolade as this is the only tournament in Nigeria with the highest number of participants.” Seventy-five squash players were registered for the tournament, 48 men and 27 women including top ranked squash players in Nigeria.
