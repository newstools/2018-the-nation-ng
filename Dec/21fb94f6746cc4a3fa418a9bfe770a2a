As drivers prepare for the festive period and end of the year travel rush, Aid Lives Trust is collaborating with Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Lagos to organize a sensitization program. According to the Co-ordinator, Aids Lives Trust, Elizabeth Egiaye, the program which is tagged ‘Why Rush Campaign’ is aimed at cautioning drivers on the dangers of over speeding which leads to accident and permanent disabilities. The campaign, Egiaye pointed out is also targeted at ‘curbing the menace of accidents on our roads during the festive period and in extension save lives which is our ultimate goal’.
