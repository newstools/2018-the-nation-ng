An Upper Customary Court in Kaduna, on Tuesday, remanded a 35-year-old man, James Matthew in prison custody for alleged theft of a motorcycle. The judge, Ibrahim Emmanuel, directed that the defendant should be remanded for allegedly causing body injury with a machete to the complainant, Ezekiel Moses. He gave the order after the defendant pleaded not guilty to the offences. Emmanuel ordered that the defendant should be remanded in prison pending a formal application for his bail. The judge adjourned the case until Dec. 21 for hearing. The Police Prosecutor, Insp Chidi Leo, had earlier told the court that the defendant committed the offences on Nov. 14 in  Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State. Leo said that the matter was reported at Kachia Police Station by the complainant and it was later transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department. The prosecutor said that the defendant, who lives at Kachia, conspired with two others now at large to snatch the complainant’s motorcycle and cut his hand with a cutlass. Leo said the two unknown persons rode the motorcycle to an unknown destination and all efforts to recover it proved abortive. The offences, he said, contravened Sections 242 and 287 of the Kaduna State Penal Code, 2017. NAN
