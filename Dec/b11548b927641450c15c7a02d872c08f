An information technology expert and Alliance for Democracy (AD) governorship candidate in Ogun State, Seyi Olufade-Olowookere, has disclosed that scientific researches conducted on two different occasions in the state indicated a declining popularity for Governor Ibikunle Amosun. He claimed the surveys were carried out in May and July this year, adding that 76 percent of the respondents in the surveys were not only fed up with the governor and his administration, but also not favourably disposed to supporting whoever he presents as candidate for the March 2019 gubernatorial election. The 39-year-old politician who hailed from Iwoye in Ilaro, Yewa South Local Government Area of the state, made this known in a chat with the media in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, yesterday, disclosing that he was “technically a member of the All Progressives Congress (APC)” by reason of working for Governor Nasir El – Rufai’s administration in Kaduna State. Olufade-Olowookere said even though he fitted perfectly well into the governor’s description of a young IT guru and wizkid, he has elected to pursue his governorship dream independently and on the platform of AD, following the outcome of the said two surveys. He pledged to run a government where transparency, security, law and order, human capital development, infrastructure for economic prosperity, quality education and healthcare service would form the focal point of the administration if elected into office in 2019.
