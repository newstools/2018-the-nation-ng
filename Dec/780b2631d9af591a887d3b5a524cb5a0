The local chapter of Allied Peoples’ Movement (APM) in Ogun State has adopted President Muhammadu Buhari as its presidential candidate for the February 16, 2019 election. However, the party is fielding House of Representatives member Adekunle Akinlade as governorship candidate and Ms Adepeju Adebajo as deputy. Akinlade defected from the All Progressives Congress (APC) following the crisis that rocked the ruling party’s governorship primary.  Ogun State Governor Ibikunle Amosun claimed that the shadow election conducted by the Ogun APC  chapter was won by Akinlade. But the APC  National Working Committee ruled that the state executive of the party had no power to conduct governorship primary but the electoral panel set up by the NWC.
