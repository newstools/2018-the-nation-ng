The Chairman of Nigerian Indigenous Nationalities Alliance for Self-Determination Chief Fred Agbayegbe has said the restructuring of the country should be the priority of government and not the 2019 election.

The ethnic nationalities leader, who spoke in Lagos after their meeting, said it was a misplaced attention to proceed with the 2019 election without addressing issues antagonizing the unity of the country.

He added that the 1999 constitution had not met the expectations of Nigerians, noting that every effort to discuss the weakness of the constitution was never taken seriously.

He explained that the constitution was responsible for the uneven development in the country, stressing that its shortcoming made it possible for the pervasive corruption, poverty and hopelessness.

“It is also self evident that the many regional agitations in Nigeria, whether for resource control, exit from the failed Nigerian union or regional autonomy are basically responses to Nigeria’s distorted federalism.

“This raises sovereignty question that election cannot hold. The present imposed master/servant constitutional order which emanates from the series of decrees renders the 1999 unacceptable because it was not from the people.”

Agbayegbe said the most urgent challenge before the country is to reconstitutes itself back to being a federation as the only viable mechanism for addressing the self determination issues.

“At this point, we don’t need election that will exacerbate an already bad situation. The current dangerous crossfire fire between political gladiators and the trajectory of the political discourse in Nigeria is reminiscent the episodes which explode the collapse of the Nigerian union in 1966.

“We demand that in the place of general election in 2019, a transitional arrangement be immediately instituted to peacefully ease out the rejected unitary constitutional order.  While a body to midwife the emergence of successor constitutional arrangement,” he said.
