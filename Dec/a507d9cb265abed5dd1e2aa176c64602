BlackMusic Initiative, a movement which was started 15 years ago to create a cultural and social change in Africahas partnered the Esther Ajayi Foundation for this year’s edition of the Legend of Black Music Awards. Slated to take place December 21 at Golden Gate Restaurant, Ikoyi, Lagos, by 3pm, the event will reward key players and major achievers in the nigerian music space. The BMI Awards has three categories; the ‘Custodian of Culture’ Award, the ‘Humanitarian Award’ as well as the Music Legends Awards which will honour veterans in different genres with afrocentric elements. Expected to grace the occasion as the  Royal Fathers of the Day are the Ooni of Ife, HRM Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi and the Olu of Warri, Ogiamen Ikenwoli II. Other traditional rulers, who will all be conferred with the ‘Custodian of Culture’ Award are also expected to be present at the event. According to its convener, Ms Fehintoluwa Odejide, the BlackMusic Initiative (BMI) became necessary to meet the need of the foreign market, especially the Europe music market, which expects so much more than we are presently offering. Speaking on the initiative, Odejide, who has 27 years’ experience in the Nigerian music space, said that Nigerian youths, whose major escape is music don’t have enviable role models, and also do not have adequate knowledge of history and culture. On the decision of her foundation to partner and power the awards, Reverend Mother Esther Ajayi said that it was borne out of a need to honour those who have contributed their quota to developing Nigeria. “The Esther Ajayi Foundation is happy to throw its weight behind the BlackMusic Initiative Awards because we have come to realise that the principles they operate on are the same values we hold dear,” she said. “Part of our activities include supporting deserving causes. And we are proud to say that LBM Awards is worthy of such support.”
