A 46-year-old trader, Patrick Ene, who failed to pay a debt of N996,000 he owed after obtaining good from Heritage Hair Care and Cosmetics, was on Wednesday brought before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court. Ene, who lives at No.10, Olaniyi Yusuf St., Igando, is facing a two-count charge of theft and fraudulent conversion of money. He, however, denied the charges. The Prosecutor, ASP Fidelis Dike, told the court that the accused committed the offences on April 26, 2017 at 1.00p.m at Bankole Street, Lagos Island. Dike said that the accused obtained goods worth N996, 0000 from Heritage Hair Care and Cosmetics on credit since April 26, 2017 with an agreement to pay after sales of the goods. He said that Ene, who was granted credit because he was a regular customer at the cosmetics store, instead of paying his new debt, he converted the money to his personal use. “Mrs Chidi Emeronye, owner of the store, said that all efforts made to get her money back were abortive as the accused stopped picking her calls. “The accused was later traced and picked up by the police,” Dike said. He the offences contravened Sections 287 and 314 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. According to him, Section 287 stipulates three years imprisonment, while Section 314 stipulates 15 years imprisonment for any offender upon conviction. The Magistrate, Mr T. A. Anjorin-Ajose, admitted the accused to N50, 000 bail with one responsible surety in like sum. Anjorin-Ajose said that the surety must be a relative of the accused and must be gainfully employed. He adjourned the case until December 17 for mention. NAN
