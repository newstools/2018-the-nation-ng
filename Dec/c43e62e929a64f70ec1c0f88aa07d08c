Ondo State governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) has lamented the death of the founder, Oodua Peoples Congress, (OPC) Dr. Federick Fasehun who died on Saturday. Akeredolu described the late Fasehun as a disciplined citizen,  a Pan-Yoruba and nationalist to the core and intelligent medical practitioner who used his energy and other resources to fight for the interests of his people and the common man. He described as a shock to Ondo State and the entire country, adding that the deceased would be sorely missed by lovers of justice and peace. As a politician, Akeredolu in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary(CPS)Segun Ajiboye opined that the late Fasehun’s argument for egalitarian society where merit and equity are made parametric conditions for selecting leaders or people’s representatives would continue to dominate socio-political discourse. The governor said the  social scientists would also remember the deceased as a detribalised Nigeria per excellence whose place in the nation’s political history cannot be wished away, even in a hurry.
