There were indications yesterday that Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, could quit as the South-South campaign coordinator for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Sources close to the governor told The Nation yesterday that he was not happy because Atiku’s campaign committee was not carrying him along in its activities. The governor was said to have complained that some of the people appointed to work with him were appointed without his knowledge. An aide of the governor told our reporter yesterday that he was planning to communicate his decision to the presidential candidate. The National Chairman of PDP, Uche Secondus, had announced the appointment of Wike as the South-South coordinator of Atiku’s campaign a few days after the latter emerged the presidential candidate of the party at its national convention in Port Harcourt on October 6. His appointment was announced simultaneously as that of Senate President Bukola Saraki as the Director General of the Atiku Abubakar Campaign Organisation while Sokoto State governor, Aminu Tambuwal, was named as zonal coordinator for the Northwest. Others who were also named as zonal coordinators include Gombe State governor, Ibrahim Dankwambo (Northeast), Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom (Northcentral) and Ebonyi State governor, Dave Umahi (Southeast).
