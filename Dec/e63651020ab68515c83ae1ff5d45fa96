Abia State Police Commissioner Mr. Chris Ezike has said the command is still investigating the case of the drowned man at a swimming pool. He added that the friends of the deceased were taken back into custody to continue with investigation and rule out foul-play. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that a 20-year-old man drowned at the swimming pool of a hotel on Margret Avenue in GRA, Aba on November 29. The man was said to have gone to swim at the hotel’s pool during their colleague’s birthday party, but drowned. Sixteen other friends of the deceased at the party were arrested by the police for investigation and released on November 30. A police source told NAN that their release came after preliminary investigations involving CCTV footage preview at the Central Police Station, Aba failed to link them with their colleague’s death. However, NAN findings showed that State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday re-arrested and moved the boys to the police headquarters in Umuahia. Ezike said the police were not in for a witch-hunt, but wanted to rule out the possibility of foul play in the death of the young man. “You talked about CCTV footage. The footage did not show when the boy entered the pool. It only showed his body in the pool. “We are looking at negligent act; we are looking at wilful act. Wilful acts are different from negligent acts, but all or part can form the ingredients of a crime.”
