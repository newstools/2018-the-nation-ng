A former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Terngu Tsegba and  a former speaker of the  Assembly, Hon.Terseer Tsumba were left  injured after  three gunmen invaded  the  Makurdi International  Golf Course Thursday night. Both are prominent members of the golf club. An eye witness,Terfa Ape, told The Nation that moment after Tsegba and Tsumba retired to a section of the club house following a game of golf, the three gunmen came in, asking for Tsegba. An aide of the former Rep was said to have become suspicious of the men’s appearance and  asked them a few questions which they could not answer satisfactorily. The aide then grabbed one of the strangers only for another member of the gang to pull out a gun,and shot the aide. Fortunately for the  aide,he was hit only on the hand. The gunshots sparked a stampede in the area  with some of those present, including  Tsegba and Tsumba,to run for their lives. The two men fell down in the process and got injured. The gunmen themselves took to their heels, escaping into the surrounding bush. Tsegba and Tsumba were later taken to the hospital for treatment. Police spokesman DSP Moses Yamu said he was yet to be briefed on  the incident.
