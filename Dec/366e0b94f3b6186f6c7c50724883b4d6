The choice of former Governor Peter Obi as running mate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate Atiku Abubakar is one of the most profound and strategic political moves in the history of the nation, a former Minister of Health, Prof A.B.C Nwosu, has stated.   The elder statesman spoke  during the meeting of Igbo leaders at Nike Lake Hotel. Nwosu, who decried the scheming out of Igbos from strategic positions in Nigeria as if they do not have stakes in the country, said such tendencies were not good for the growth and development of the country. Nwosu, who said he was sure of Atiku/Obi victory in the forthcoming general elections, described Atiku’s choice of Obi as a round peg in a round hole. According to him: “Obi’s choice shows Atiku is coming to work. Obi is young,  knowledgeable,  competent and humble.” On specific attributes of Obi that made him choice acceptable,  Nwosu added: “Obi’s achievements as two-term governor of Anambra State speak volumes of his competence and point to him as a round peg in a round hole for a country that is seeking to come out of recession. “For a country that is seeking massive creation of jobs; for a government that badly needs prudence in government expenditure; for a government that wants to fight corruption effectively by plugging the expenditure leakages to have Obi is a step towards solving Nigeria’s myriad of problems.”
