The police have arrested a houseboy, Ben Peters, for allegedly breaking into his boss’ room to steal money and other valuables. The suspect was alleged to have burgled the room of 73-year-old retiree Alexander Okoye and wife Njideka, barely 11 days after he was employed. The police said Peters was employed on October 12 and on October 24, he robbed the couple of their $5,000, Toyota Camry saloon car, six packet shirts and a Motorola Android phone. Police spokesman Chike Oti, in a statement yesterday, said the couple petitioned Commissioner Imohimi Edgal, who directed the command’s Human Rights unit to investigate the matter. Oti said: “On December 18, barely two months after the incident, Peters was nabbed at a hideout in Agege, and some of the stolen items were recovered from him. “Investigation has shown that his real name is Usang Bassey Effiong and not Ben Peters, as he made his employer to believe. “The suspect has confessed to how he committed the crime. He said he noticed where Mr. Okoye usually hid his bedroom key. To gain access to the bedroom, he said he needed to duplicate the key; so he made a copy of the key. “It was on October 23 that he made up his mind to break into the couple’s bedroom. And to do so undetected, he disconnected the CCTV camera that would have recorded his activities, picked the bedroom key, broke into the couple’s room, stole their valuables and escaped with their car. “The suspect said robbing the couple was easy for him because the houseboy, they dismissed before employing him, Matthew Johnson Abam, was a member of his robbery syndicate who had furnished him with information about the couple before he was employed.”
