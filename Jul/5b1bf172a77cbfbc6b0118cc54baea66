SENATE  Deputy Chief Whip Francis Alimikhena has said he has no plan to leave the All Progressive Congress (APC) for another party. He said the Ihonvbere Campaign organisation is peddling rumours about defection to discredit him ahead of the APC primary. In a statement, he said: “Edo state will be having all 3 Senators in the Peoples Democratic Party soon as report has it that Sen Francis Alimikhena is negotiating return to PDP. “ The senator cautioned the Ihonvbere Campaign Organisation against endangering the peace and unity in Edo North APC. Alimikhena said he is not afraid to face Prof. Ihonvbere at the senatorial primary. He said the people are aware of his achievements as a senator. Alimikhena frowned at the publication linking him with defection, saying it was a deliberate attempt to create disunity between him and his leader, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. He said he would rather resigned from active politics than joining the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to fight against  Oshiomhole.
