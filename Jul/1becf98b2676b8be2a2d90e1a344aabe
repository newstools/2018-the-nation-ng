The Police yesterday warned cult groups against gathering on Saturday to foment trouble in some parts of Lagos State. In a statement, the police said they had information that groups such as Aiye, Eye, Black Axe and Buccaneers, among others, had been sending notice on rival gangs of their planned gathering on Saturday. It said the venue of the gathering was not disclose. It was learnt that the 7th day of the 7th month is sacred to these outlaws. The statement signed by police spokesman Chike Oti, a Chief Superintendent (CSP), said it was also the day cultists settled scores. It is also a day of outright brigandage and anomie, the police added. The police warned that such gatherings would be viewed as an unlawful assembly with the intent to commit felony. Oti said: “Commissioner of Police Imohimi Edgal reiterates that no cult group will be allowed to compromise the peace daily nurtured by men and women of goodwill in the state and maintained by the police. He urged members of the public to blow the whistle on these brigands anywhere they are found. Edgal enjoined parents to warn their children, who are members of these nefarious associations not only to renounce cultism, but to denounce it in all its ramifications.”
