A presidential aspirant on the Not Too Young to Run platform, Omoyele Sowore, on Thursday described the Senate as a drain pipe on the nations’ resources. Sowore, who is the Publisher of Sahara Reporters, said members of the current Senate “are old and retired top civil servants who are out to siphon the nation’s resources to the detriment of the downtrodden.” He said the Federal Government spends a whopping N1 trillion yearly as salaries and emoluments including constituency allowances, stressing that the huge amount should have been channel to education and other projects that would benefit Nigerians. He argued that the current presidential system of government is capital intensive, saying if elected as president in 2019, he would opt for a unicameral legislature where the lawmakers would serve on part- time basis and free funds for developmental programmes. According to Sowore, his regime would be a departure from previous administrations because he would ensure fulfillment of election promises and defend his integrity by marching words with actions. He regretted that the country’s zoning system has repeatedly failed “because it is a lazy man’s approach to politics” and should be jettisoned. He said: ”We have rotated power based on religion, ethnicity, and region which has failed us. Therefore, leaders who are based in the North do not have the interest of Northerners at heart likewise the South West and South East. Therefore what we are looking for in Nigeria is a leader who has the interest of the masses at heart, irrespective of where he comes from.” ”Wicked politicians have hijacked the affairs of this country. They have succeeded in bastardizing the country by using the so-called zoning formula. If not, what is currently happening on Borno, Benue, Plateau and Zamfara States is a far cry from what the North deserves from Northern leaders.”
