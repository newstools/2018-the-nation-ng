The exercise is part of measures to curb incessant fire in private and public places. The Ministry of the Special Duties and Inter governmental Relations Permanent Secretary, Dr Jemilade Longe, who flagged off the exercise, reiterated the governmentâ€™s commitment to safety. The sensitisation, he said, was timely considering the increasing incidence of fire. Acting Director, Lagos Fire Service Rasaki Musibau said the yearly event exposed public servants to measures to take in handling emergencies and ensuring that safety equipment were in good condition. According to him, effective knowledge of fire safety information would help reduce fatalities, injuries and destruction of property. He advised the public not to underestimate any fire no matter how small. He urged the trainees to share the knowledge acquired with their friends and families for the safety of all. The trainees were exposed to proper handling of fire safety tools, importance of roll call during emergencies (to ascertain that all heads are counted), use of emergency exit and many more.
