The President of Women Arise, Dr. Joe Okei-Odumakin, said on Saturday the Ekiti State governorship election would be a litmus test for the country. Addressing journalists in Afao, she urged politicians to respect wishes of the electorates. She said the Ekiti governorship election was conducted under peaceful ambience, adding that the skirmishes recorded in few places were not enough to discredit the exercise. Okei-Odumakin, who is a member of election observers’ group in the state, said there was tension in the build up to the election, stressing that the outcome so far belittled the apprehension. The right activist expressed optimism that Ekiti people would not deviate from the quest of making the election a success. She said: “So far, the process has been impressive and commendable. The process will help to restore credibility to the election. Initially, we were worried about the conduct of the election, but as it is the process is commendable. “The voters conducted themselves in orderly manner. I must say most of the people have imbibed the spirit of June 12 and one can see the ambience of peace in most of the polling booths.” Okei-Odumakin said areas where problems occurred could be improved upon ahead of future elections. “We have reports of technical issues which is also not enough to discredit the polls outcome. There was the case of a card reader not capturing the fingerprint of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, the case of the wife of the All Progress Congress (APC) candidate, Bisi Fayemi and the Accord Party candidate. “Ekiti is going to be the litmus test for coming elections. Don’t forget we have the Osun State election close by and the 2019 election. The outcome of the election will go a long way to defining the image of the country.”
