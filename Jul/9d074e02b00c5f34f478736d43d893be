An Ebute Meta Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded a man, Henry Anaele, accused of beating his wife to death over N200. He will remain in prison for 30 days, pending advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Anaele, 40, pleaded not guilty. Prosecuting Inspector Cousin Adams said the accused committed the offence on June 15 at about 11.45 p.m, at 72, Goodness Estate, Satellite Town, Lagos. Adams said the accused found out that someone gave his wife Chinyere, 35, N200, and that did not go down well with him. “This angered the accused who beat his wife to death for collecting the money,’’ he said. The offence contravened Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 which prescribes death penalty. The magistrate adjourned till August 6.
