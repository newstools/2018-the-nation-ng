Super Eagles’ duo, Oghenekaro Etebo and Daniel Akpeyi have been named in a formal petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission [EFCC] against their former employers, Warri Wolves. Etebo and Akpeyi played for Warri Wolves in the Nigeria Professional Football League [NPFL] before the club’s relegation to the lower division. The 2018 World Cup returnees are among 34 names in a case by “several” aggrieved former Warri Wolves players seeking payment of salaries and bonuses since 2014 to the tune of ?300m. Etebo played for two seasons between 2013 and 2015, while Akpeyi played for the Seasiders for just one season. Some other Nigeria internationals named in the list include Abu Azeez, Stanley Dimgba and Azubuike Egwuekwe. According to Core TV, former players of NNL side Warri Wolves write EFCC over the failure of the management of the club to pay them their salaries and sign on fee worth over N200 million since 2014. After leaving the Delta state-based club, Etebo has played in Portugal and Spain. He recently signed a long-term deal with English Championship side, Stoke City. Akpeyi joined South African club, Chippa United after he left in 2015.
