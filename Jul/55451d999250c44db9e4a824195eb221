A Kenyan referee who had been due to officiate at the ongoing World Cup in Russia has been handed a life ban after being caught in a bribery sting. Aden Marwa was filmed receiving a 600-dollar bribe during Confederation of African Football (CAF) assignment in Ghana. He is one of 22 referees sanctioned by the CAF in an unprecedented clean up, announced at the weekend. Marwa, who was a reserve at the 2014 finals in Brazil, had earlier been removed from the list of match officials due to officiate in Russia. The life ban was handed out by CAFâ€™s disciplinary board, which also banned 10 other referees for between two years and 10 years for similar offences. A further 11 persons have been suspended pending an appearance at the board in August. African football has long been plagued by allegations of bribery but never before has CAF banned such a large number of officials.
