A 52- year-old trader, Emeka Nwobochi, who allegedly defiled a 14-year-old boy was on Wednesday remanded at the Kirikiri Prisons, Lagos, by an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. Magistrate Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi, who refused to take plea of the accused, said he should be kept behind bars pending advice from the State Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). Nwobochi, whose address was not given, is being tried for defilement. The prosecutor, ASP. Ezekiel Ayorinde, told the court that the accused committed the offence on June 29, at Maza Maza Park, Lagos. Ayorinde said that the accused sexually assaulted a 14-year-old boy through anus. “The accused assaulted the teenager by penetrating into his anus with his sex organ,” he said. He said the accused brought the boy from Abia. “The accused brought the boy from village with the pretext of sending him to school, because the boy’s father died and was abandoned by his mother who had remarried. “But instead, he turned him into a sex machine. “When the boy could no longer bear the pains, he told someone who reported the case to the police which led to the arrest of the accused.” The offence violated Section 261 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The Section 261 prescribes life imprisonment for offenders. The case was adjourned until for Aug. 13, for mention. NAN
