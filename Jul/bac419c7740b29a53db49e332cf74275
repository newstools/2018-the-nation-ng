The National Youth Service Corps said on Monday that it has launched an investigation into an alleged fake exemption certificate in possession of Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun. The organisation, in a three paragraph statement issued on Monday by its Director, Press and Public Relations, Adeyemi Adenike, confirmed that the minister applied for an exemption certificate from the NYSC. The statement reads: “Our attention has been drawn to the issue of the alleged forgery of an NYSC Exemption Certificate by the Honorable Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun. “Checking our records, Mrs. Adeosun did apply for an Exemption Certificate. “We shall investigate the origin of the purported Exemption Certificate in question.” An online publication, Premium Times had reported that the Minister skipped the mandatory one year national service and obtained a forged exemption certificate. Adeosun is yet to respond to the publication at press time.
