Serena Williams will face Germany’s Angelique Kerber for an eighth Wimbledon singles title after both won their semi-finals in straight sets. The American former world number one overpowered Germany’s Julia Gorges 6-2 6-4, while Kerber beat Latvia’s Jelena Ostapenko 6-3 6-3. Saturday’s final will be a re-match of the 2016 showpiece, which Williams won. Williams will be seeking a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam title and her first since giving birth in September. Williams was in control from the outset against 13th seed Gorges, who was making her Grand Slam semi-final debut. It was the first time at these championships that the American had faced a player ranked in the top 50 and she stepped up with a powerful display that also showed better movement around the court than in previous rounds.
