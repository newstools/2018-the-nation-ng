VICE-Chancellor, Caleb University, Imota near Lagos Prof. Ayandiji Aina, said yesterday that private universities are able to produce many first class because they adhere to their carrying-capacity and are quality-driven in terms of admission. Aina spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos, in a reaction to the National University Commission (NUC) 2017 reports, which indicated that private universities produced more first class graduates than the public universities. The report had since attracted critics from various scholars and quarters on the possibilities of the private universities lowering or compromising on standards to increase enrolment. The VC said first class students produced by private universities merited their degrees and had proved it again in other areas.  Aina said: “People say we are producing many first class graduates in the private university and I ask them if they have assessed the students to know if they are lower in quality. “There is no way a student will make first class and I have to regulate him or her down to second class because I want to graduate less number of first class. “There are cases of second class upper students of private universities making first class in the law school and that is an endorsement for us.”
