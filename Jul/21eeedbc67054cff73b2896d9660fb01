Residents of Ojo Street in Akoka, Yaba, Lagos Mainland, have raised the alarm over a caterpillar abandoned under a power line in the area. The caterpillar, has been blocking half of the road in the past three months. A resident, Doyin Adenugba, said the caterpillar was a safety threat. “If the power line touches the caterpillar, it could lead to an explosion and set buildings on fire. We are living with an impending fire outbreak,” he said. Another resident, Olorunshola Folusho, said that the caterpillar was abandoned on the street over three months ago. “There is an ongoing construction, like four buildings away from where the caterpillar is abandoned. Those doing the construction brought the caterpillar to the site over three months, but I learnt the caterpillar did not work, so it was abandoned where it is till today. “This caterpillar is very close to the power line, if heavy rain should fall, the line can drop on the caterpillar; anyone that touches the caterpillar can be electrocuted, it can also cause fire outbreak,” he said. Ayo Akinshola said the power line was about three meters to the caterpillar. “Residents now live in fear anytime it rains. Once it rains, residents are faced with fear of electric shock or hazard, because of the water on the floor. The presence of this abandoned caterpillar is dangerous to the community,” he said. Akinshola called on the government to help move the caterpillar to avert disaster.
