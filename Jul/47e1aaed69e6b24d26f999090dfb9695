Serial award winner, Simi, is gradually writing her name in the sands of time as she keeps waxing stronger even more than those who were there before her in the music industry.  Now, the sensational X3M music act has scored another feather by releasing a powerful video of her song Aimasiko, featuring legend, Evangelist Ebenezer Obey.  The video, also starring Simi’s band, The Banjos, wraps up the visuals to tracks off her album, Simisola.  Shot and directed by Ani James of Aje Filmworks, Aimasiko highlights daily struggles in life as people search for solutions to their different problems while praying for God’s intervention.
