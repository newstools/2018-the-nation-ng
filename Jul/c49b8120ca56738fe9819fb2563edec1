•Lawyer alleges senator was abducted A Senior Magistrate’s Court in Kogi State has adjourned the trial of Senator Dino Melaye (Kogi West) and two others in the case of illegal possession of firearms and arms dealing till August 9. Senior Magistrate Sulyman Abdullah adjourned the case yesterday’s sitting for beginning of trial as the prosecution could not open its case due to absence of its lead counsel, Dr. Alex Izinyon. Mr. Theophilus Oteme, the Officer in Charge of Legal Department of Kogi State Police Command, told the court that the lead prosecuting counsel, Izinyon had an emergency call on Wednesday that made it impossible for him to appear in court yesterday. Oteme, therefore, applied for an adjournment until September 23 for the beginning of trial in view of the absence of the lead prosecutor and more so, that one of the defendants (Melaye) was not in court. However, the lead counsel to Melaye, Chief Mike Ozekhome, represented by Mr. Yemi Mohammed, told the court that he had on good authority that Melaye was attacked in Gwagwalada on his way to Lokoja. “I learnt that he was attacked yesterday (Wednesday) in Gwagwalada on his way to Lokoja to attend his trial and up till now, I have not been able to reach him. I don’t know where he is at the moment,’’ he said. In his ruling, Abdullah turned down the application by the prosecution for a long adjournment to September 23. He said the Kogi State Administration of Criminal Justice Law did not allow for an adjournment beyond two weeks in a criminal case. The Senior Magistrate, therefore, adjourned the case until August 9 and ordered that the bail earlier granted to Melaye continued. Abdullah, however, ruled that the other two accused persons, Nuhu Salihu, known as “small’’ and Kabiru Seidu also known as “Osama’’, standing trial on a seven-count charge bordering on illegal possession of firearms and arms dealing, should continue with their remand in police custody.
