“My wife can beg for the Nigeria. I don’t mean begging I mean apologisng. She apologizes even when I am wrong,her sorry is beginning to irritate me . I cheated on her with our neighbour’s daughter and she saw all the evidences, even the girls mum came to harass me and my wife kept covering for me. After the drama she came to beg me. I was irritated. I asked her, why are you apologizing and she said because she loves me, why can’t she wait for me to beg her when I wrong her. Why is she always playing the fool? So today, she saw a message on my phone, it was a message I sent to my side chick and she confronted me, I tried to explain to her and she got upset, as I was about leaving the house, she started begging me again. Telling me that she is not angry again. I tried to push her away, she held me and I slapped her by mistake. Expecting her to let me go but she held my shirt and kept begging. I felt pity for her but at the same time I was irritated. Why is she acting all desperate? I love a woman that can be quite hard, not a foot mat. How do I go about this? I want her to stop apologizing sheepishly.”   BOM
