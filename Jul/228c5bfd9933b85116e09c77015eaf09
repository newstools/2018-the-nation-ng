Niger state government has disclosed that it owes N664 million to the two major examination bodies in the country, the West Africa Examination Council (WAEC) and the National Examination Council (NECO). The state Commissioner of Education, Hajiya Fatima Magudu who told journalists in Minna on Monday explained that the debt was inherited by the government from its predecessors. It would be recalled that The Nation reported that students in the state public schools have not been able to access their WEAC results due to the debts owed to the examination body. Students and parents have been worried and have besieged the WAEC office in Minna demanding for reasons why the results cannot be accessed and they were directed to the state Ministry of Education to get explanations. However, the Commissioner disclosed that five million had been given to WAEC to offset this year’s bill to enable the students’ access their results. She said that the balance of the other debts is gradually being repaid by the state government.
