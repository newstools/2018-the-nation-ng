 Juventus new sign Cristiano Ronaldo has headed for China in style to observe his Annual CR7 tour. The Portugal international whose breath taking strikes against Spain at the just ended World cup in Russia remains a talking point, has made a frequent event of his CR7 tour in recent years, travelling to Asisa to meet his global fans and further expand his brand. The £100million man took to social media on Wednesday, just a few days after completing his move to Seria A side Juve, to alert his Chinese fans that he is on his way. Posing with his entourage in front of a plush, Nike-branded jet, Ronaldo was in high spirits while preparing for yet another adventure. The 33-year-old is set to be in for a hectic summer with sponsorship commitments before finally getting down to some pre-season training with his new club. Ronaldo is likely to miss Juventus’ upcoming pre-season tour of America, and so avoid a very early reunion with Real Madrid who will face the Old Lady at the FedEx Field stadium in Maryland. The forward had to cut short a family holiday to Greece, which he had been taking following Portugal’s exit from the World Cup, in order to seal his transfer. It is unknown how long the player and his party will be spending in China, though Ronaldo is likely to visit several occasions for public visits and Nike-organised events. Once his heavy summer dies down, Ronaldo is in line to make his first appearance in the famous black and white stripes of Juventus on the first weekend of the Serie season. The fixtures for the Italian top flight are to be announced on Friday, where Ronaldo will learn who are set to be his first opponents.
