A nursing mother and 154 out of 230 Nigerian football fans stranded in Russia after the 2018 FIFA World Cup arrived the country on Friday night. The stranded football fans, including a nursing mother in her mid- thirties came through Ethiopian Airline flight number ET-ALP which arrived Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport Abuja at about 9.12 pm. The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, who was at the airport to monitor their arrival, lauded President Muhammadu Buhari’s effort to ensure their safe return. Onyeama said Buhari had directed Nigerians stranded in Russia after the 2018 World Cup tournament, should be evacuated immediately. He said he had been working very closely with the Minister of State for Aviation following President Buhari’s directive on the exercise. He recalled that some Nigerian football fans stranded had besieged the Embassy of Nigeria in Moscow on July 12. The minister explained that there was also an allegation that some airline travel agents cancelled return tickets of their customers without informing them. According to him, the Nigerian Mission had been supportive by making arrangements for the feeding and accommodation of the stranded Nigerians in hostels around Moscow. One of the returnees, Bamidele Fatai, was full of praises to Buhari for making their journey possible. Another returnee, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was swindled by an agent who cancelled his return ticket. He said he was in Moscow to support the Nigerian Football Team and catch fun only to discover his ticket had been cancelled when he was ready to return home.
