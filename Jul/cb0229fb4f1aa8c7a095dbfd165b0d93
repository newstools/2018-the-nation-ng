THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) yesterday arraigned Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Deputy National Chairman (South) Yemi Akinwonmi at the Federal High Court in Lagos for alleged N179.8 million fraud. He was arraigned along with two Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) officials, Dickson Atiba and Ogunmodede Oladayo. They were accused of conspiring to take possession of the money in March 2015 ahead of the general elections. EFCC arraigned them before Justice Muslim Hassan, who ordered that they be remanded in Ikoyi Prison pending hearing of their bail application. The prosecution said they received the money from Adeyinka Ayo-Aina, when they “reasonably ought to have known that the money formed part of proceeds of fraud”. According to the commission, they handled the cash without going through a financial institution, thereby violating the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011. The prosecution said Akinwonmi, a former INEC staff, and Atiba, on or about April 7, 2015, made and accepted a cash payment of N69 million. It added that the sum “exceeded the amount authorised by law without going through a financial institution”. EFCC said the alleged offence is contrary to Section 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011, as amended and punishable under Section 16(2). Akinwonmi, Atiba and Oladayo pleaded not guilty to the eight-count charge filed by prosecuting counsel Mr. Rotimi Oyedepo. Justice Hassan adjourned until August 6 for hearing of their bail applications.
