More than 100 youths will benefit from Black Fragrance Foundation business initiative. Speaking on the initiative, the initiator of the foundation, Mr. Emmanuel Akapo, said the foundation was founded to support the creative economy by empowering youths in technical skills such as web designs, games and mobile apps design, fashion design, interior and event decor, photography, shoe and bag making and many other things. Akapo said the overriding interest in floating the foundation was to empower youths on business enterprise to could help them excel in life. “First, the name Black Fragrance, many thought it is a perfume. The idea is this: black is synonymous with Africa and Africa is known for a lot of negative things. I was thinking of repackaging or remodelling Africa to have a sweet smell, a beautiful aroma; there is also a love fragrance that can come from Africa. “On how do we achieve our goal by supporting and facilitating quality education for out of school children, don’t forget the umbrella organization is a foundation. What we are doing here is a pure social enterprise, a form of business that makes money like every other business. The difference between a social enterprise and a commercial enterprise is that a social enterprise takes a big chunk of their profit and put in the society, that is what makes a social enterprise. So, people will pay tuition fees to come. “We are also giving 100 scholarships for the less privileged.  Like I said, I gave 10 to Ijesa community. We have 10 students already who are not paying a dime in our neigbourhood. It is about distribution, those who have. A course of three months is seventy-five thousand naira, to also school here is zero naira, it depends on who you are. So, we are going to have a minimum of 100 non-paying students every year.
