*Gov Ikpeazu leads Stadium inspection Confederation Cup campaigners Enyimba are on the verge of returning to their base after Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu led a team that includes former Super Eagles defender Uche Okechukwu to inspect the Aba Stadium on Friday.
The Aba Township Stadium which has been under renovation for some time now forcing the Peoples Elephant to play home matches away looks set for action not only for the remainder of their Confederation cup campaign but also ahead of resumption of the premier league season currently in the cooler following the ongoing brouhaha at the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). The league had initially been put on hold to accommodate the World cup in Russia but is yet to resume 12 days after the end of the World Cup.
Enyimba who will be facing Ivorian side WILLIAMSVILLE ATHLETIC CLUB (WAC) on Sunday in continuation of the Continental campaign, are leading the Group C with 6 points and will be aiming to consolidate when they file out against the Ivorians on Sunday. 
Enyimba in the first leg defeated WAC by a lone goal at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium Port Harcourt, a result considered in some quarters to be too slim for comfort ahead of Sunday’s return leg. Ibrahim Mustapha who scored the only goal in Port Harcourt will hoping convert another opportunity in Abidjan if the Aba side is to have a smooth passage.
Paul Aigbogun who was in charge when Enyimba claim the slim victory against WAC only recently resigned his appointment with first Assistant Usman Abd’allah now charged with the responsibility of piloting the team.
