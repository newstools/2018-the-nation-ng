The Federal University, Lokoja, said on Monday said it has expelled 13 students over examination leakage. Many of the expelled students were final year students of Department of Economics. Making the clarifications over allegations of unjust expulsion by one of the affected students, Lydia Lawal,  a 400 -level student of the Department of Economics, the Vice Chancellor of the institution, Prof. Angela Freeman Miri, said Lawal and other students were expelled over leakage of examination papers in 2017. She said the institution’s disciplinary panel would decide the fate of employees that were allegedly involved in the scandal. The VC said: “I can say in the affirmative that these students were expelled from the school before the second convocation in 2017 over alleged exam leakage. “Those involved were final year students in the Economics Department. They were suspended and due process was thereafter followed. “We set up a disciplinary committee and the examination misconduct panel and the matter was sent to the Senate. “At the second to fourth Senate meeting, two weeks ago, the Senate sat on the matter and took the decision. It was on that basis that the Senate took its decision and expulsion letters handed to the affected students.”
