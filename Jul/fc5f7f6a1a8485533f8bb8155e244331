A member of House of Representatives, representing Kusada/Ingawa/Kankia federal constituency, Alhaji Ahmed Baba Kaita, has picked up the APC ticket for Katsina North Senatorial District to contest the bye-election scheduled by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for the zone by August 11 Kaita defeated other 10 contestants at the keenly contested party primaries involving about 4000 delegates held at Daura Motel, which ended at about 1.53 am this morning His closest rivals Nasiru Sani Zango, 1474, and Engineer Mustapha kanti who scored 317 votes, as well as the remaining contestants, all pledged to work for the victory of the party at the polls expected to hold in less than two weeks from now The total votes cast at the primaries were 3,879 with 91 invalid votes and the withdrawal of a candidate, Kabir Abdullahi, alias ‘’Change’’ from the contest Meanwhile after what some party officials described as a failed plot to impose a “consensus” candidate for the vacant Katsina North senatorial seat at the National Assembly, leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) succumbed to the primaries election process option, to produce a candidate to contest along with other political parties in the area The Nation recalled that the Senate seat became vacant following the demise of the then incumbent, the late Senator Mustapha Bukar, last April. The Independent National Electoral Commission has since fixed August 11 for the conduct of a by-election to fill the position. Party delegates from across 12 local government areas in the zone converged on the Daura Motel to choose a candidate from the 11 contestants who participated in the primaries Reports indicate that Masari had visited both the accreditation and voting venues at midnight and commended the level of preparation for the polls. The APC had earlier fixed Wednesday, July 25, for the conduct of the poll but later shifted the date as none of the contestants agreed to step down for the emergence of a consensus candidate through “affirmation.” The Nation further learnt that not even Governor Aminu Bello Masari could convince the contestants to abandon the voting process. According to a competent party source, “we held series of meetings and all of them ended in deadlock. The last meeting was with the Governor at the Government House which dragged on into the early hours of Thursday morning and at the end, it was agreed that we conduct the primaries. The Governor made case for the emergence of a consensus candidate but it did not work out.”
