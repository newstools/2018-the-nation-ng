The Senate on Thursday asked the Nigeria Police Force and other security agencies to dismantle multiple roadblocks mounted along major highways in the South East geo-political zone. The upper chamber mandated its Committee on Works to take a tour of federal roads in the zone to ensure compliance with the directive without further delay. The resolution followed the adopting a motion presented by the Senator representing Abia North, Mao Ohuabunwa, on matter of urgent national importance. Ohuabunwa said the proliferation of roadblocks in the area was affecting the free flow of people, goods and services in the zone. He wondered why multiple roadblocks would be mounted in an area that does not necessarily need them. According to him, the roadblocks are seen by the people as instrument of intimidation and harassment. Senator Victor Umeh, (Anambra Central), who seconded the motion, said the roadblocks have  become a huge embarrassment to the people of the zone. Umeh said: “The proliferation of roadblocks in the South East by security agencies is becoming a huge embarrassment. It is killing businesses in the region. Our people who are business oriented can no longer ply their trade. “In the South East, we are not in any imminent danger. I don’t see the need why we should have more road blocks in the area. Sometimes, you have roadblocks in a distance of about 300 metres. “Security is important. But it should not be abused. Our people are complaining and we need to correct this. Our people now spend more time on the road because of these unnecessary roadblocks.” Senate President, Bukola Saraki, asked the Committee on Police Affairs and Army, to visit the affected areas and report back to the Senate for further legislative action.
