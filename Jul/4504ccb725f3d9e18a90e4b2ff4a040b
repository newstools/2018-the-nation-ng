…Says prosecution did not prove case  The Supreme Court has dismissed the charge of false assets declaration brought against the Senate President, Bukola Saraki before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). Justice Centus Chima Nweze, in a lead judgment of a five-ma panel, upheld Saraki’s appeal, set aside the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove its case. The Court of Appeal had, in a December 12, 2017judgement, held that the prosecution established a prema facie case against Saraki on three out of the 18 counts contained in the charge and ordered him to enter defence in relation to the three counts. The apex court dismissed the entire charge and held that the prosecution failed to discharge its responsibility of proving its case. The apex court upheld the June 14, 2017 ruling of the CCT, which freed Saraki. It was of the view that all the evidence presented by the prosecution were hear-say evidence and therefore not admissible.

The court after discharging Saraki, proceeded to also dismissed the cross-appeal filed by the prosecution. Other members of the panel were Justices Dattijo Mohammed, John Okoro, Amina Augie and Ejembi Eko.   Details later…
