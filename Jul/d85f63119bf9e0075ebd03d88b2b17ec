Young gospel singer Adekunle Adebayo has said there is a need for gospel singers to have a breaking ground in churches where they have spent time developing themselves. In a chat with The Nation, Adebayo who started out his musical journey in The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) said he is well-known within Lagos Province 10 but “the challenges we are having is that the churches are yet to see the important of promoting those of us who are really into music as individuals. “But when it comes to promoting and projecting them to the world, there is yet to be a platform for that. Most time, I feel reluctant to tell people that I am a full time gospel artiste and that is because most of us promote ourselves.” Not yet signed to a record label, the artiste revealed that he is yet to find one that can reckon with his kind of music. “I am yet to get a record label that can relate with my kind of music. Most tend to change your style and I do not want that. This is who I am and I would want to be known with it. And I am yet to lose hope. “Another challenge is the marketers, I have been to some of them and their responses are not encouraging for someone that is just coming up. So for now I do the marketing myself and it is not usually what you expect when you take your work to events, with hope of selling out”. Describing his genre of music, Ewi (hailing God), Adebayo who has two albums – ‘Olorun Emimo’ and ‘Olorun Aperere’ – said “it is called eulogizing God in a different way. My kind of music is used to help people known the names of God, which draw them closer to Him.”
