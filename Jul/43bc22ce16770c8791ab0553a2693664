…to train 124 M.Sc, 77PhD in Euorpe, China  The Executive Secretary, Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF), Dr. Bello Aliyu Gusau, Monday explained that the fund stopped selecting students for oversea training by aptitude test because it is not a good measure of their capacity. Speaking at the induction ceremony in Abuja, he disclosed that 124 Masters of Science (M.Sc) and 77 PhD students that are to undergo training in China, Germany and France. He recalled that “hitherto, we subjected students to just one hour aptitude test. But we felt that is not a good measure of their capacity. So, what we did is get to see after four years of staying in the university what quality of degree do you have. “If you have a First Class we know you are good and more than somebody who has Second Class Lower. If you have Second Class Upper, you are going to earn in our marking more than somebody, who has Second Class Lower. That was how we ended up with the list we came up with. So, 70% of the marks they got were based on those documents.” According to him, the students are scheduled to embark on their journey to commence their studies as soon as their visas are ready. He advised them that the training transcends acquisition of certificate to skills and expertise for contribution to national development. He tasked them on returning to deploy their skills in Nigeria, adding that they should bear in mind that they are representing the nation. The PTDF boss said “how you comport yourselves in those countries tells on the image of this country.” He assured the students that PTDF would transmit the rules governing overseas trainings to them. Gusau said that the number of students that the Fund is sponsoring in Nigerian universities is four times of the inducted oversea students. He maintained that in order to domesticate the training, PTDF patronizes Nigerians universities for training of under-graduates.
