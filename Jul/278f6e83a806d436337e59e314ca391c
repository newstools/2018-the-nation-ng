Lagos State Government yesterday skills acquisition is the only way to self-employment. Commissioner for Wealth Creation and Employment Mrs Uzamat Akinbile-Yusuff said this during a mentorship programme for the youth to embrace skills acquisition. She said: “Lagos State is solving a critical problem, which is unemployment. This problem is created by the belief that every young graduate must seek employment, forgetting that we can only get employed if we create employment. ”The question everybody is asking, is ”how do we create employment?’ We’ve got an answer to that question which is learn a skill and earn a living.” According to Akinbile-Yusuff, there is huge rate of unemployment in the country because many young university graduates lack the practical skills to make them self-employed. She urged the participants to take advantage of financial services provided by the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) to grow their businesses. The Acting Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Mr Sam Ajibade urged the participants to make good use of the knowledge acquired and become entrepreneurs.
