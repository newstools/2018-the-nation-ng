Gombe State Governor Ibrahim Dankwambo has urged northerners living in Delta State to live peaceable by respecting the culture and norms of their hosts. He spoke at the weekend when he inaugurated projects executed by his Delta State counterpart Ifeanyi Okowa. Dankwambo opened the Abavo Circular Road, Abavo Phase 1, with a spur to Ogbekile Street in Ika South Local Government Area, and Owerre-Olubor/Ekwuoma Road in Ika North-East council. He said: “The Arewa Community should live in peace with the host community; you must not do anything that is against the norms and culture of the communities, they should preach peace and accommodating spirit to their children and the host communities must be their brothers’ keepers, we must live as a peaceful, united people in this country.” Dankwanbo also inspected facilities at the Stephen Keshi Stadium and was surprised that within three years, Okowa has achieved a lot, emphasising that: “for a new government faced with the challenges of funds to be inaugurating projects, my brother, Governor Okowa, I hail you.” He said: “The facilities we have inspected are of international standards, no wonder Delta State is always emerging as number one in sporting competitions.” Okowa said: “The need to build bridges of friendship across the country to strengthen our unity as a people was the reason I invited Governor Dankwambo to inaugurate projects executed by his administration. “We are proud as a government that we are taking road projects to different communities, especially, to our people in the riverine communities; we will continue to work for our people. “We thank our traditional rulers for ensuring peaceful kingdoms which have helped us to execute projects.”
