Super Eagles’ and Leicester City speedster Ahmed Musa took to his Instagram page late on Thursday evening to announce the arrival of a new baby into his family, AOIFootball.com reports. Already with a son and daughter with his former wife, the former CSKA Moscow forward who married his new wife Juliet Elue in July 2017 welcomed the addition of his new son to the family. “I would like to announce to you all that moments ago Allah blessed me with a beautiful baby boy! Words cannot describe this feeling!?? ?? ??” he posted. Meanwhile, Musa has applauded fans despite losing the 2018 World Cup best goal award to France defender Benjamin Pavard. The Leicester City forward’s second goal for Nigeria in their 2-0 victory over Iceland was shortlisted along 17 others for the individual prize. And on Wednesday, FIFA announced Pavard’s stunner against Argentina as the best in the tournament with Musa’s effort settling for the eighth spot. The former VVV Venlo man then took to the social media to appreciate his supporters for voting for him. “I just want to thank you all for voting. This goal is bigger than me it has shown the world that Nigeria has quality on the world stage and we look to improve in the future,” Musa wrote on Twitter.
