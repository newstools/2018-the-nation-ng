The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) on Sunday warned members of the public and traders in particular, against encroaching on rail tracks while doing their businesses to avert accidents. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the NRC was speaking against the backdrop of three persons killed at a railway crossing in Lagos on Friday. NAN recalls that three persons were killed while many others sustained injuries after a train hit a commercial bus at Pen Cinema railway crossing. Mr Jerry Oche, NRC Lagos District Manager, said it was regrettable that people had refused to heed the corporation’s warnings on the dangers of trading or driving carelessly on rail tracks. “The railway tracks are not walkways nor parking lots, or market space for trading. “People have no business being on the tracks unless they are railway staff on the track for maintenance,’’ Oche said. He said that some people have been killed on the tracks because they put on their earpiece and could not hear the train honk. “It is dangerous for anyone to walk on the train tracks with an earpiece. “Despite our warnings, people still walk with earpiece, trading and some driving carelessly on rail tracks knowing very well that trains have the right of way on the tracks,’’ the district manager said. NAN recalls that Mr Raji Oladimeji, a witness of the Pen Cinema accident, said the accident occurred when the bus driver was trying to make a U-turn on the rail line. “We warned the driver not to make the U-turn at that particular point when a train was approaching, but he refused. “So, it was in the process of making the turn that the train crushed the bus and people hanging on the train fell off and three died instantly while others sustained various injuries,” Oladimeji said.
