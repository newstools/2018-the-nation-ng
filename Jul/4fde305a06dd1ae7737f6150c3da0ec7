France are through to the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup after securing a 2-0 victory over Uruguay. Raphael Varane headed France into a first-half lead, and a terrible mistake from goalkeeper Fernando Muslera, saw him fail to save a shot from Antoine Griezmann, booking Les Blues to their first semi-finals since 2006. The world was treated to a dull footballing from the twenty-two players on the pitch, but the French have Hugo Lloris to thank for producing a world-class save Martin Caceres, shortly after Varane’s goal in the first half. Diego Godin blasted the rebound he got from that save. The second half started with France continuing to control possession, but they were gifted the goal that made certain of their victory. There seemed little danger when Griezmann let fly from the edge of the area but Muslera misjudged the flight of the ball, flapped at the shot, and saw it loop slowly over the line. It was Griezmann’s third goal of the 2018 World Cup, his first from open play. The drama in Nizhny Novgorod continued when when Kylian Mbappe fell to the floor. Uruguay skipper Diego Godin gestured with the teenager to get up, pulling him from the turf. This caused a little fight involing most of the players and saw French coach Didier Deschamps come onto the pitch to try to calm tempers. A likely repeat of the 1998 FIFA World Cup final will happen again in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday 10th July, if Brazil beat Belgium in the next quarter-final match, as France await the winner between the Samba Boys and star-studded Belgium
