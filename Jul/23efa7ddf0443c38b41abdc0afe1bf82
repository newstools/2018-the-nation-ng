Students of Kogi State University (KSU) on Monday staged a peaceful protest against the “No fees, No Exams” policy restricting students from writing the ongoing semester examination in the varsity. According to the Public Relations Officer of the Students Union Government (SUG), Emmanuel Thomas “The school management has earlier passed a memoranda of understanding to inform the students beforehand in order to ensure strict adherence on or before the stipulated time for the examination.” Thomas further expressed his gratitude to the school management for their cooperation and urged the students to comply with the directive in order to achieve a mutually beneficial relationship. “Students should adhere strictly to the school management’s directive as efforts have been made to see that all students write the ongoing exams.” The students, who took to the Idachaba Lecture Theater of the institution, disrupted those writing Exam before returning to other faculties of the institution to continue the agitation. One of the protesters, who spoke on the condition of anonymity with our reporter, said “Some students were denied access to the Examination hall today in spite of the fact that the state government led by Governor Yahaya Bello has not paid workers.” Another aggrieved student who don’t want to be mentioned said “Some students who had not fully paid their school fees were the ones protesting and the School management has been so determined to ensure strict adherence to the “No School Fees, No Exams” policy.” According to him, “The students should have been allowed to write the ongoing examinations because the government has failed to play their role by paying our parents as at when due.” In a recent development, the school management has passed a memo to allow defaulters write the exams on a condition deemed fit for the students to comply with if they must be considered.
