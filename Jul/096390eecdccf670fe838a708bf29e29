A former Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Funsho Kupolokun, wants the Yoruba to give their language a boost by encouraging its use at home. He spoke in Abeokuta during the launch of a book on Yoruba proverbs titled ‘Atupale Owe Yoruba’. He said the use of the language should also be encouraged at meetings wherever the Yoruba gather. Kupolokun lauded the author of the book, Mr. Sunday Sofolahan, a lawyer, for contributing his quota towards encouraging the understanding and speaking of the language by the present and future generations of Yoruba people. The author, in his remarks, urged the Ogun State House of Assembly to enact a law to make the teaching of Yoruba a compulsory subject in public primary and secondary schools in the State. He warned that except the stakeholders take the issue of teaching and encouraging speaking Yoruba seriously in homes, offices and schools, the language may go into extinction.
