NEYA Iyere, nee Orji Kalu, the daughter of the former Governor of Abia State, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, and her husband, Lawrence, are expecting their first child. The couple got married at a grand wedding ceremony last December. Neya, who is the heiress to the Orji Uzor Kalu dynasty, we gathered, is already counting days awaiting the arrival of the tiny patter of feet. To say the CEO of Jus Human Beauty Spa, Abuja, is the apple of her fatherâ€™s eyes is stating the obvious. Little wonder, the former governor named his country home in the sleepy town of Igbere, Abia State, as Camp Neya.
