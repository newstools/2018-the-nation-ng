Speaking on the ongoing process, the Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, Mr. Rotimi Oyekanmi, told our correspondent that candidates’ names will be published on Monday. Speaking also, Prince Solomon Soyebi, a National Commissioner and Chairman Publicity and Voter Education Committee, said the process was still ongoing as parties are granted the opportunity to substitute their candidates where necessary in accordance with the electoral law. “There is room for substitution. There are processes and they are ongoing. It is not a finished product yet,” he said.
