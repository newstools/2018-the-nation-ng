 Russia 2018 world cup Runner-up Coach, Zlatko Dalic has dropped a request for increased salary on the table of Croatian Football Federation.  Dalic guided Croatia to the July 15 final of the World cup which France eventually won. But the 51 year old who still has two years left in his contract believes finishing second at the world cup is not a mean feat and should attract better pay than his current £3.8million (about N1.9billion). Labeling himself the second best coach in the world, Dalic believes he is worthy of a bumper new take-home at par with most known high earners in the coaching business. ‘Like it or not, I am the second best coach in the world,’ Dalic told Croatian newspaper Vecernji list. ‘And this figure of £3.8m per year for the second coach in the world is too small! ‘I have two years on my contract left and I can stay with the team for that long, but I said that after the tour of United States [in March] I made the decision to go. ‘I cannot stand that people who kicked the ball twice in their lifetime decide about my destiny on the Croatian bench! I’m independent and unburdened, but I cannot let anyone play with me and have someone try to dismiss me in two months.’ But despite their defeat, the former Al-Ain coach feels his side gave a good account of themselves in Russia – and could have even won the final had luck been on their side. ‘I am sad, and I will be sad for the rest of my life,’ Dalic added. ‘It remains a grievance because Croatia are not world champions, and we should have been the winners because of our quality, the quality of our game. ‘But, dear God did not want us to win it. We did not lose to a better team, France just had more luck. A grief about this shall never pass.’
