Super Eagles World Cup sensation, Ogenekaro Etebo denied writing or signing any petition against Warri Wolves over outstanding monies owed  some players by the club. According to a report, Etebo, Daniel Akpeyi and other ex-Warri Wolves players had written a petition to the Economic and Financial Commission demanding payments of monies owed them  under the leadership of current NFF President  Amaju Pinnick. According to the newly signed Stoke City Striker: “My attention was drawn to a newspaper report that myself and Daniel Akpeyi signed a petition against Warri Wolves. My picture was even used in the story which is totally false and a calculated attempt to drag my name into something I know nothing about. Since I left Warri Wolves, I have never complained about money to anyone, neither did I sign any petition. This story is meant to create distractions and confusion. I don’t want anyone to use my name to create confusion. I want to concentrate on my career.” He affirmed that he had instructed his lawyer to take up the matter by demanding an apology. “The publication has brought tension to the extent that my wife had to call me after buying the paper. The publication is not only untrue, but misleading. I think they just wanted to use my name and Akpeyi to score a point, but it is not fair at all. ” I’m ready for the challenge of playing in the big league in England. My ultimate aim is to lead Stoke City back to the Premiership, but it requires alot of work. I cannot do it alone as I need the support of my teammates which I’m already getting. I know I need to work really hard, I won’t be under pressure because my mate’s would support me.”
