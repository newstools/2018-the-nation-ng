Eagles coach Gernot Rohr and member of the FIFA Study Group for the 2018 World Cup Emmanuel Amuneke will be in Rabat, Morocco, from tomorrow for a CAF World Cup workshop over the weekend. All five African teams at Russia 2018 failed to go past the group stage. Amuneke told SCORENigeria: “I will be attending a conference starting from tomorrow mainly to discuss the five representatives of Africa to the World Cup and the way forward for African football. “I believe there is still room for Africa to hit it big in world football, we just have to get the basics right which is right attitude and mentality to work. The talent is there already and so we can push to the next level.” Eagles coach Rohr is expected to submit his World Cup report in Rabat.
