Music icon, Tony Okoroji’s new recording, ‘Oriaku (New School)’ is finally set for national and international release on radio, TV and across several digital media platforms. TOPS, the 360 Degrees entertainment company run by Chief Tony Okoroji, in a statement signed by Babatunde Odubanwo, announced that all is set for the release of the song and its video. The sweet song ‘Oriaku’ with the thumping bass guitar line, was a key song in Tony Okoroji’s iconic album, “Juliana”, which used to burn up the dance floor across the country. “We have re-oxygenated Oriaku,” said Okoroji, who is currently Chairman of the Board of the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON). “It has a new groove. You need to listen to this beautiful song to appreciate what I am talking about. This is not a re-mix but a completely brand-new recording with new orchestration. Working with TOPS All Stars, my young team of very talented creative artistes, we have kept the essential elements of the great song and brought in a fresh new feel to give what we call ‘Oriaku New School’ a new groove.  I believe that lovers of good music, young and old, will rock to this new sound. The video is also very-very electrifying.” The video shoot of Oriaku New School had the photography directed by the prince of video animation, Ademola Tajudeen popularly called ‘Awoko’. According to Awoko, “we have spared nothing in creating a music video that will stand the test of time wherever in the world it is seen. There is a lot of colours, exceedingly beautiful women and a lot of dance, both traditional and contemporary. If you know Chief Tony Okoroji, then you know that I have worked with a man who does not accept mediocrity. Tony Okoroji only goes for the very best.”
