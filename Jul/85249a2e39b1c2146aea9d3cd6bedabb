U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his meetings with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Helsinki went better than the NATO Summit, but the “fake news” media is not reporting it correctly and instead is going crazy. “While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. “Sadly, it is not being reported that way the fake news is going crazy!’’ Trump said via Twitter. Much of the focus from Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki on Monday has been on statements about Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump said at a joint news conference that he did not see any reason why Russia would be responsible for interfering in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump said Putin told him Russia did not interfere in the U.S. election. The U.S. Intelligence Community released a report in January 2017 in which it concluded that that Russia interfered in the 2016 election. Russian officials, including Putin, have repeatedly denied the allegations, noting that no evidence has been revealed to back up the claims. Also, Russian officials have said the allegations have been made up as an excuse for a candidate’s election loss and to deflect public opinion from actual instances of election fraud, corruption as well as other issues.
