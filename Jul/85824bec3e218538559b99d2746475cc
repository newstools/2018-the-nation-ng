The last days in  the month  June ended on a sad note for many Nigerians not just because of the loss of lives in the Plateau farmers/herders’ clashes, but also the death of three young children who died in painful circumstances within their homes. First was the death of Daniel Oyebanjo III, the 13-month-old son of Nigeria’s famous singer D’bang. The late Daniel whose beautiful pictures graced the internet last month during his one-year birthday was said to have drowned in a pool in the cozy Ikoyi residence of the super star.  A day earlier, Timidi Digba, a leading voice in women and girls’ empowerment announced on Facebook the loss of her two children Itunuoluwa and Oluwadamilare. Both children who are under five years old died in a fire accident in their home in Akure, Ondo state. Both cases generated hot debates in the online space, with many questioning the circumstances surrounding the death of those children. Since it’s apparent young children spend up to 90 percent of their time at home; it bears repeating that the home which is supposed to be a safe haven could also be a trap for children to fall into harm.  More than 3 million kids get hurt at home each year, according to Safe Kids Worldwide, an NGO which deals with preventing unintentional injuries.  We compile 10 simple steps to keep babies safe at home:   Car crashes are a serious threat to a child’s safety, so it’s important that babies in a vehicle must be secured in a car seat.  This is an age when children are more likely to get burns and scalds and even drown.
