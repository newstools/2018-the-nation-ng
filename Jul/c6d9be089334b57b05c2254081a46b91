Two weeks after the West African Examinations Council (WAEC) released results of the West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) for school candidates, SS3 pupils of Lagos State public schools have been unable to access their results. Mrs Kehinde Obasola, whose ward attends State Senior High School, Agege, said she was unable to access the result on WAEC’s website (www.waecdirect.org). “When I checked online, I saw ‘not yet released’ after typing in my niece’s details.  She told me they said the result would be released next month,” Mrs Obasola said. A source from the Lagos State Ministry of Education who does not want to be named because of lack of authority to speak on the matter said the non-release of the result may not be unconnected to the non-completion of the payment of the examination fees by the Lagos State government. The Lagos State government pays the WASSCE fees for SS3 pupils of its public schools “Some public school students have not seen their results because the process to pay the money was incomplete. But they are working on it,” the source said. Phone calls and text messages to the Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Education, Mrs Bunmi Adekanye were not returned before production time last night. However, the Head of Public Affairs, WAEC, Mr Demianus Ojijeogu, said the result had been released. “It has been released.  the result is online already. You can quote me,” he said in a phone chat.
