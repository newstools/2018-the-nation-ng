The Federal Government is to evolve a world-class transport system that will position the seaports as a hub in West and Central Africa. Speaking after the Intermodal Freight Transport Conference hosted by The Nation in Abuja, Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) Managing Director Ms Hadiza Bala Usman said the government would establish a safe, efficient, affordable and seamless intermodal transport system in line with global best practices. She canvassed an enabling environment for Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The promotion of inter-modalism, she said, envisaged, among others, the connection of all state capitals, seaports, airports and river ports with railway lines to complement the road infrastructure across the country. According to her, the NPA supports the hosting of the conference and other initiatives as a reflection of the Federal Government’s efforts and determination to showcase the programmes and projects being undertaken by President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration. The maritime sector, Ms Usman said, remains a key sector of the economy, adding that its enormous potential deserves continuous harnessing to meet the government’s expectations and that of the people. “Over the last two years, NPA has been carrying out a number of reform measures aimed at enhancing the operational efficiency in the various ports. For instance, we have identified some issues and challenges that are necessitating intermodal freight transport, which include the following: Other issues and challenges are: Some of the notable benefits associated with inter modal freight transport as identified by Ms Usman include seamless door-to-door transport; possibility of transporting goods more economically in containers that can be moved on land by rail or truck and on water by ship or barge; the movement of bulk commodities in inter modal freight transport and the enhancement of efficiency and integration within the supply chain, which can be transformed into improvements in cost, quality of service and delivery times.
