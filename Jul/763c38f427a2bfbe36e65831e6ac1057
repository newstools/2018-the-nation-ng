Policemen from the Divisional Police headquarters at Apata in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, have arrested seven boys at Dogo in Ido Local Government Area for allegedly stealing 47 bags of cement from a truck. The suspects reportedly stole the cement on Wednesday night when they were contracted to evacuate the product from the truck, which veered off the road and tumbled. The truck had the accident during a downpour at 11 p.m on Wednesday, prompting the driver to beg the boys to assist him evacuate the bags of cement to prevent the product from being damaged by the rain. The boys reportedly agreed to assist the driver but insisted that they should be paid, a demand the driver agreed to. To have a record for the money he would pay to the boys, the driver reportedly asked them to write down their names in a sheet of paper, which he said would be presented as evidence for the payment when he gets back to the company. The boys put down their names and immediately offloaded the bags of cement, after which they were paid N30,000 by the driver. But when the truck was pulled back on its track on Thursday morning and the bags of cements were to be loaded again, the driver discovered that 47 bags were missing. He report the matter to the police at the Apata Divisional Police Station, and the police asked him if he had the identities of the boys who helped him to evacuate the bags of cement the previous night. The truck driver handed over the list in which the boys wrote their names to the police, leading to the arrest of the boys. A police source who confirmed the incident to our correspondent, said the boys would be charged to court.
