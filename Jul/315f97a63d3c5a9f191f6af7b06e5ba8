Veteran Yoruba actress, Ayandotun Emmanuel, who is popularly known as Ayoka Ologede has said that her tribal marks did not stand as a barrier in her acting career. She revealed this in a chat with The Nation. “I didn’t feel threatened by my tribal marks; in fact, people loved me for them,” she said. “I was very comfortable with them and they became like a signature for me.” The actress also said times have changed in terms of promotion of movies. “Back in the days when I was with Late Herbert Ogunde, when we wanted to promote a movie, we will move round towns in the different states in big bushes where you will see us dancing to the rhythm coming from drums. It was fun back then. “But all has changed now and everything has gone digital”. The actress comes from a background where drummers make a living through dance and stage plays, which led to her choice after elementary school.
