The Minister of Youths and Sports, Solomon Dalung said on Friday he would prefer to keep his reputation intact in the crisis bedeviling the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). The minister said he complied with the Supreme Court judgment in the matter in order not be jailed for contempt of court. Dalung spoke in Asaba, Asaba, while inspecting the ongoing construction work at the Stephen Keshi Stadium venue of the 2018 African Senior Athletics Championship (ASAC). The minister said Chris Giwa and Amaju Pinnick tussle for the top NFF post had rocked the peace in the sports community. There is resurgence of crisis in the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) in recent time and I think it is important that Nigerians are informed about this crisis,” he said. Dalung said he believed both parties have learnt the hard way from the recent Supreme Court judgment, adding that the way forward was for the feuding parties to shift ground and allow peace rein. He said the Federal Government did not interfere in the dispute but was dragged into it by the feuding parties. He said: “For us as government, we have basically just complied with the order of court and let us not forget that government is limited from interfering with the domestic affairs of football. And both parties dragged government into this matter, so, government is just a victim and not even when people argued that FIFA will ban the country.”
