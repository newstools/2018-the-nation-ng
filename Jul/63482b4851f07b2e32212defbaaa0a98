As a strategy of boosting its customer satisfaction drive, LASACO Assurance Plc has unveiled a speedy and more responsive claim settlement solution that would make policyholders get compensation under their motor insurance policies faster. It has also launched an instant rescue solution which provides free towing service for vehicles with severe damage particularly for vehicles owners insured by LASACO and generally for motorists operating within major parts Lagos State. The claim settlement solution, tagged LASACO Blue Response, which is targeted at automobile insurance operations, would enable the company solve the most critical aspect of claim assessment and settle minor automobile insurance claims immediately upon notification. The solution, first in the industry in Nigeria, would reduce the time frame between accident and claim settlement and encourage more interaction between insurance operators and their clients. Covering minor accidents, the solution would only be available to policyholders in Lagos (excluding Epe, Imota and Badagry for now) who, in the event of an accident, would be required to call the company on 07000LASACO (07000527226) and their trained claim assessor would reach the location of accident within 30 minutes.
