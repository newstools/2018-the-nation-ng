Alhaji Alani Adeniyi Alao, the father of Adeyemi Alao, the key suspect in the murder of Khadijat Oluboyo, daughter of immediate past Ondo State Deputy Governor Lasisi Oluboyo, said he handed over his son to the police. Alao said he handed the suspect over to the police when his other children reported the shock find of the victim’s body in his son’s room to him. But he declined to speak further on the matter. The mother of the 27-year-old suspect and three others living in the same compound, where the body was discovered, have gone into hiding for fear of possible arrest, it was gathered. One of the neighbours said Adeyemi lived with some tenants in the boys’ quarters of his father’s house where the body of the girl was discovered in a grave inside his room. Adeyemi, the first son of the family, had just returned from Abuja where he observed his national youth service before carrying out the suspected killing of his girlfriend, a final year student of the Adekunle Ajasin Univerity (AAU), Akungba- Akoko, last week. Adeyemi, 27, is described as a quiet young man who always kept to himself and seldom greeted people. The neighbour, who spoke in confidence, added: “Khadijat’s ghost appeared to Mutiu, who is Adeyemi’s brother. “It was Mutiu who reported to his father and the father told him to rush to the ‘B’ Division Police Station before Adeyemi was arrested.” Adeyemi was said to have dug a grave in his room where he buried Khadijah for six days before he was arrested.
