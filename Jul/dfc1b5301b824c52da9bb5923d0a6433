Republic of Benin boxer, Franc Houanvoegbe, has vowed to make his opponent, Nigeria’s Akeem “Dodo” Sadiku, suffer when they meet in an international light middleweight challenge bout at GOtv Boxing Night on July 29. The bout is one of the two international contests scheduled to take place on the night at the Indoor Sports Hall of the Obafemi Awolowo (formerly Liberty) Stadium in Ibadan. Houanvoegbe said his low boxing profile will be an advantage, as Dodo would not know what to expect. He also disclosed that he is involved in intensive training for the bout and intends to severely punish Dodo. “Dodo is not likely to have heard of me. I like it that way. I’m coming to surprise him. He will receive the type of punishment he has never imagined possible. It will be war,” Houanvoegbe said. In the other international bout, the biggest on the night, reigning African Boxing Union, ABU, lightweight champion, Nigeria’s Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph will defend his title against Ghanaian challenger, Nathaniel Nukpe. Other bouts of the scheduled seven at GOtv Boxing night include a national cruiserweight clash between Michael “Lion Heart” Godwin and Idowu “ID Cabasa” Okusote, and a national light heavyweight contest between Daniel “Big Shark” Emeka and Sulaimon “Olags” Adeosun.
