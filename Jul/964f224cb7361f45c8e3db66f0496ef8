The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has commiserated with victims of last Thursday’s tanker explosion on Otedola Bridge of the Lagos/Ibadan Expressway. The party regretted that the tragedy occurred when the state government was working hard to ensure accident-free transportation system, which Lagos residents had commended. Lagos APC Chairman, Alhaji Tunde Balogun, prayed for the repose of the souls of the departed and wished those injured quick recovery. He said: “It is unfortunate. It is unnecessary. We did not bargain for this in Lagos. It is bad. It is sad. Efforts should be made that this type of tragedy does not occur again in Lagos.” He advised tanker operators and drivers to ensure that their long vehicles are fit for the road, adding that safe driving practices could avert doom on busy roads. Balogun said: “Our thoughts go out to the victims and their families at this trying period. We pray for the repose of the souls of the departed and quick recovery for hospitalised victims who sustained injuries.
