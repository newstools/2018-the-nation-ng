Apapa-Iganmu Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chairman Alhaja Funmilayo Akande-Muhammed has presented General Certificate of Education (GCE) forms to 55 pupils. The gesture, she said, was part of activities to mark her 365 days in office. She also presented official cars to the councillors. Alhaja Akande-Muhammed promised to give free Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) forms and monetary incentive to pupils to encourage them further their education. “Last year, over 100 pupils benefited from the gesture. It is also a way of fulfilling my electoral promises. We have recorded success within a short period in the areas of education, health, infrastructural development and poverty alleviation, among others. We also organised an awareness programme to sensitise our youths against cultism. Recently, we organised Spelling Bee Competition for primary school pupils,” she said.
