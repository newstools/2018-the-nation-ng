At least two hangers-on have been confirmed dead and one other injured after a train averted a collusion with an abandoned commercial bus. The incident occurred Friday morning at Pen Cinema, Agege, Lagos. It was gathered that the three victims were sitting atop the train when it veered upon sighting the bus from afar. Witnesses said one of the victims fell on the rail line and was shredded by the moving train, while the other two injured lost some body parts and were taken to a hospital, where one of them later died. The train was said to have continued its journey, oblivious of the casualties. Irked by the incident, hoodlums, it was gathered, set the bus ablaze as onlookers rushed the injured to nearby Orile-Agege General Hospital. Confirming the incident, the General Manager, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA), Adesina Tiamiyu, who was at the scene, said the wreckage of the bus had been removed. He said: “It is true there was an accident there, but untrue that many people died. The bus was empty and packed on the side. “The three victims were hanging on top of the train. One of them died, while the other two sustained injuries. They were taken to a nearby hospital but we are going there now to see them, assess their condition and relocate them if necessary. “We have appealed to residents so many times to stop hanging on moving objects. Sitting on top of a moving train is dangerous. It is deadly. People should value their lives.”
