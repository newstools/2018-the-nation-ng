Super Eagles’ and new Brighton and Hove Albion defender, Leon Balogun has said he is at home following the reception he got on his arrival at the team’s training camp in the United Kingdom (UK), adding that he is eager to get to work ahead of the new season, AOIFootball.com reports. The former Mainz O5 player, who was given an extended break due to Nigeria’s participation at the just concluded FIFA World Cup in Russia, told the club’s website that he hopes to adapt quickly and contribute his quota to the team’s development. “It’s my first day and I’ve just finished. I was really warmly received and it’s a nice group. My first impressions were very positive, and I feel very comfortable within the group – they all made me feel welcome. “The league starts very soon and between now and then it’s about getting up to speed with everyone else as soon as possible. Then I want to take it from there, but I’ll give everything I can to improve what this group already has and play the biggest role that I can for the team,” Balogun noted.
