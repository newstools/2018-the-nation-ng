The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Benue State has welcomed Governor Samuel Ortom following his defection from the All Progressives Congress (APC). A statement by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Comrade Bemgba Iortyom, noted Ortom is a former state and national official of the PDP, having served as state secretary, state deputy chairman and national auditor. Bemgba said: “Ortom’s return to the PDP is a home-coming, one which has increased the party’s membership strength. And in line with our objective to maintain continual membership growth, this is a welcome development. “We assure the governor that he is guaranteed rights and privileges entitled him in the constitution, same as there are obligations prescribed to him therein.” The publicity secretary said defections into the PDP was a reflection of the party’s quality as the most attractive and viable political platform ahead of 2019; a platform offering Nigerians the best guarantee for a return to good governance and true democracy. Some PDP governorship aspirants addressed a news conference in Abuja to reject his return to the party. But Ortom, through his media aide, Tahav Agerzua, said he did not need to consult them before returning to the party.
