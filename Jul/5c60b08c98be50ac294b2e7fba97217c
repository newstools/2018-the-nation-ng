The Kickboxing Federation of Nigeria (KBFN) has commended the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development for its positive response to its plea to include the sport in the 19th National Sports Festival (NSF). Wilson Okon, a board member of KBFN, on Wednesday in Lagos said that the sport had been officially approved as a scoring event in the festival. Okon said the sport was not earlier shortlisted for the NSF, which prompted various plea to the ministry that led to its consideration and endorsement among others. “We are very happy with the Solomon Dalung-led sports ministry because for him to consider our sport which was not on the event’s list shows that he has a listening ear. “Stakeholders are really impressed with this positive development and the joy of it is that the response came promptly, as we will join in the preparations for the festival,” he said. Okon, who doubles as a certified referee of the World Association of Kickboxing Organisation (WAKO), said the event in the NSF would enhance its development. He said the sport was not featured in “KO 2012” NSF hosted by Lagos State, adding that the absence created a vacuum which the forthcoming festival would be used to restore. ‘`We have missed out and our kickboxers have lost chances of exhibiting their skill as a result of our absence in previous festival`s which we need to cover,” he added. The KBFN official noted that measures would be put in place as part of build up through seminars to update coaches, referees and kickboxers on its discipline and ethics. The sports ministry will host the 19th NSF in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja, in December and it will feature 20 compulsory and five optional sports. NAN
