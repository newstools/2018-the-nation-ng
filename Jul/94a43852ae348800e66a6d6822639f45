So, it was crazy to see them watch our team compete in the World Cup without making any noise or lighting up Budweiser’s Red Light Cup,” said, Kanu while presenting the World Cup tickets. He continued, “I had such a great time partnering with Budweiser, a brand I enjoy, ‘Don’t Light It Up.’ Getting to go to the World Cup is special and it means so much to these lucky fans to win a trip from Budweiser. I could see it on their faces. I could see how happy they are, and to be able to see the World Cup live, that’s awesome!”
