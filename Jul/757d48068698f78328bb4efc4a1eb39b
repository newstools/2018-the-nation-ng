The Federal High Court in Abuja has set aside sections 96 and 97 of the Kano State Revenue Administration (Amendment) Law, No. 3 of 2017, which empowers the state to collect consumption tax. The Nigeria Employers Consultative Association (NECA) and Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited, operators of Shoprite, sued the Attorney-General of the Federation, Kano Attorney-General and Kano State Inland Revenue Service. They urged the court to hold that state law was in conflict with the provisions of the Value Added Tax (VAT) Act, Cap VI, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004. According to them, the VAT Act is already being implemented by the Federal Government as a consumption tax for the benefit of both the federal and states governments. The plaintiffs prayed the court to determine whether Sections 96 and 97 of the Kano State Revenue Administration (Amendment) Law, No. 3 of 2017, did not amount to double and multiple taxation. In his verdict, Justice John Tsoho resolved the three issues raised by the plaintiffs for determination in their favour. He held that sections 96 and 97 of the Kano State Revenue Administration (Amendment) Law, No. 3 of 2017 are inconsistent with items 7 and 8 of Part II of the Second Schedule to the Constitution. According to him, the imposition of consumption tax through Sections 96 and 97 of the Kano State Law over the same goods and services which are already subject to VAT amounted to double taxation. The court dismissed the defendantsâ€™ preliminary objection to the suit.
