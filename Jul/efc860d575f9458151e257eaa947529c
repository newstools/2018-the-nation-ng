MARIFA Whyte, several years ago, held sway on the social scene. Beautiful and of mixed race, she runs Savers Q discount card, a premier lifestyle discount card, and later kidsâ€™ funspot, Tickle bay. Well, she went into a relationship with wealthy businessman, Mohammed Asibelua, and husband of Abuja-based business woman behind Momo Couture, Fati. Their relationship eventually produced a child. Unfortunately, their whirlwind romance soon became shaky when Fati Asibelua finally welcomed a pair of twins, after 14 years of waiting and three years after Marifa welcomed a baby boy. Marifa has since given socials a wide berth. Although rumours have it that she has found love in the arms of another person who shuttles between Nigeria and Canada.
