Two of the political parties announced as part of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP-led coalition against President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday denied involvement. The Peoples Democratic Movement (PDM) and the Alliance for Democracy (AD) in separate statements, said they remained independent. PDM National Chairman Bashir Yusuf Ibrahim, said: “the PDM is not part of any coalition of political parties or part of any arrangement to work with a group of political parties for the purpose of 2019 general elections. PDM has never attended any meeting at which such a coalition was discussed, let alone be part of it.” Flaunting its aims and objectives, which he claimed was not in agreement with other parties mentioned in the coalition, Ibrahim described the PDM as a party of hnonorable people whose single objective may not be to capture power for its own sake. National Publicity Secretary of the AD, Ms Nola Olayinka, said: “The attention of the Alliance for Democracy has been drawn to a purported MoU signed by some political parties in Abuja today in which our great party, the AD, was mentioned as being part of. “We strongly deny any pact with either the PDP or the R-APC or any other political party and we consider it very preposterous for our party to be associated with the pact. “We are using this medium to inform the  public, all party faithful and the INEC that at no time were we part of the talk and negotiations. We advise that the information should be ignored as a mere ploy to add credence to their MoU with the use of the name of our great party.”
