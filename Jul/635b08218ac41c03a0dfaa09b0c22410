A fake medical doctor, Salisu Usman, yesterday confessed at an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court in Lagos that he had been treating patients, posing as a qualified medical doctor. “I am as guilty as charged,” Usman, 28, told court. Consequently, Magistrate Mrs B.O. Osunsanmi ordered his remand at the Kirikiri Prisons until July 20 for a review of facts and sentencing. The defendant, who pleaded for mercy, lives at Oluwalogbo, Isefun community in Ayobo, Lagos outskirts. Prosecuting Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Ezekiel Ayorinde, said Usman committed the offence on July 6 at Baden Junction in Ayobo. He said Usman was found with a bag containing medical and surgical facilities without being a qualified medical practitioner. “The defendant, who parades himself as a medical doctor, treats, dispenses, supplies, administers and sells poisonous and dangerous drugs to patients. “He was found with different types of tablets, syringes, needles, injections and other medical items. “But when he was asked to present his certificate or identity card, he could not. “He confessed that he was not a genuine doctor and he was therefore, taken to the police station,”Ayorinde said.
