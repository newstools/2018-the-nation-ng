Entries have been invited for the fifth edition of the prestigious Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation open to Engineers from Nigeria and other sub-Saharan countries. Monday 23 July 2018 is the deadline for the entries. Last year, a Nigerian systems engineer Godwin Benson won the prestigious Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation with his education app, Tuteria The Africa Prize, founded by the UK’s Royal Academy of Engineering, is a six-month training programme which helps engineers become entrepreneurs through funding, bespoke mentoring and comprehensive business training. Judges have provided more than 1,200 hours of support to candidates since the prize was established – valued at more than £630,000 (roughly NGN 300 million). “The skills you get from the Africa Prize last a lifetime and help you reshape and rethink your business,” said inaugural Africa Prize winner, Dr Askwar Hilonga. Hilonga’s NanoFilter business has expanded across Tanzania, with support from international NGOs and organisations, making a lasting impact on people in the region by providing innovative water filtration systems to communities. The 16 candidates shortlisted for the Prize will receive training to develop business plans and market their innovations. The group is coached on structuring their business plans, communicating effectively, focusing on customers and approaching investors with confidence. Training includes two on-site week-long sessions, and regular coaching during the six-month period. Previous Nigerian shortlisted candidates include:
• Ayodele Adigun with a mobile application for merchants and customers to make and receive card payments through their phones and tablets
• Captain Abubakar Imam with a removable burglar-bar system for emergency exits from buildings
• Emeka Nwachinemere with Kitovu, an online platform that helps farmers in remote locations to increase crop yields and sell their produce
• Ifediora Emmanuel Ugochukwu with iMeter, which gives electricity consumers and power utilities more control over electricity use
• Justin Nwaogwugwu with an affordable multi-purpose degreaser/cleaner
• Nnaemeka Chidiebere Ikegwuono with ColdHubs, solar-powered walk-in cold rooms that extend the life of perishable food tenfold
• Olufemi Odeleye with Tryctor, an affordable, multifunctional tractor that’s easy to maintain for small-scale farmers Engineers from all disciplines are invited to submit innovations with a social, economic or environmental benefit. Entries must be early-stage innovations which have the potential to be scaled-up and are ready for commercialisation. The Prize selects a shortlist of innovators from across the continent. It is the biggest prize dedicated to engineering innovation, and provides a unique package of support, including funding, comprehensive business training, and bespoke mentoring. Candidates also get access to the Royal Academy of Engineering’s network of high profile, experienced engineers and experts, and their networks. After six months of training, selected finalists present their innovation to judges and a live audience, before a winner is awarded £25,000. Runners up receive £10,000. “Engineering drives development and social change and has the potential to significantly improve quality of life,” said Africa Prize judge, Rebecca Enonchong from Cameroon. “African engineers are already advancing technology in fields ranging from health and agriculture to education and energy. Developing entrepreneurial skills among those innovative engineers is the key to showcasing and amplifying the continent’s considerable technological strength.” The fourth winner of the Africa Prize was announced in Nairobi, Kenya on 13 June 2018. Ugandan software engineer Brian Gitta won the award with his innovation, Matibabu, a device which test for malaria without drawing blood. Previous winners of the Africa Prize for Engineering Innovation are Tanzanian Dr Askwar Hilonga, creator of the NanoFilter; Cardiopad founder Arthur Zang from Cameroon; and Godwin Benson from Nigeria for the education app, Tuteria.
