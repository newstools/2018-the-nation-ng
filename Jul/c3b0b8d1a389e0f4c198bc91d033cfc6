The Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole, has assured residents of Osun State the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the September 22 governorship election, Alhaji Gboyega Oyetola, will consolidate on the legacies of outgoing Governor Rauf Aregbesola. Adewole spoke during a visit to the Ilerioluwa office of the Gboyega Oyetola Campaign Organisation in Osogbo, the capital. He said: “Over time, I have convinced myself that we need someone who can build on the infrastructure Aregbesola has put in place, someone who can continue with good speed and in the right direction. I’m happy the larger percentage of APC members found you worthy. I have no doubt in my mind that you will perform excellently well on assumption of office, by the special grace of God.” On the outcome of the party’s primary, he said: “In this contest, there’s no winner, there’s no vanquished. I am happy you have kick-started the process of reconciliation, which is a good attribute of sportsmanship. “The presence of other aspirants, like Dr. Ismail Saka-Layonu and Chief Olugboyega Alabi, in your office today is a testament to your humility. We must all work together to win the coming election.” Pledging his loyalty to the party and its candidate, the minister said he would support the project. He said: “While I will use this medium to thank Mr. Governor, our party chairman and the leaders of the party across the state for the steadfastness in steering the ship of the state, I charge us all to deliver Osun not only to ourselves but deliver it in September 2018 and in the 2019 general elections.”
