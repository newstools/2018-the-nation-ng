A major industrial crisis is brewing at the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) following the management’s rejection of the  union election. It called for its cancellation and a fresh election. The management, it was gathered, was transferring the newly elected union officials and other vocal union members out of the headquarters in contravention of labour laws. The management, in a letter addressed to the FCT Council of the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporations, Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPCTRE), signed by the Director, Human Resource Management, Usman Abdulkadir, said the conduct of the union election violated the rules for the conduct of such an election. The letter dated  June 14, this year said the management was rejecting the outcome of the election because it violates the rules of displaying posters and fliers and the nomination of a candidate on the floor of the election, after the closure of nomination among other actions by the contestants. Responding, the union’s General Secretary, Yusuf Lekke Zambuk told the management that since union election was not within the purview of management, the union was not obliged to honour its request, pointing out that the election was legally conducted.
