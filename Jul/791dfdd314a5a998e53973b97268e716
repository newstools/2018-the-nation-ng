Delta Governor Dr Ifeanyi Okowa yesterday, performed the symbolic hoisting of flags of participating nations in the African Athletics Championships, at the Stephen Keshi Stadium, Asaba. Governor Okowa said months of strenuous effort to make the stadium ready for the event had paid off, as everything which will make the championship hitch-free, has been put in place. He said, “This championship means a lot to the people of Asaba of Delta State, Nigeria, but, particularly, to us as a government, Asaba is agog as we look forward to hosting a successful championship”. He also stated that, “in the last several months, we have been on our toes, working to make the stadium ready, we thank God that we are ready and I want to commend members of the local organising committee for their commitment to seeing that everything is in place for the championship. It is a thing of joy that most of our guests have already arrived and by Wednesday, August 1, the championship will commence. We are committed to sports development in the state, we hope to channel the energy of our youths to sports and utilise the facilities that we have”. Chairman, LOC CAA 2018, Solomon Ogba disclosed that of the 54 African countries billed to participate in the championship, 52 have already arrived in Nigeria. Ogba stated that the hoisting of the flags signaled, “the commencement of the championship, visitors will enjoy the events and it is worthy to note that championships are hosted by cities, not countries that is why we have Asaba 2018.” Chairman, Delta State Sports Commission, Tonobok Okowa observed that the hoisting of flags of participating countries was a mark of respect for those countries. Okowa inspected a guard of honour mounted by the Police at the event. Okowa later undertook an inspection of the stadium and the ongoing rehabilitation of the Jesus Saves Road and the Direct Labour Road which would serve as access roads during the championship.
