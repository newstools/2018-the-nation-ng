Kwara State High Court in Ilorin has asked Dr Stephen Olajide to stop parading himself as the Ollola of Olla in Isin Local Government Area. The Aro of Olla, Chief Adebayo Adeniyi and three other claimants, on July 18 2017, approached the court seeking an order setting aside the nomination, appointment, installation and coronation of Olajide as the Ollola of Olla while the case subsists in court. Olajide and six others are defendants in the case. In his ruling, Justice M. AbdulGafar, said: “I have considered the application of the claimants, the affidavit evidence of the claimants, the affidavit of the fifth to sixth defendant, Dr Olajide, as well as the submission of the parties. “It is clear that the seventh defendant (Dr Olajide) was appointed during the pendency of this case. The Governor and Attorney-General/Commissioner of Justice (5th-6th) defendants, installed Dr Olajide while this case was pending before this court. “This court has an inherent jurisdiction to set aside any steps taken by the parties in defiance of court orders. I hereby nullify and set aside the nomination, appointment and installation of the seventh defendant as the Ollola of Olla.” Justice AbdulGafar thereafter adjourned the case till July 10 for mention.
