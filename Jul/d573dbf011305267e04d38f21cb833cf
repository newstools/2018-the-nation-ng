A self styled travel agent, Dele Oguntona, 54, was yesterday hauled before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for “obtaining N1.2million under false pretences.” The accused was arraigned before Magistrate O.J. Awope on a two-count charge of obtaining money under false pretences and stealing. Oguntona, who lives in Surulere, Lagos, pleaded not guilty. He was granted N500,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. Awope said the sureties must show evidence of two years’ tax payment to the Lagos State Government. Prosecuting Inspector Emmanuel Ajayi said the accused committed the offences sometime in March 2015 in Mushin, Lagos State. He said the accused obtained N1.2 million from Mr Timothy Oladimeji on the pretext of being a travel agent and could assist him in securing a travel visa to the United States (US). “The accused approached the complainant claiming he was a travel agent when he heard that he needed an agent to help him process a US visa. “After collecting the money from the complainant, he absconded to an unknown destination. “Efforts made by the complainant to get the visa or retrieve his money from the accused proved unsuccessful as the accused refused to pick calls from the complainant’s cell phone. “After three years of searching for the accused, the complainant got information about his whereabouts in Aguda near Surulere. “He went to the house with the police and the accused was arrested,” the prosecutor said. The case continues on September 29.
