 D’Tigers Head Coach, Alex Nwora has said that the preparation for the second and final round of the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers has already started. Nwora stated this after his side became the first team in Africa to qualify for the final round of the qualifiers with their emphatic 109 points to 66 win against Uganda at the National Stadium in Lagos. The first leg of the second round tournament will take place during the fourth window in September from 10th to 18th while the return leg is between 26th of November and 4th of December. Nwora stressed that the fourth window which will likely throw up tougher opponents will be well prepared for. “From our next game, we will start preparing for September. If we are going to face countries like Senegal, Cote d’Ivoire, Mozambique and Central Africa Republic who are also big names in African basketball, then we need to step up our game.” Having recorded 3 wins in the second window of the qualifiers, all Nigeria needed was just a point to seal their place as one of the 3 teams in Group B to advance to the next round. With qualification already secured, Nwora said focus will now shift to young debutants in the team in its quest to give them more playing time. “We have secured our win and we are so excited about this. We have a mixture of experienced and young but new players in this team. We will give the younger players more time on the court to see what they can do. I am really excited about the endless possibilities of the team going by their potentials”. The world cup which is the flagship edition made up of 32 teams will take place in China from 31st August to 15th September, 2019.
