The police in Rivers State yesterday paraded 11 suspected criminals for their alleged involvement in crimes. They are held for kidnapping,  robbery and car-snatching. Police Commissioner Zaki Ahmed said in a statement in Port Harcourt the suspects were arrested by men of the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (F-SARS). He said the arrests were made last month, adding the suspects will be arraigned after investigation. Fifteen cars, 11 guns, 40 machetes, dagger and four axes were recovered from them. The command displayed weapons, including machetes,  guns, axes and dagger reportedly surrendered by repentant cultists, who gave their lives to Jesus Christ at Salvation Ministry Church, Port Harcourt. Ahmed hailed the church for converting sinners, saying the act was in line with the directive of the Inspector-General of Police to mop-up arms. He pledged the commitment of the police to protect life and property.
