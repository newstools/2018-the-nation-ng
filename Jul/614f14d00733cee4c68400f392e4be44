Rohr also told NationSport  that the five teams namely Nigeria, Senegal, Tunisia, Morocco and Egypt which represented Africa also lost out to ill-luck and bad organisation. The Coach who however hailed the performances of the African teams in their respective groups in the ongoing World Cup in Russia. He believed that with continuity and better luck in 2022 World Cup in Qatar an African country may qualify to the semifinals of the next World Cup. Rohr was proud of African teams losing narrowly and gallantly to world football powers like the Super Eagles fighting hard against Argentina, while Senegal failed to qualify to the second round due to card offences. “Generally they are missing a better continuity, especially in technical staff”, Rohr disclosed to NationSport while in Saint Petersburg “African teams missed luck and still have some problems with organisation. But I forsee a situation in the next World Cup in Qatar that an African team may qualify to the semifinals of the competition. All the problems I itemizes here prevented an African team sailing through to the second round of the ongoing World Cup in Russia”, Rohr disclosed to NationSport cum SportingLife in Saint Petersburg.
