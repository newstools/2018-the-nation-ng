•Increase sales by 125% For every unit of purchase being made at the Nigerian stock market by foreign investors, they are selling two units as political risks and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to reduce investors’ appetite for Nigerian equities. Trading data on domestic and foreign portfolio investments (FPI) at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) showed that foreign investors’ outflows from the equities market increased by 124.7 per cent to about N131 billion in May as against N58.25 billion in April. However, there was a 3.45 per cent decrease in foreign inflows to N62.06 billion in May as against N64.28 billion recorded in April. The FPI report used two key indicators-inflow and outflow, to gauge foreign investors’ mood and participation in the stock market as a barometer for the economy. Foreign portfolio investment outflow includes sales transactions or liquidation of equity portfolio investments through the stock market while inflow includes purchase transactions on the NSE. The NSE report is generally regarded as a credible gauge of foreign portfolio investments in Nigeria as it coordinates data from nearly all active investment bankers and stockbrokers.
