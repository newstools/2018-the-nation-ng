Former Deputy Senate Leader, Jonathan Zwingina, on Wednesday called for establishment of state police, saying it is the ultimate solution to the nation’s security challenges. Zwingina made the call when he visited the Paramount Ruler of Ganye Chiefdom in Adamawa, Alhaji Umar Sanda. According to him,  state police will not undermine the authority of the federal police but complement it. He said the police to citizens’ ratio was about one police man to 1,000 people, instead of the global standard of one to four. The former deputy senate leader also said half of the police personnel were attached to very important personalities, thus limiting efficient security coverage. He said some of the security challenges facing the country were due to neglect of traditional institutions. NAN
