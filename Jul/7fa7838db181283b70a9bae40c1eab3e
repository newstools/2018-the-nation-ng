Multiple award-winning singer, Simi, is all set for an evening of fun and music, as she thrills her fan in Abuja this Saturday. In the event tagged, Johnnie, Jazz & Whisky (JJW), Simi said she is ready to storm the stage and give her fans more than her best, just as she longs to perform on the same stage with notable Afrojazz musician, Lagbaja at the event. “As an artist I appreciate my flavor of music and there are other flavours that have stuck with me through time, like what Lagbaja for instance brings to hearts and minds of many; It’s often edgy and smooth at the same time.  I have always wondered what my creamy and tropical flavor would be like if it mixed with Lagbaja’s Smoky feel…. I think you and I can find that out at the JJW in Abuja.” Talking about the show, the X3M music act said, “Music and I are one and the same; we are pretty much inseparable – Its gentle rhythm and pulsating notes; I’m simply lost without music. All music lovers have different flavours, but I would describe my blend of musical flavour as Creamy and Tropical; it just can’t help but take you places in your head.” JJW is Nigeria’s premier afro-jazz platform showcasing the true beauty of a live performance. Each JJW night is best described as ‘A blend of music & flavours’.
