The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State has denied allegations of vote buying leveled against it by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and its candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola. The party said it was in possession of documentary and electronic evidences to prove that Governor Ayo Fayose, Olusola and PDP purchased to influence the outcome of last Saturday’s governorship election. The election was won by the APC candidate, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, who has since been declared governor-elect by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The APC in a statement issued on Tuesday by its Publicity Secretary, Taiwo Olatunbosun, condemned the practice of vote-buying, saying such practice should be discouraged to allow democracy grow. The party also urged media houses to be fair in hearing all parties involved in the election, saying that selective treatment of issues is a denial of fair hearing for correct public judgment. The party praised people of the state for voting the party’s candidate, saying the gesture would ginger Fayemi to continue with programmes aimed at lifting Ekiti people out of poverty.
