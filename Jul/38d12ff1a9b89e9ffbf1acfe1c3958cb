The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Israel Assembly, Lagos Province 2, has spent over N3 million to  pave the premises of Alausa Police Station in Ikeja, with interlocking stones. Pastor in Charge of the Province, Pastor Yemi Lebi, represented by Pastor Tope Abenu, said it was good to have a chance to make the environment more conducive for policing work. “We do not take you for granted and we thank you for receiving us well. RCCG is a church that has a vision to give back to the society. The church is into corporate social responsibility (CSR), to help the society; we go into the society to make a difference. “We go to markets, communities, prisons, hospitals and we are in a police station.  We go with things to make life better for others and to give hope. We also go to schools and give scholarships to indigent pupils, among other things. We also feed the hungry and we teach people how to make a living. When people have what to do to make a living, criminality will reduce. We rehabilitate drug addicts to reduce the job of the police,” he said. The Acting Area Commander, Area F Ikeja, John Ajigidi thanked the church for the gesture. “I am surprised and happy. The gesture is going to be of immense contribution, because other people, churches and non-governmental organisations will now see the police as their friend,” Ajigidi said. He urged his colleagues to use their discretion in carrying out their activities. “You should not collect illegal money from anyone; you should sometimes let them go on warning. Why do you arrest Okada riders and collect money from them.  I know there is a ban on Okada on major roads and streets, but not all of them commit the offence purposely.  When you tell them to pay N10,000, it is not fair. In the police, discretion is allowed; there are some certain things you can overlook. Some people carry expired papers unknowingly, you can sometimes warn them and let them go,” he said.
