SuperSport analyst Dwight Yorke, who has been sharing his opinion on DStv and GOtv during the World Cup, has put his neck on the line by predicting victory for France in Sunday’s final. The former Trinidad and Tobago captain will be on duty for the Russia 2018 showpiece match, with the build-up live on DStv and GOtv from 2 pm, along with Andy Townsend and Austin “Jay-Jay” Okocha. Yorke believes that the French have enough quality to overcome Croatia and win a second world title. “On paper, they are favourites and rightly so with the number of potential match-winners in their squad when compared to their opponents. Pogba, Mbappe, Griezmann and Kante all have the ability to turn the game on its head in an instant and it’s the quality possessed by these players that will see them win,” he said. On their unconvincing run to the final, he said: “It’s the World Cup final and it doesn’t really matter how you get there so long as you get there. They never really hit top gear in the group stages where they always squeaked through by the odd goal, but one always felt that they were just one gear away from overrunning their opponents,” he explained. He, however, cautioned against writing off Croatia on the assumption that they’ll be weary after having played three matches that went into extra time.
