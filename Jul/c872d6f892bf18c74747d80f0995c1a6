An Anglican priest, Reverend Dr Maxwell Ogazi has raised alarm over incessant sale of babies across the country under the guise of adoption. He stressed that babies should not be sold to foster parents but should be given out free of charge for adoption. The warning is coming on the heels of incessant cases of disappearance of babies in the state as well as proliferation of illegal orphanages through modern slavery. Speaking yesterday at the event to mark his 50th year anniversary with children at his Christian Compassionate Community Children’s home, Obosi in Idemmili North Council Area of the State, Ogazi insisted that orphanages should be purely on charitable ground and must be duly registered with government. “Those engaging in illegal adoption without the knowledge of Child Development Department of the State Ministry of Women and
Children Affairs must desist from such acts as it negates the laws of
the state,” he stated. The clergyman who underscored the cost implications of running such homes, called for
government’s support towards offsetting the education and health bills of the children. According to Ogazi, the orphanage was duly registered and equipped with modern facilities for the comfort and care of children, just as he enjoined parents to bring their children to the home for free care especially during the holiday period. He listed some of the challenges of the home to include functional vehicle, generating sets, food materials, children’s beds, baby walkers and toys as well as routine drugs.
