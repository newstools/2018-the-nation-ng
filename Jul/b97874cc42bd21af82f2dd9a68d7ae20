The United States has agreed to work towards lowering trade barriers with the European Union, Donald Trump said on Wednesday after a meeting with European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker. The two agreed to launch a “new phase” in relations and work towards zero tariffs, the U.S president said. The BBC reports they also agreed to increase trade in services and agriculture, including greater U.S soy bean exports to the EU. The agreements come amid heightened tensions between the U.S and EU. The two leaders defused what had threatened to become a trade war between the two blocs, fuelled by tariffs set by Mr. Trump on European steel and aluminium exports, and threats to expand the tariffs to cars. The relationship between the U.S and Europe had been further frayed by Mr. Trump’s apparent fondness for the Russian President Vladimir Putin and attacks on NATO and the EU.
