A Federal High Court in Abuja has granted bail to former National Security Adviser (NSA), Col. Mohammed Sambo Dasuki (rtd). Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu in a judgment on Monday said Dasuki’s continued detention by the state, without sufficient reasons, violated his right to liberty. The judgement was on a fundamental rights enforcement application by Dasuki, who has been in the custody of the Department of State Security (DSS) since December 29, 2015. Justice Ojukwu granted Dasuki bail at N200million with two sureties, who must be either a civil servant of Grade Level 16 in the Federal Civil Service or a private citizens, with landed properties in the municipal areas of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The judge faulted the reasons given by the Federal Government for detaining Dasuki. She said the state’s argument that the applicant was being held because of threat to national security and that he was being investigated for money laundering offences do not allow the violation of his right. Justice Ojukwu rejected Dasuki’s prayer for N5billion damages, but said should there be need for him to be further interrogated; the DSS should only invite and question him between the hours of 9am and 6pm on work days.
