A PRESIDENTIAL aspirant, Mr. Gbenga Olawepo-Hashim, has promised to end killings, if elected as President. Olawepo-Hashim, who is seeking the ticket of the Alliance for New Nigeria (ANN), spoke at the Middle Belt Conference organised by the Middle Belt Forum (MBF) in Makurdi, Benue State Capital, on Monday. Condemning the killings, especially in the middle belt, he said the All Progressives Congress (APC) lacks the political will to stop the killings. He said: “The Middle Belt is the land of the people that were neither conquered nor enslaved. “It is too late in the day for Nigeria’s democracy to be subjugated. I want to assure you that like my brothers have said, this is not a personal ambition, it is a struggle to save Nigeria from imminent fascism.” He assured Nigerians that his government would fix the nation’s economy, create enabling environment for business to flourish and create jobs for the benefit of all and sundry. Another presidential aspirant, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher said many Nigerians from the region “are eminently qualified to become the next president of this country”. Former Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Deputy Governor Obadiah Mailafia, said: “We are all going to work together because we are brothers and sisters, the race is not about me, it is not a must, it is about our people, their long suffering and the destiny of this nation. What kind of leadership do we want? What kind of transformation do we want? “My vision is of a country that will be competing with Germany not South Africa or Brazil. A very advanced technological society based on the rule of law, based on democracy and socio justice.”
