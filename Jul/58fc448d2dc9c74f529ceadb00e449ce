Music producer, Chris Alvin Sunday, aka Krizbeatz, has revealed that hip hop act Jahbless spurred him on to believe in himself. He disclosed this in a chat with The Nation. Having worked with Drake, Omarion, Wizkid, Tekno, Davido and a host of other acts, Krizbeatz produced the beat of the song ‘Pana’ by Teckno which instantly became a hit song. Relating his journey to stardom, the talented producer said Jahbless told him he would become a notable music producer. “While I was in school, Jahbless flew from America to Ibadan,” Krizbeatz said. “It was a big thing for me then as the news circulated on the campus. He told me that my sound would take over the world someday. Working with Jahbless made me start believing in myself. While Jahbless gave me the belief, producing Tekno’s Pana in 2016 changed everything for me”. Krizbeatz also said there is the need for organisers of award ceremonies to do more research before nominations. “For organisers of award ceremonies, I feel that there is need to do more research before nominations. But if an artiste misses out on an award, it means the person needs to work harder.
