United States President, Donald Trump, is set to meet other NATO leaders for potentially fractious talks at a summit in Brussels shortly. Ahead of his visit, Mr. Trump hit out at the European Union on trade and at his NATO allies for failing to spend enough on defence, the BBC reports. He was met with a sharp rebuke from European Council President, Donald Tusk, who accused the U.S President of criticising Europe “almost daily.” “Dear America, appreciate your allies, after all you don’t have that many.” Mr. Tusk added that the EU spent more than Russia on defence, and as much as China. He said the U.S did not and would not have a better ally than the EU, reminding the President that European troops had also fought and died in Afghanistan after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the US. For his part, President Trump predicted that the NATO meeting could be harder than his summit with the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, in Finland next Monday.
