The Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) has given the sixth IAAF silver label Okpekpe International 10km Road Race held last May in Okpekpe, a clean bill of health following the negative dope tests recorded at the one-day meeting. Disclosing this in Lagos on Wednesday, the race’s spokesman, Dare Esan, revealed that the result of the doping control carried out on race day (May 12) has returned an all negative result. In an e-mail message to the promoter of the race Mike Itemuagbor, the AIU, which sits at the heart of the IAAF’s integrity reforms confirmed that none of the samples taken at the event tested positive for the use of performance-enhancing drugs. ”I am pleased to inform you that the analyses of the doping control samples collected at Okpekpe Intl 10km Road Race, performed at the WADA-accredited laboratory in Stockholm, did not reveal the presence or use of a substance or method prohibited under the current WADA Prohibited List, ‘wrote Virginie Ocquidant, the AIU In Competition Testing Coordinator.
