 Flying Eagles of Nigeria will Thursday leave the shores of the country for Mauritania for the first leg, third round of a two legged CAF U20 Nations Cup qualifiers. The Paul Aigbogun tutored side will be hoping to post an impressive run in the first leg in Nouakchott before hosting the Mauritanians in the second leg billed for July 19. The second leg of the clash baring last minute change of plans  is likely to be  played at the U.J Usuene Stadium which some have described as a base of luck for the Flying Eagles. To advance to the 3rd round of the championship, the Flying Eagles edged out Guinea Bissau 1-0 in the second leg of their tie at the UJ Esuene Stadium to advance 3-2 on aggregate. The team had in the first leg held Guinea Bissau to a 2-2 draw in Bissau. Adamu AlHassan and Calentine Ozornwarfo among others who were impressive in ties against Guinea Bissau will be hoping to replicate the feat when they file out against Mauritania on Friday. Aigbogun who doubles as Coach of CAF Confederation cup Campaigners Enyimba, stand a good chance of leading the Flying Eagles to greater heights especially when he is backed by tested assistants in Abdul Maikaba and Bala Abubakar. While the Flying Eagles will be sweating it out against Mauritania, in Nouakchott on Friday, Ghana will take on Benin Republic in Accra, Burkina Faso host Gabon, Zambia take on Burundi, South Africa battle Malawi, Congo slug it out with Senegal while Cameroon take on  Mali. The Nation  understands that Head of Technical Department of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Bitrus Bewarang led a delegation of Chris Giwa group to the Flying Eagles Hotel on Wednesday where they were assured of maximum support by the Glass House and were charged to give the battle of Nouakchott coming match maximum concentration.
