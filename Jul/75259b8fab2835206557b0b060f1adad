Ekiti governorship poll recorded a success rate of 90 percent, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has stated. The Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Prof. Abdulganih Olayinka, disclosed this to newsmen in Ado-Ekiti while assessing the electoral process. He said that reports from the eight INEC Commissioners in the field indicated that the election was largely peaceful across the state. Olayinka said he was glad to hear that all INEC personnel, including ad hoc staff, got to their various polling units in good time and the election started early and uniformly. “Except for Agboyin Local Government Area where it was alleged that ballot materials were scattered on the ground and in one or two places where the card reader malfunctioned, all was well,” he said. The REC added that identified problems in the electoral process had been addressed, adding that no “incident form” was used in the exercise.
