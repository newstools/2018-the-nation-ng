A member of the Board of Trustees  and National Vice-Chairman (South West) Contact and Mobilisation Committee of the Buhari Campaign Organisation (BCO), Dr. Fola Akinosun, has congratulated Dr. John Kayode Fayemi on his victory at the governorship election in Ekiti State. In a statement in Ibadan, Oyo State capital, Akinosun described Fayemi’s victory as a watershed and the fulfilment of the wish of the people of Ekiti State. He said: “I am particularly happy that our wish and prayers of BOC was answered. It is indeed a good omen towards 2019 when President Buhari will go to the polls again. “From now on, the good people of Ekiti State will heave a  sigh of relief from the misrule of the POP government of that state and begin to witness  massive transformation in the  social and economic lives of the people.” Akinosun commended the people for putting a decisive end to the era of executive brigandage in the state  and advised them to embrace the incoming administration of Fayemi, who will usher in a new era of civility and decorum in governance.
