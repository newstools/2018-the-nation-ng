A businessman, Evans Ukanna, who allegedly forged a Canadian visa after obtaining N8 million from a potential traveller, was yesterday arraigned before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court in Lagos. Ukanna, 30, was charged with a four-count of conspiracy, fraud, forgery and stealing before Chief Magistrate O. O. Oshin. Prosecuting counsel, Mr Daniel Apochi, said Ukanna committed the offences between last October and November in Lagos. The lawyer said the defendant obtained N8 million from Mr Innocent Egbo, under the pretext of securing a Canadian visa and a travel ticket for him. The court heard that Ukanna told Egbo that he had connections at the Canadian Embasy and that he could help him secure a visa. “When the defendant could not secure the visa, he forged a Canadian visa and issued it to the complainant so that it could be acted upon as genuine to the prejudice of the complainant,” Apochi said. According to him, the offences contravened sections 285, 312, 363 and 409 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2011. But Ukanna pleaded not guilty. His counsel, Mr E. E. Eze, applied for his bail. Chief Magistrate Oshin upheld his application and granted him bail for N500,000 with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on August 7.
