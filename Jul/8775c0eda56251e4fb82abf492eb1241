As part of measures to sanitise the chaotic traffic situation in Lagos especially in the Apapa axis caused by indiscriminate parking of trailers and tankers, Lagos State Government has suspended further approval of tank farms. The government gave owners of tank farms 30 days to have adequate holding bay, or face sanction. This was part of the resolutions of a meeting between representatives of the Federal and Lagos State governments and stakeholders in the maritime industry. The meeting was held at the State House, Alausa, Ikeja, yesterday. Others in attendance are Nigeria Port Authority (NPA), Shippers Council, tank farm owners, Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and security personnel. The federal government delegation was led by NPA Managing Director Hajiya Hadiza Bala Usman while Governor Akinwunmi Ambode led the state team that include Commissioner of Transport Ladi Lawanson and Secretary to the State Government, Mr Tunji Bello. Lawanson, who read out the resolutions, said a security task force has been constituted by the government to work continuously for 30 days to bring sanity to the roads. Other resolutions include: that the sanctions on shipping companies for non-compliance on utilisation of holding bay have been extended by five days and will be reviewed thereafter. “Federal ministry of Power, Works and Housing is to commence palliative measures on bad portion of access roads” and “trailers not called upon and found trampling will be  sanctioned. “Lagos is to accelerate completion of Orile Trailer Park; all truck and tanker owners must be duly registered and well regulated by their unions and unions will be accountable for their adherence to extant rules and regulations. “NPA in collaboration with Lagos will license trailer parks whereby only trucks housed in those designated parks will be granted access.”
