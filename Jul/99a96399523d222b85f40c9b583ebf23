Some parts of Lagos may be without water as the State Water Corporation (LSWC) embarks on a four-days repair of its major pipes, its Groups Managing Director (GMD) Muminu Badmus, said yesterday. The repair, which started on Saturday on pipes on Carter Bridge-Iddo axis, would end on Wednesday, Badmus said. He said: “The water leakage at Carter Bridge is 600mm diameter pipe between Oyingbo and Iddo Motorway would be affected. This will lead to disruption in water supply to major parts of Lagos metropolis. “The parts of Lagos that will experience disruption in water supply during the repair are: Lagos Island, Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Surulere, Yaba and Ebute Metta. “We are soliciting for the cooperation of the general public during the repair as we are working to ensure steady water supply in the state and to serve you better,” he said. Badmus said the corporation embarked on the repair before the closure of the Third Mainland Bridge for repair to avert traffic gridlock. “The repairs on the pipes are necessary at this period to ease traffic movement in the area before the closure of the Third mainland Bridge on July 27,” he said.
