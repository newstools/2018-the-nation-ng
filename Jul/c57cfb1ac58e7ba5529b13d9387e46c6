Andrej Kramaric comes into the side to replace Marcelo Brozovic. There’s one change to the Russia side which overcame Spain in the last 16 as Denis Cheryshev starts and Yuri Zhrkov misses out with a calf injury.  HOW DID WE GET HERE? Russia have defied all sorts of expectations on their march to the last eight. Comprehensive wins over Saudi Arabia and Egypt were followed by a 3-0 defeat to Uruguay which set up a last-16 clash with much-fancied Spain. After a 1-1 draw, the hosts triumphed on penalties to cause a huge shock. Croatia won all of their group games against Nigeria (2-0), Argentina (3-0) and Iceland (2-1) to reach the last 16 where they came from behind to draw 1-1 with Denmark. Despite Luka Modric’s failure from the spot in extra-time, they won the shootout to set up this evening’s Sochi showdown.
