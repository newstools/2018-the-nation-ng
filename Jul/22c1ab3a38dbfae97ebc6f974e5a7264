A Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain in Lagos State, Fatima Mohammed, had joined the House of Representatives race in Ifako-Ijaye Constituency. She boasted that she will get the ticket at the primary and beat the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate at the poll because she is popular. Mohammed said she commanded respect among the PDP and APC members in the local government, adding that her philanthropist activities have made her a community woman. The aspirant, who spoke with our correspondent in Ikeja, said the personalities of candidates, and not their parties, will determine the outcome of the federal legislative election in the constituency. She described Ifako-Ijaye Constituency as a politically conscious area where constituents have sharpened their skills for electing candidates based on merit and competence. Mohammed said when an unpopular candidate is fielded by parties, voters would respond with apathy by shunning the polling booths in protest. The aspirant predicted success for herself at the PDP primary, adding that she will give the APC candidate a run for his/her money. She said she had rejected the overtures to return to the progressive bloc in Lagos since she defected from the fold in 2007, following the failure of Mr. Jimi Agbaje to pick the Alliance for Democracy (AD) governorship ticket. Mohammed hailed the womenfolk in Ifako/Ijaye, who she described as her permanent fans, adding that they would prefer her to other candidates in next year’s poll. She said: “I am waiting for the race to commence. I am joining the race for the House of Representatives in  Ifako/Ijaye. Certain circumstances aborted my desire to represent the constituency in the past. But, for 2019, the foast is clear for me. People are waiting for me. I will get the PDP ticket and defeat the APC candidate. I have the support base. I have the people behind me. 2019 is my year of going to the House of Representatives.”
