The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) on Thursday appealed to the Federal Government to find lasting solution to the persistent farmers and herders crisis. The association’s spokesman, Mr Bestman Okereafor, made the appeal in Enugu. He said that the consistent farmers and herdsmen crisis had claimed lives and rendered many Nigerians homeless. “NANS is suggesting to the Federal Government to regulate the activities of the herdsmen across the federation by considering ranching that is in the long run for Nigerian herdsmen,’’ Okereafor said in statement. He, however, cautioned a former Minister of Science and Technology, retired Maj.-Gen. Sam Momah, who was currently quoted as allegedly saying “Nigeria may cease to be as a country in the next 12 years if nothing was done to restructure it.’’ “NANS considers this speech made by Maj.-Gen. Momah as an unwarranted one, and one capable of causing unnecessary tension in the country at this time when the country is undergoing some security challenges. “Rather, we expect him as a former minister of the country to spread and preach the gospel of peace as 2019 General Elections beckons,’’ Okereafor said.
