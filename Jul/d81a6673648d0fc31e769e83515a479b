•Demands respect for INEC timetable All campaigns for the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari by his supporters across the country must be suspended for now, according to a directive to such support groups yesterday by the Presidency. The seat of power said the campaign guidelines issued by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) must be respected by all. The President’s Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, noted “what may be interpreted as political campaigns” by some Buhari supporters and said while the presidency appreciated such enthusiasm, patience was necessary “so that the game can be played according to the rules.” He said:”The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has a timetable for political campaigns, and we urge committed supporters round the country (and beyond) to be mindful of such. “While a chronicle of the achievements of the administration is in order now, outright canvassing may amount to jumping the gun. “We are an administration committed to due process and scrupulous respect for rules, law and order. “We appreciate our massive supporters nationwide, and urge them to exercise restraint till the race commences officially as stipulated by law.”
