A woman, Joy Godwin, was yesterday brought before a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court for allegedly paying for N306,000 worth of designer items via fake funds transfer. Godwin, 26, was arraigned by the police on a two-count charge of fraud and theft before Mrs F. M. Dalley. Prosecuting Sergeant Oluwafemi Adeleye alleged that Godwin committed the offences on July 13 at about 2:30pm at Ajah, Lagos. The court heard that the defendant bought clothes, shoes and bags worth N306,000 from Dress Jem Boutique and requested to pay by money transfer. She was given a Point of Sale (POS) machine and it indicated that the transfer was successful, following which she left with the goods. However, it was later discovered that no money was remitted into the boutique’s bank account. Adeleye said: “The sales girl called the number the defendant gave the boutique several times, but it was unavailable. “On July 17, the defendant returned to the boutique, disguised with a hijab and sun glasses. She bought five tops, one trousers and two pairs of shoes and again asked to use the POS machine. “Her request made the sales girl suspicious and she asked to see the defendant’s face, but she refused. The sales girl raised the alarm and, when the defendant’s sunglasses and face veil were removed, it was discovered that she was the same person.” Godwin pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Dalley granted her N100,000 bail with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on August 14.
