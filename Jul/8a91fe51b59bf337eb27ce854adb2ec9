The Delta State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said its quest to take over of the reins of governance in next year’s general election is non-negotiable. Its chairman, Chief Cyril Ogodo, spoke at the party’s maiden expanded State Executive Committee (SEC) meeting at APC secretariat in Asaba, the state capital. The chairman hailed party leaders and other faithful for standing firm during the challenges over its congresses. He said though there was a faction that conducted parallel congresses and claimed legitimacy through “a contentious court consent judgment”, the duly elected executive council, which was not party to nor consented to such judgment, could not be bound by it. Ogodo said what was uppermost for the party was how to dislodge the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) administration from the state in next year’s general elections. The chairman said the party’s State Executive Council (ESC) was poised to reconcile aggrieved members. “Delta State must be rescued in 2019. This is not negotiable,” he said. Also, the state’s party leader, Olorogun O’tega Emerhor, congratulated Ogodo and other executive members for their successes at the congresses and swearing-in. The party leader noted that APC’s new National Chairman, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole, was misled by the Great Ogboru/Ovie Omo-Agege group to approve their alleged fraudulent consent judgment. He said: “Comrade Oshiomhole is a man of truth and integrity. Having now found out the truth about the fraudulent consent judgment, he will never support it.” Ogodo said the national chairman, as well as the Presidency, had mandated the Minister of State for Petroleum, Dr Ibe Kachikwu, to reconcile all party groups for unity and peace.
