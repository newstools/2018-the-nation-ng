The Special Adviser to the President of the Senate on Media and Publicity, Mr. Yusuph Olaniyonu said the invasion of the residence of Dr. Bukola Saraki was to prevent defection of some members of the National Assembly from the All Progressives Congress( APC) to the Peoples Democratic Party( PDP) today. Olaniyonu said: “Entry to Saraki’s house blocked by police. Ekweremadu’s house surrounded by SSS. The plan is to prevent Senate from sitting and therefore abort plan for mass defection. “By their calculation, as many days as they delay the defection, so they can scare many of the proposed defectors and whittle down their numbers. “Also, they believe many of the would be defectors will back down in the face of this intimidation.“
