BILLIONAIRE businessman and Africa’s richest man, Aliko Dangote, is craving for a desire despite being very successful in his business dealings. The Kano State-born billionaire is shopping for a wife to spend the rest of his life with. 61 years old, Dangote is blessed with looks and a fat wallet, although he is twice divorced with three children.  His first wife was selected for him in 1977; that was when he was 20 years old. He later got married to Mariya A D Muhammad Rufai, who he later divorced too. Dangote fell in love with Nafisat Yar’Adua, the young daughter of the late President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua. She, however, refused to marry him because she and his daughter were friends.
