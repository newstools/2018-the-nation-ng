Unknown armed bandits along Kaduna- Abuja highway on Sunday night shot and killed a former commissioner for education in Katsina state, Prof Halimatu Sa’adiyya Idris. A press release which was obtained from the Public Relations Officer of the state Ministry of Education, Salisu Lawal Kerau, which confirmed the development on Monday, said she and other road users were attacked near Bussa village, between Jere and Kateri communities. Prof Idris, 60, was made commissioner in November, 2015, during the early months of Governor Aminu Bello Masari’s tenure. During her time in office, she received the Kwame Nkrumah exemplary leadership award of excellence in recognition for her outstanding contribution to the development of education in the state and country. She was however fired on December 27, 2017 purportedly over her statement which she called for state teachers to undergo an aptitude test. It was learnt she had wanted to sanitise the education system by ensuring that only qualified teachers, with requisite English and related skills, taught in public schools. Her statement at the time had raised much dust with many calling for her ousting. Before her death, she had worked as principal of GGSS, Malumfashi, 1987-1989, GGSS, Sandamu, 1990-1991, and was lecturer at the College of Advanced Studies, Zaria, from 1893-1987. She was also Education Officer, ministry of education, Katsina, from 1989-1990,. Dean, faculty of science, Umaru Musa Yar’Adua university, Katsina, in 2015. Both statements said burial rites held on Monday afternoon in Unguwar Sarki, Kaduna state. In a condolence message, Senator Abu Ibrahim (APC, Katsina South), expressed sadness over the demise of the late professor. Ibrahim called on her family members and people of Faskari council area where she hailed from, to take heart. He prayed God to grant her eternal rest and the family members, the fortitude to bear the loss.
