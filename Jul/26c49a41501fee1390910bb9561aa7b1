The Bauchi state government has hailed last Friday’s Supreme Court judgment which upheld the 2014 nomination of Mohammade Abubakar as the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate for the Bauchi State governorship election. The apex court set aside the Court of Appeal judgment and uoheld the trial court judgment in the matter to lay to rest the matter against Abubakar, who won the election sna currently serving as governor. A suit filed by one Comrade Abdullahi Mohammed Tanko (Orlando) secured a favorable judgement at the Appeal Court sitting in Jos challenging the December 2014 APC primary election that returned MA Abubakar as the APC standard beare. The Respondent had earlier lost his case in the trial court and thereafter rushed to the Appeal Court to upturn the verdict of the court. The Appellant (MA Abubakar) however,  appealed to the Supreme Court faulting the entire judgement of the Appeal Court.. Delivering his judgement on Friday, Justice Sidi Bage, set aside the judgement of the Court of Appeal saying Abubakar was duly nominated.
