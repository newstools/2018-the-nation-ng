Early results from Pakistan’s election suggest ex-cricket star, Imran Khan, is on course to become the country’s prime minister. With nearly half the votes counted from Wednesday’s election, Mr. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party is in the lead, the BBC reports. It is expected to fall short of an overall majority and to seek coalition partners. Officials denied claims of vote rigging made by Mr. Khan’s rivals. Campaigning has been marred by violence. On voting day a bomb killed 31 people at a polling station. With votes counted in 47 per cent of stations, Mr. Khan’s PTI was leading in 113 of the 272 National Assembly constituencies being contested, Pakistan’s Dawn Newspaper reported, citing Election Commission figures. Oxford-educated Mr. Khan, who led Pakistan to victory in cricket’s World Cup in 1992, first entered politics in 1996 but struggled for years on the political sidelines. In the lead-up to this vote, the 65-year-old faced accusations that he was benefiting from military interference against his rivals. This election will mark only the second time that a civilian government has handed power to another after serving a full term in Pakistan.
