The Ekiti State Police Command has dismissed insinuations on the social media that its men invaded the Government House on Wednesday. Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mr. Caleb Ikechukwu, urged members of the public to consider the content of the postings as “misleading and aimed at causing anxiety in the minds of the public.” Ikechukwu signed the statement on behalf of the Deputy Inspector General of Police (Election Duty Coordinator), Mr. Habila Joshak. Ikechukwu said: “In furtherance to the presence of police officers around the Prof. Olusola Eleka Pavilion at Fajuyi on Wednesday, two political parties intend to have their rallies at the same date and in Ado-Ekiti metropolis. “But the Commissioner of Police advised the political parties in writing on the need to have their political activities at different time and because of its security implication. “The Police will, at all times, continue to maintain law and order and also rise up to their responsibility to perform their mandatory and statutory duty of protection of lives and property of innocent citizens before, during and after the election. “The Police would also want to use this medium to alert the general public that they should expect more of this misleading information from person(s) who do not mean well to te good people of Ekiti State. “The Police enjoin the general public to confirm the source of their information before circulating same to their friends or loved ones.”
