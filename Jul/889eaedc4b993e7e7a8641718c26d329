The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) and Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) have advised Lagosians to use Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) and waterways transportation during the repair of Third Mainland Bridge. FRSC Lagos State Sector Commander Hyginus Omeje and LASTMA Chief Executive Officer Chris Olakpe said this yesterday in separate interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos. They were reacting to the proposed closure of the bridge for emergency rehabilitation/maintenance. Omeje said the corps would be working with other traffic agencies to ensure free flow of vehicular movement in various routes that will be affected during the bridge repair. “We advise residents in that axis to ensure that they use alternative routes or other means of transportation to avoid traffic jam. Motorists who have nothing to do at the Lagos Island should stay off at this period and people should make use of waterways and BRT that has designated routes. People from Ikorodu going to Apapa should endeavour to use waterways transport system, at least for the main time to avoid delay on the road,” Omeje said. Olakpe said no fewer than 100 LASTMA officials were on ground to ensure sanity on the road during repairs.
