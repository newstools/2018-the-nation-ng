The 1987 set of the department of Mass Communication alumni at the University of Lagos ( UNILAG ) has donated a set of interactive boards to the department. The coordinator of the 87 set, Alh. Tajudeen Adeyemi described the event as a privilege to give back to the department. He said, “The idea of this initiative came about at our second reunion. We thought of doing a tangible project that will be useful to both the staff and students of the department and contacted one of us, Dr. Olubunmi Ajibade, a senior lecturer in the department and he suggested interactive boards.” Adeyemi, who commissioned the facilities was accompanied by the President of Unilag Mass Communication Alumni Association (UMCAA), Mr. Vincent Oyo and members of the 87 set;
Managing Director of Complete Communications, Alh. Mumuni Alao, Mr. Michael Bamigbola and Mr. Taiwo Osunsanya among others. Oyo said the move was a beginning of more support initiatives that would come to the department. He expressed enthusiasm that the interest of the department’s alumni body was to train students to do big things in the future. Uyo noted that the goal of UMCAA was to ensure that the department is transformed to a viable faculty of communication. He added however, that the association has been intensifying its efforts to kick start its “Gown-to-Town” programme which he said, was inspired by the need to intimate students with the best media industry experience. Meanwhile, in her address, the head of department, Prof. Abigail Ogwezzy-Ndisika described the gesture as a direction towards the destination communication is going globally. She expressed joy and gratitude just as she said the facilities would serve as one one the ways through which the staff and students of the department will “reskill and retool.”
