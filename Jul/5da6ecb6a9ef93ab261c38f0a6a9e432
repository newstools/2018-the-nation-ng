Underage commercial bus driver whose identity was still unknown has reportedly sent a corps member and another female victim to their early graves in Aba, the commercial nerve of Abia State. The incident, our reporter gathered happened along Ohanku, off Ngwa road, Aba South Local Government Area of the state. Some respondents who spoke to our reporter over the issue attributed the cause of the death of the male and female road users to over speeding which made the driver to lose control of the vehicle before crashing into the victims. Investigation has it that some conductors and mechanics are in the habit of using vehicles in their custody for commercial purposes without the knowledge of the bus or car owner which they use as an alternative means of income. While a different account has it that the underage driver was handed over to the security agents, another account has it that he fled the scene immediately the incident happened. Bodies of the deceased persons were said to have been deposited in a nearby morgue. “The commercial bus driver was heading to Owerre-Aba when the driver lost control of the car, killing two persons; a young man in youth corps uniform and a woman and later broke into a shop and part of the building it crashed into. People who later came to the scene said that they warned the driver over his recklessness,” a source stated The State Commissioner of Police, CP Anthony Ogbizi and the spokesman of the command Geoffrey Ogbonna were yet to respond to text messages sent to their phones over the incident.
