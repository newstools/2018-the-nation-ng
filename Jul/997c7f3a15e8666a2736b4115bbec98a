Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr has thrown his weight behind recently retired Eagles’ goalkeeper Carl Ikeme to become not only a goalkeeper’s coach but a general coach. The recuperating Eagles’ former number one goalkeeper, a few days ago announced his retirement from active football due to his illness. He was diagnosed by doctors to have leukaemia and just recovered from the sickness. The General Secretary of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) disclosed at a press briefing on Sunday, that the Federation had concluded plans to absorb Ikeme as a coaching staff and by that, to help him train as a coach. Rohr, however, has also confirmed his readiness to help his former number one goal-tender become a complete football coach. “I spoke with Carl about the possibility to become a coach and proposed to help him. Most important is that the sickness is over. He is 30 and can prepare for diplomas in good coaching schools”, Rohr told NationSport from Germany where he is attending an international coaching meeting yesterday. Rohr also explained that “when Carl called me two weeks ago, he was sad. But our proposal to help him become a coach with the Eagles’ team is now giving him new hope. Besides this proposal, he would also learn to become a general coach. A goalkeeper coach has to do a lot of physical efforts such as shooting a lot”, Rohr disclosed.
