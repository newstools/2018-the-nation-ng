Scores of students of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in Ogbomoso, Oyo State, yesterday shut down the institution during their protest against the expulsion and suspension of 12 of their colleagues. The protesters were allegedly supported by members of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS). They blocked the university’s main gate at 6.30 a.m, preventing workers and other students from entering the campus. The protest came at a day examinations were scheduled to start. According to newspeakonline.com, Abdulafeez Adeoti, son of the immediate past Secretary to Osun State Government (SSG), Moshood Adeoti, was among the students expelled for alleged post-students’ union election violence on June 13. The school authorities, after considering the report of a panel of enquiry into the violence, expelled four students and placed eight on suspension. The protesters called for immediate reinstatement of the suspended and expelled students, some of who are in their final year. The Students’ Union President Oluwaseun Laurel had a hard time urging the demonstrators to calm down. Quoting some sources, Newspeakonline said most students did not support of the protest as they claimed that they were not informed. The university’s spokesman could not be reached last night for comment.
