The Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate), Mr. Ita Enang, said on Friday the Federal Government is doing everything within its powers to tackle insecurity in the country. Enang told students of the Nigerian Law School, Abuja, who visited him in his office that government was on top of the situation. Citing the recent mayhem in Plateau State, Enang said “what is happening now is not just ethnic or inter-ethnic conflicts, it is pure terrorism. “This terrorism is not caused within but without.” He decried the actions of the terrorists which he blamed on the policy of the ECOWAS Free Movement Protocol. He noted that the policy allows every person in every country in Africa to have free movement within the continent. Enang said: “They come in with arms. Whenever there is war or the collapse of any nation state, you will have a collateral effect. “We are suffering not from ethnic problems, internal to Nigeria, but from the effects of the collapse of neighbouring countries like Libya and Mali. “Under that protocol, you are to allow them so long as they are Africans. “Our survival, unity and security of citizens are threatened as a country by this free movement and those who come in with evil intention.”
