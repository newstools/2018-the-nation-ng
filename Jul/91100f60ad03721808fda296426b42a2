Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has enjoined intending pilgrims to maintain Lagos State’s clean records in the last five years in Saudi Arabia. He gave this advice at a seminar organised for the intending pilgrims on Saturday at the Old Secretariat, Ikeja. Represented by the Commissioner for Home Affairs and Amirul Hajj, Dr AbdulHakeem AbdulLateef, Ambode said the series of lectures, enlightenment programmes and seminars were meant to shape their attitude and understanding of the pilgrimage. The government, he said, had made adequate provision for their accommodation, feeding, transportation, healthcare and others to make the pilgrimage a success. The state contingent, he said, should do better with the level of training, moral and operational support from the government. The invitation of the representatives of  the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Nigerian Immigration, Service (NOS) National Orientation Agency (NOA) and medical practitioners, he said, was to ensure that the pilgrims were adequately enlightened on the dos and don’ts of the pilgrimage. Lagos State Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board Chairman Dr Tajudeen Yusuf took the intending pilgrims through the Hajj rites.
