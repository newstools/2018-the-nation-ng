Local observers monitoring the Ekiti election have expressed satisfaction in the way the election is going on. They said there was no cause to worry. They said INEC efforts so far were impressive. According to Mr. Dimeji Kayode-Adedeji there was a minor hitch in Are, the town before Afao, where some voters tried to attack some security personnel, who accused them of sharing money to voters. He said his prompt intervention saved the situation. Meanwhile security personnel have been ordering those who have voted to leave the venue immediately. Governor Ayo Fayose is still being expected at his ward 001, St. Davies Primary School, Afao.
