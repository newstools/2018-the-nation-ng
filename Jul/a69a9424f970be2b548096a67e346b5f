Controversial entertainer, Charles Oputa, aka Charly Boy has vowed to defend the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) right in Nigeria, his daughter Dewy being one. With Dewy revealing she is in a lesbian relationship recently, Charly Boy who sometime ago sparked rumour of similar identity, going by a suggestive photoshoot of himself and television show-host, Denrele Edun, announced his readiness to defend the LGBT via an Instagram post on Sunday. Same-sex sexual activity or marriage attracts 14 years imprisonment in Nigeria, but Charly Boy who, from indications is not himself a homosexual says he is ready to wear his activism garment again in defence of the LGBT in Nigeria. He recounted how he had fought for the rights of commercial motorcyclists, popularly called okada riders, as well as musicians during his times as president of Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria (PMAN). “All that I have done for over 50 years of my life is to root for the underdogs… Now I reactivate my fight in defence of the LGBT community,” he said. Dewy who, alongside her girlfriend has opened an Instagram page dedicated to their relationship and supporting the LGBT, had confessed it took a while for her parents to come to terms with her sexual identity.
