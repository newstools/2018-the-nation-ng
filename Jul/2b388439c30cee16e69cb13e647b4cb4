I Gando-Ikotun Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chairman Chief Morenike Adeshina-Wiliams has emphasised the importance of tree planting to living. She spoke at this year’s Tree Planting Day held in Igando, Lagos. She said because trees help to fend off bad winds, it was important that Nigerians planted trees to be safe. Represented by Mopelola, the chairman urged the people embrace the culture of tree planting. Lagos State Commissioner for the Environment Mr Babatunde Durosimi-Etti, represented by the Council Manager Alhaji Olanrewaju Olaleye, also harped on the importance of tree planting. He said the ‘’Plant a Tree Initiative’’ that took place in the state recently was part of government’s plan to replace trees cut down for infrastructural development. He praised Lagosians and organisations for assisting the government in creating awareness on tree planting. ‘’Residents now beautify the frontage of their apartments without being forced to do so… It is gratifying and heartwarming to note that we are all committed to bequeath a better environment for the generation yet unborn,’’ he said. Lagos State Parks and Gardens Agency (LASPARK) General Manager Mrs Bilikiss Adebiyi-Abiola said the government ‘s target to plant 10 million trees by 2020 was on course, adding that so far, it has planted 7,539,221. She warned against tree cutting, adding: ‘’The risks to our health and well-being from removing tree from the environment are far higher. The benefits that urban trees bring cannot be quantified.’’ She added that the state greening programme was being embraced by Anambra, Edo, Ogun and Abia states just as it has received global recognition from the Climate Reality Project, a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) chaired by former United States vice president Al-Gore.
