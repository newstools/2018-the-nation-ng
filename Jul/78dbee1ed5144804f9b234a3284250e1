The Lagos State Government through the Office of the Public Defender (OPD) yesterday began a three-day training for its lawyers on Forensic and Crime Scene Investigation (CSI). The programme is in collaboration with experts from the National Institute for Trial Advocacy (NITA) in Colorado, United States of America. Solicitor-General and Permanent Secretary, Lagos State Ministry of Justice, Mrs. Funlola Odunlami, said 40 lawyers are participating in the programme, which is the second in a series. She added: “In the modern age, science and the law work hand… This means that defence counsel must also have better understanding of the science to provide the best defence possible for clients, thus the need for the training”. Earlier, OPD Director, Mrs. Olayinka Adeyemi, said the Office was proud of the progress it had made in the quality of services rendered to its clients as a result of intensive training of its counsel. Adeyemi added: “As public defenders our practice scope cuts across most areas of legal practice consisting of both criminal and civil litigation serving the indigent and disadvantaged members of the society in ensuring they have a voice. “This requires that our advocacy skills be optimum and these trainings have assisted in honing the skills of each counsel assigned to the OPD.”
