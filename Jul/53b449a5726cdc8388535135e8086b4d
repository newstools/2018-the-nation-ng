FIFA is looking into another video featuring Croatia defender Domagoj Vida and posted on social media, football’s ruling body said on Tuesday. The video once more shows Vida saying “glory to Ukraine” as well as “Belgrade’s burning” with former Croatia player and current staff member Ivica Olic next to him. The news came a day after FIFA fined Croatian team official Ognjen Vukojevic 15,000 Swiss francs (15,000 dollars) for unsporting behaviour, after he posted a video following Croatia’s quarter-final win over Russia in which Vida shouted “glory to Ukraine”. Vukojevic, a former Croatian international, was a team observer and had played with Vida at Dynamo Kiev. Both have apologised, Vida received a warning from FIFA, while Vukojevic was relieved of his duties by the Croatian football federation (HNS) and had his accreditation revoked. The federation apologised to Russia and FIFA for the first video and Vida, who left Kiev in 2017, told Russian portal sports the video had “nothing to do with politics’’ but was a joke for friends. Both videos appeared to have been recorded shortly after Croatia’s win on penalties over Russia in Sochi on Saturday. Report says Croatia meets England in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Moscow. Russia currently faces international sanctions over the country’s role in the Ukraine conflict. The sanctions were first adopted in July 2014 following Russia’s annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. NAN
