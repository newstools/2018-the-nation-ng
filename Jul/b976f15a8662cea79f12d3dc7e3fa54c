K-based Afrobeats artiste, Oluwaseun Emitomo aka Emprince has released a new single titled, ‘Scream My Name’ in which he featured the duo of OritseFemi and Skales. The song was produced by Jay Pizzle Production and mixed/mastered by Indomix. The visual to the song also featured comedian actress, Oyinbo Princess and London based Afro Gram Dancers. Giving hints on his single, EmPrince said: “It’s a story of a lady who fell in love with three different young men. What happens next? Find out in the song titled ‘Scream My Name.’ The melody will capture the heart of all Afro-beats lovers.” Some songs from the soft-spoken singer are ‘Fill up’ and ‘Bend Your Waist.’ The Ondo State protégé drew inspiration from death of his parents which nudged him to pen his inner thoughts about life.
