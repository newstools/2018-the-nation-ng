Senate Deputy Chief Whip Francis Alimikhena, has described members of the Reformed All Progressives Congress (R-APC) as attention seekers. He said the leadership of the party was doing everything to address their grievances Alimekhena (Edo North) assured that many of the aggrieved R-APC members won’t leave the party. Speaking in Bénin City after he was honoured by the Usagbe Social Club of Nigeria, Senator Alimekhena said the APC would not end up like the PDP. Alimekhena said the recent Asset Seizure Executive Order signed by President Mohammadu Buhari was in the right direction. He stated that those kicking against the Executive Order were persons with skeletons in their cupboards. He said: , “In every organisation as big as the APC, there is no way there won’t be friction and disagreements. But I can tell you that the leadership of the party is solving that problem because we don’t want it to end up like the nPDP palaver. “Ours is a small issue. Those agitating are looking for attention and the party is looking into their grievances and very soon they will come back. “Although not everyone of them will stay back, but I can assure you that at least, 90 per cent of them will retrace their steps”.
