Violence has erupted as millions head to the polls in Pakistan, with at least 31 dead in the worst attack, a bomb in the city of Quetta. Elsewhere, minor blasts and clashes between party workers left several injured and two dead, the BBC reports. Voters are deciding between the parties of the former cricket star Imran Khan and the disgraced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif. But the campaign has been overshadowed by concerns of fraud and violence. The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said there have been “blatant” attempts to manipulate the polls. Mr. Khan has vowed to tackle entrenched corruption but his rivals accused him of benefitting from alleged meddling by the powerful military, which has ruled Pakistan for nearly half of its history. Pakistan is no stranger to political turmoil and the last few months have proved no exception. Nawaz Sharif, the man who won the last election, is watching this contest from prison. He has been jailed for corruption after a scandal stemming from the Panama Papers leak.
