You are greeted with a bold print of “Welkorr: Na De Shrine” as you make your way into the main bowel of the magnificent Nigeria Air Force (NAF) Centre, Abuja. A larger than life painted picture of Abami Eda himself adorns the centre to the fascination and admiration of Fala’s apostles. Vehicles of fun lovers spilled over to adjoining roads of Kado area of Abuja due to lack of parking space at the events centre. The hall was full to capacity with Abuja capital city dwellers. It was indeed, a recreation of Fela at its best. As if people starved of fun for a long time, music lovers continued to pour into the event centre hours after the command performance had started. It appeared everybody wanted to catch fun. Nobody wanted to be left out. They were not disappointed at the wrap up of the musical show. The stage was set on June 9th for the highly rated musical fiesta of Fela and the Kalakuta Queens. It was another Bolanle Austen-Peters production (BAP), which communication giant, MTN Foundation, joined other corporate organisations to support. The musical performance chronicles and showcases Fela’s birth, rebirth, activism and marriage to his 27 wives, women who were for all intents and purposes, a source of strength and inspirational support to the Afrobeat creator in the face of constant brutalization, intimidation and even ridicule from the society and government. It is incontrovertible fact that Fela not only used music as a righteous and powerful weapon against corruption and oppression. The Afrobeat creator also became an artistic prophet whose music is still very much significant as most of the messages in his songs are relevant till date. MTN, it was learnt, decided to support the production as part of her continued efforts to promote the advancement of theatre and performing arts in Nigeria. The MTN Foundation Arts and Culture initiative was launched in 2015 with the hope of facilitating the renaissance of the theatre dimension of arts and culture in Nigeria. The production is a huge point of pride for MTN Foundation to have past beneficiaries of the MTNF-MUSON Scholarship programme being integral parts of the musical and other great BAP productions. This further validates the Foundation’s involvement in arts and culture. The MTN Foundation over the years has sponsored other Bolanle Austen-Peters’ award winning theatre plays like ‘Wakaa, the Musical’ and ‘Saro, the musical’ within and beyond the shores of Nigeria. Some of Fela’s great hits featured at the musical included Lady; Water no get enemy; Trouble sleep, yanga go wake am; Beast of no nation; Shakara oloje; Teacher no teach me nonsense, Zombie. The tale about how Nigerians beef up security to protect themselves, buy stand-by generator to give them light, construct borehole to provide water and build clinic for medical services, make them members of the Kalakuta Republic. At the end of the performance, many of those in attendance applauded MTN for organising the events. Like Oliver Twist, they did not fail to ask for more of such star performance in Abuja.
