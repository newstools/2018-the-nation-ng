The House of Representatives on Wednesday urged the Federal Government to fix date for national census scheduled for fourth quarter of 2019. This followed a motion under “Matters of Urgent Public Importance” by Ossy Prestige (Abia-APGA), on the need to conduct census for proper planning and development in Nigeria. Moving the motion, the lawmaker quoted United Nations Fund for Population Activities as saying that Nigeria had a dynamic economy and large population expected to double in the next two decades. He said census was pivotal and necessary tool for the growth of any emerging society, which in turn informed decision-making in public and private sectors. NAN
