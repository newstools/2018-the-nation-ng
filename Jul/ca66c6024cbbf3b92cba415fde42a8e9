Olayinka said the  total valid votes in the election was 384,594 while  total votes cast was 403,451, with 18,857 votes  invalidated. The PDP, however, rejected the results, saying the election was marred by irregularities and attacks of its members and supporters. The party’s agent at the collation centre, Mr Sunday Olowolafe, urged the commission to stay action on the declaration of a winner until a re-run was conducted where there were established cases  of violence, vote-buying and ballot snatching. Fayemi is expected to take over from the incumbent, Mr Ayo Fayose,  on Oct. 16, 2018.
