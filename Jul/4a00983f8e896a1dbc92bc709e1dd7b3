In what promises to be an exciting mix of talent and content, MultiChoice Nigeria recently announced the Super Eagles and Arsenal star, Alex Iwobi, as the latest face of its DStv Compact package. The deal will see the Nigerian superstar feature in DStv’s upcoming campaign for the new football season as well as make special appearances at the brand’s events, amongst other activities. We all know Nigerians love their football and Alex Iwobi’s “signing” with MultiChoice is exciting because he is not only a great footballing talent but the next big thing in African football. And here’s why we think so; He is still young – At age 22, Iwobi still has many footballing years ahead of him. Considering he has acquired valuable Premier League experience from the age of 20, he is well placed to learn from his previous league campaigns and come back stronger for this season. So there you have it! and the new football season kicks-off on Saturday, August 11 with the Premier League followed by La Liga on Saturday, 18 August and Serie A on Sunday, 19 August.
