The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the Ekiti governorship election, Prof. Olusola Eleka, has eventually voted after the card reader to read his PVC twice. He voted at 11.10am after he was manually accredited. There was no assurance that another card reader will be brought by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). No use of incidence form has been filled to that effect. His wife’s PVC could also not be verified by the card reader. It is only the PDP candidate’s PVC that was not read by the card reader in his unit. Everyone else has been verified so far and voting is ongoing Meanwhile, a large turnout of voters still in a long queue in Eleka’s unit. There was a long pause as electoral officers tried unsuccessfully to verify him. Voting resumed after he stepped out of the ward.
