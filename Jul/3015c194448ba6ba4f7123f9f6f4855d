Africa’s sole representative at the ITTF World Tour Platinum tagged Korea Open, Nigeria’s Aruna Quadri has been handed a tough task as he battles giant-killing Chinese star Jingkun Liang in the first round (main draw) of the men’s singles. Quadri, who has been seeded 13 among the 16 seeded players in the men’s singles event, will face the Chinese star who worked his way from the preliminary to the main draw. Quadri hopes to use the tournament to shore up his world ranking as well as shape up for the forthcoming ITTF Challenge Nigeria Open. “I hope I can do well because it is going to be a tough tournament with most of the best players in the world competing for places at the ITTF World Tour Grand Finale holding later in the year. I hope and believe I have a chance like every other player,” Quadri said. Liang is listed 103 on the Men’s World Ranking list. He beat Poland’s Jakub Dyjas, named at no.81 (9-11, 11-4, 11-5, 11-5, 14-12), prior to overcoming Japan’s Masaki Yoshida who stands at no.48 (9-11, 11-6, 11-3, 11-13, 11-2, 11-2).

He was forced to withdraw owing to a back injury. However, the progress of Yan An was abruptly ended in the next round. He was beaten by Korea Republic’s Jeong Sangeun (11-7, 13-11, 11-9, 6-11, 11-8). Similarly, Fang Bo, runner-up at the 2015 World Cham-pionships in Suzhou, departed in the second preliminary round; he was beaten by Frenchman, Can Akkuzu (11-9, 12-10, 6-11, 11-8, 6-11, 13-11).
