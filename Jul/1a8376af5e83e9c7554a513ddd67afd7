 Former Super Eagles forward Osaze Odemwingie says he truly enjoyed the just ended World cup in Russia despite Nigeria’s unimpressive outing. The former Stoke striker, whose 37th birthday coincided with the World cup final between Croatia and eventual winners France on July 15, had earlier described both teams as worthy finalists. Odemwingie who was among ex-internationals that had one opportunity or the other to run analysis on the world cup matches believes that the month long event that put Russia in the front burner  lived up to expectations. The Madura United of Indonesia forward ensured that there was no dull moment for his teeming fans as he updated them regularly on his activities on social media all through the world cup including his live analysis with local and international media. The former Lokomotiv Moscow ace captured it all including meeting with former Chelsea great and Ivorian international Didier Drogba. Odemwingie who last played for the Super Eagles in 2014, made 63 appearances for the national team with 10 goals to his credit. He joined Indonesian side Madura United on 3rd April 2017 and has since made over 22 appearances for the Liga 1 side scoring 15 goals. Other former Nigeria internationals that got world cup analysis roles and made good show of it include former Super Eagles captain Austin Jay Jay Okocha who was recently offered a coaching job by his former club Bolton Wanderers; and former Super Eagles coach Samson Siasia Nigeria’s outing in Russia 2018 many say failed very much below par. The Coach Gernot Rohr tutored side had hit Russia capturing the headlines across the globe after showcasing what was dubbed the most impressive jersey of the tournament. Performance on the pitch however failed to measure up to the popularity level set by the jersey bug.  The team won only a match against Iceland losing both to Croatia and Argentina thus failing to make it to the round of 16 achieved in the 2014 edition in Brazil.
