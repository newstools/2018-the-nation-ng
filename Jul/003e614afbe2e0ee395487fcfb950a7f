Nigeria international Victor Moses was among the Chelsea players missing during the club’s first pre- season training last Saturday ahead of the new English Premier League season. The Chelsea right wing back who has since returned to London has been given some weeks off to rest after representing Nigeria at the FIFA World Cup. Although, it could not be ascertained when Moses who scored Nigeria’s only goal against Argentina would resume, it is however believed it could be before Chelsea face Perth Glory in a friendly on July 23. After the friendly, Chelsea will take part in the International Champions Cup scheduled for end of the month. Some of the players who were present at Saturday’s training were Alvaro Morata, Ross Barkley, Pedro, Marcos Alonso and Danny Drinkwater which was under the supervision of Antonio Conte. Conte is still in charge, but will hand over to Maurizio Sarri next week according to reports.
