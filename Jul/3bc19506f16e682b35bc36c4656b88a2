The Lagos State Government yesterday said there would be traffic diversion and restricted movement from 12 noon to 12 midnight on July 3 around Alausa, the African Shrine and Agidingbi axis in Ikeja. It said the measure became necessary to pave the way for a hitch-free reception for  France President Emmanuel Macron. The Permanent Secretary in the state Ministry of Transportation Taiwo Salaam appealed for the understanding of residents and urged motorists to make use of alternative routes. He said: “While we regret the inconvenience that this might cause the public, especially those who live and work in the area, we appeal that you kindly bear with us during this period and make use of the alternative routes provided.’’ Macron is expected to be hosted by the state government at the African Shrine tomorrow. He would also be attending the opening of the French Cultural Centre and the African Business Forum.
