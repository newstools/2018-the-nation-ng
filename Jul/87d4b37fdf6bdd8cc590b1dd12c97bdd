The Nigeria Medical Association (NMA) in Cross River State has raised an alarm over the increasing number of quack doctors in the state. Chairman of the Association in the state, Dr Effiong Mkpanam, raised the alarm during the 2018 Annual General Meeting/Scientific Conference of the association in Calabar, which had as its theme “Impact of Economic and Security Challenges on Nigeria Health Sector. Mkpanam said that medical quackery in Cross River was assuming an embarrassing dimension, hence the need to curb the menace. He said that the NMA has invested in anti-quackery measures with a view to help fight the menace. The Chairman said that medical doctors now use the ‘Doctors Stamp’ which took effect in 2015 as a way to curb quackery in the health sector. “Quackery in Cross River is assuming another embarrassing dimension. Henceforth, all reports from doctors must carry this customized stamp which carries the doctor’s name, institution attended, the Medical registration and folio number. This stamp has been approved by government and is widely accepted”, he said. He urged Governor Ben Ayade to employ more consultants, nurses and medical officers into the state health sector and also upgrade health facilities across the state. The Keynote Speaker, Prof. Rowland Ndoma-Egba, who spoke on the conference theme, said that the issue of infrastructure in hospitals was relatively low. Ndoma-Egba, a former Chief Medical Director of the University of Calabar Teaching Hospital, said that it was time for government at all level to invest massively in the health sector. The Special Adviser to the Governor on Health Insurance, Mr Godwin Iyala, said that the agency was collaborating with the NMA to deliver quality health service to residents in the state.
