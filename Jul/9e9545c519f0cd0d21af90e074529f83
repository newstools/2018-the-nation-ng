The Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Kpotun-Idris, has described the death of one of his predecessors, Ibrahim Coomassie, as a monumental and irreparable loss to the country. He said the country, Nigeria Police Force and indeed Katsina State where he hailed from, will miss his wise counsel and wealth of experience as a retired experienced Senior Police Officer. Idris described the former IGP as “a godly man, who has the interest of all Nigerians, particularly the police officers at heart above any other thing. He was a bridge builder, an amiable personality who is fond of his people and whose vacuum will be difficult to fill.”
