Former U-17 World Cup-winning captain, Kelechi Nwakali, has declared he is ready to fight and play for both the FC Porto main team and their Team B, admitting he’s happy to have joined a club that can help him continue to improve his game. The 20-year-old attacking midfielder joined the Portuguese giants on loan from Arsenal and will team up with fellow Nigerians Mikel Agu and Yahaya Muhammed ahead of the new season. Nwakali said he was excited about the new challenge, whilst also confirming he will be registered for both the A and B teams. “FC Porto is a very big club and I’m excited to be playing with an outfit that has a big European achievement. I know the challenge ahead and I’m fully ready and committed to making the best of my stay in Portugal. Hopefully, I will get a chance with the main team because I know I have what it takes to play at the very top,” Nwakali noted. Kelechi Nwakali will definitely be on the radar of Coach Gernot Rohr in the nearest future he impressed in May’s friendly against Europa League champions, Athletico Madrid in Uyo.
