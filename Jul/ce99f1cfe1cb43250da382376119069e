Nigeria is lagging behind in filing its reports on Labour practices, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) has stated. ILO said the nation must retrace its steps in line with practices on global Labour standard. But the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) attributed the delay in filing the reports to absence of the Nigeria Labour Advisory Council, which is responsible for advising government on very critical Labour decisions. The body, it said, has been lacking in the country for the past three years. Specialist in Workers Activities ILO office to Nigeria, David Dorkenoo, said when an ILO delegation visited the headquarters of the Nigeria Labour Congress in Abuja that the government was aware of needs to be up to date in its reports. Addressing the deflation, president of the NLC, Comrade Ayuba Wabba, called on government to immediately establish the council saying its absence has hampered the smooth running of Labour issues in the country. The Labour Advisory Council is a statutory organ of government made up of representative of government to Labour and employers expected to work as a tripartite committee to handle Labour issues in the country. Wabba said that the National Labour Advisory Council was necessary to ensure Nigeria drives the process of tripartite consultation on labour matters. According to him, the council has not met for the past three years because it has been non-existent, which is partly responsible for why Nigeria was in arrears of reporting on major conventions at the annual International Labour Conference (ILC) in Geneva Switzerland.
