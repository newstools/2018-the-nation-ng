A gunman has opened fire on a busy avenue in Toronto, killing a young woman and injuring 13 other people, one of them critically. The victim critically injured in the Canadian city’s Greektown district is a girl of eight or nine, police said. The gunman is dead, reportedly killed in an exchange of shots. The BBC reports that the attack erupted on Danforth Avenue on Sunday evening, when the area was teeming with people. The motive for the shooting, which reportedly targeted at least two cafes or restaurants, is still unclear. In a video clip shared by Canadian media, a white man wearing a dark cap and dark clothing and carrying a shoulder bag can be seen stopping on a pavement and pulling out a handgun before firing shots. Some of the victims were treated at the scene, while others were taken to local hospitals. Police are appealing for witnesses. Toronto Mayor John Tory condemned the “despicable” attack on “people innocently enjoying a Sunday evening.”
