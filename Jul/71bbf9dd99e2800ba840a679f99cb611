The Federal Government has been advised to engage traditional rulers and community heads in its effort to address cases of incessant killings in the country. A senior lawyer and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kebbi State, Sahabi Sani Sami said the seeming intractable challenge of herdsmen/farmers clashes could be addressed where the government works with traditional rulers/community heads and identified leaders of the Miyetti Allah group. Sami, who commended the various security  agencies for their efforts, argued that the security problem in the country would  not have got to this alarming state if the National Security Adviser (NSA) was proactive and advised the President appropriately. He said: “If the National Security Adviser had advised the President Appropriately, the security situation in the country would not have degenerated to this level. “He (NSA) needs to be proactive. We feel he is not doing enough. But, it is not for me to decide what should be done to him. The President should take the necessary steps if he discovers that his appointee is not doing well.” Sami was optimistic that the call for the creation of state police would also assist in addressing the security challenge. He however argued that the National Assembly, as currently constituted, is without the requisite integrity and maturity to debate and midwife state police for the country. Sami advocated for proper funding of the various security agencies to enable them do more in the face of increasing security challenge in the country. He praised the Judiciary for its proactive handling of political cases, a practice, which he argued, has assisted in stabilising the nation’s democracy. Sami also hailed the leadership of the Judiciary, particularly the Chief Justice of Nigeria (CJN), Justice Walter Onnoghen for the various innovative reforms he has introduced to the judicial arm of government.
