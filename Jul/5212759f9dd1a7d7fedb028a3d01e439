Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima on Tuesday said that there is cause to celebrate Army Day billed for the state at the weekend. According to him, comparing the security situation in the state four years ago and now makes it necessary to celebrate the victories of the Federal forces against the insurgents. He spoke with State House correspondents at the end of a meeting at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said that the meeting was on the upcoming presidential visit to the state and the Army Day celebration. He said “Well, the ongoing insurgency problem is largely over, we might be having some hiccups but when you compared the past with the present, we have every cause to celebrate. “We have pockets of the insurgents in inlands around the Lake Chad and the Sambisa forest but when you juxtapose the sorry state of affairs three, four years ago and the current situation we are in, I think there is cause for celebration. There is no cause for alarm,” he stated.
