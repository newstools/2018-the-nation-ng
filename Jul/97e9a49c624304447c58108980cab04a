NATO leaders plan to turn their attentions to the conflict in Afghanistan, on the second day of a summit so far dominated by demands from United States President, Donald Trump. Mr. Trump on Wednesday urged NATO allies to commit 4 per cent of their annual output (GDP) to military spending. He also singled out Germany for criticism over its defence spending. The BBC reports that NATO leaders are hoping for a more conciliatory tone on Thursday before Mr. Trump leaves for the United Kingdom. In early-morning tweets from Brussels, the U.S president resumed his criticism. He said: “The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!” European Union figures suggest Russia is responsible for between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of Germany’s gas imports, but gas makes up less than 20 per cent of Germany’s energy mix for power production. Afghanistan’s President, Ashraf Ghani, will be present for the second day of talks, and NATO’s Secretary-General, Jens Stoltenberg, hopes the bloc will agree to fund Afghan security forces until 2024. Britain’s Prime Minister, Theresa May, has already confirmed that the UK will send 440 more troops to serve in non-combat roles in Afghanistan.
