Old students of the Ogun State College of Education (OSCE) Ijebu -Ode, now Tai Solarin University of Education (TASUED, Ijagun, will hold their maiden re-union meeting on Saturday at the Texas Chicken Restaurant, Ijagun, Ijebu Ode for the first time in 30 years. A statement by the Interim President of the group, Chief Sunny Oduntan, noted that the meeting would give the old students the opportunity to interact,  fraternise and dine, adding that it will be an avenue to share all the good old days memories. He said the group would also deliberate on a project to assist its alma mater. “We are all meeting in Ijagun after about 30 years of separation so that we can come together as a team.  Thank God for sparing our lives and for giving us the opportunity to actualise our dreams in those years of youthful exuberance and uncertainty,” he said. Oduntan thanked those who had contributed to the success of the gathering, noting that nothing was too small or big to give back to the school that gave them the needed foundation.
