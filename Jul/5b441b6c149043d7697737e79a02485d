The Chairman of Agege Local Government, Ganiyu Egunjobi, yesterday donated three months’ salary to Bab-Es-Salaam Home, GRA, Ikeja, Lagos to celebrate his 365 days in office and birthday. He said he had never celebrated his birthday until last year, when he was sworn in along with  other chairmen. Egunjobi said there was no difference between him and the common man. He said: “Since I was born, I had never celebrated birthday. But on July 25 last year, Allah made it significant; he designed the day for me. We had election on July 22, and we were supposed to be sworn in on the 24th, which happens to be my vice chairman’s birthday, but it was postponed till July 25, which falls on my birthday. “So this year, I said if I am to celebrate, the best place to come and dance, rejoice and wine is with my brothers and children. I came with public transport; that was the thing I thought I needed to do at that time. I am using this opportunity to implore my colleagues to follow this step. “I am donating a token. I have not collected last month’s salary, but I am donating three months’ salary to the home. Admin take note; don’t write my name on the cheque, but Bab-Es-Salaam Home”. Egunjobi also donated items such as rice, toiletries, noodles, drinks, among other items to the home. Head of Bab-Es-Salaam Home Alhaji Hassan Saheed said the home was founded by the late Alhaji Abdulwahab Iyanda Folawiyo in 1990 to take care of the less privileged orphans from two years old till maturity. There are about 50 orphans at the home, he said.
