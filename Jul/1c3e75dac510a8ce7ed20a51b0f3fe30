United States President, Donald Trump and his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani have traded hostile warnings, amid rising tensions between the two countries. Mr. Trump tweeted Iran would “suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before” if it threatened the U.S. Mr. Rouhani earlier said that war with Iran would be “the mother of all wars.” In May, the U.S left a deal which curbed Iran’s nuclear activities in return for lifting of international sanctions, the BBC reports. Washington is now re-imposing the sanctions, despite objections from the United Kingdom, France, China, Russia and Germany, who all signed the 2015 agreement. President Rouhani’s comments, made to Iranian diplomats, did leave open the possibility of future good relations with the U.S. “America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars,” he said, according to Iran’s state news agency Irna. Mr. Trump’s angry rhetoric has echoes of his Twitter barrages against North Korea’s Kim Jong-un, whom he branded a “madman” who “will be tested like never before,” before engaging in a testy exchange over whose nuclear button was bigger. Their verbal hostilities nonetheless evolved into ongoing diplomatic talks. On Monday, a senior commander in Iran’s Revolutionary Guards suggested the U.S president’s statements were part of a broader strategy. “The remarks Trump makes against Iran are psychological warfare and he would be mistaken should he seek to take action against Iran,” Gholamhossein Gheybparvar said.
