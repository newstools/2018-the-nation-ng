Belgium have beaten Brazil 2-1 in Kazan to qualify for the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup home, sending the five-time World champions home. The Samba Boys  had conceded just one goal in their past four games in Russia but were behind early when Nacer Chadli’s corner struck Fernandinho’s arm and flew into the net, the 10th own goal of this World Cup. Fernandinho’s Manchester City team-mate Kevin de Bruyne doubled Belgium’s lead with a sublime arrowed finish from 20 yards after Romelu Lukaku’s powerful run. Brazil could find no answer until a 76th-minute headed reply from Renato Augusto, with star man Neymar virtually anonymous other than three poor attempts to win a penalty, although Referee Milorad Mazic perhaps should have pointed to the spot when Vincent Kompany dived in on Gabriel Jesus. Neymar did finally come to life in injury time, forcing a brilliant save from Thibaut Courtois with a curling shot from outside the area, but it was not enough to sustain his team’s challenge. Belgium will battle France, who had earlier on sent Uruguay home with a 2-0 victory, in Saint Petersburg on Tuesday 10th July, for a place in the final of the 2018 FIFA World Cup
