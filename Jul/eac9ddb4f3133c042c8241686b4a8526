American comic actor, Eddie Murphy of ‘Coming to America’ and ‘Shrek’ fame is selling one of his many mega mansions. The 57-year-old entertainer who got his start on Saturday Night Live is unloading his stunning home located in Granite Bay, which is near Sacramento, California and only an hour drive from San Francisco. The 10 bedroom/14 bathroom palace, which sits atop a hill offering sweeping views of the valley below and the Sierra Nevada mountains, is being offered for $10 million. The white villa is 12,600 square feet and has a 1980s over-the-top feeling to it with its light facade and curves in the walls. Its design roots are Mediterranean, and the house does lend a European vibe, but there are so many modern-day accents that it’s more of a California crossover. The spread is listed by Nick Sadek at Sotheby’s International Realty. Eddie owns several mansions: his home in Beverly Hills is a 40,000 square feet wonder in an upscale gated community. This property in North California is one of his smaller homes.
