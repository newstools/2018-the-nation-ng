A Kwara State High Court sitting in Ilorin on Friday summoned the Inspector -General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to appear before it to justify the continued detention of Personal Assistant to Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed,  Lekan Alabi, who was arrested in connection with the April 5 armed robbery in Offa. The court ordered the IGP to appear next Wednesday. Lead counsel to the Alabi, Adebayo Adelodun (SAN), had lamented the failure of the police to release another suspect, Alhaji Babatunde Abdulwahab, the Chief of Staff to the governor, who has been granted bail by another high court in the state. Adelodun, who is leading four other lawyers, told journalists after Friday’s proceeding that the refusal of the police to obey the court’s order on Abdulwahab portends grave danger to democracy and would lead to loss of confidence in the police.
