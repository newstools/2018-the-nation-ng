Katsina State Governor Aminu Masari has called on the people to support security agencies by providing useful information that would be helpful in the arrest and prosecution of criminals. Masari, who spoke yesterday while opening the Malumfashi Area Command Office of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF) on Funtua road, promised that the government will work towards reducing crime, especially through policies like the amnesty introduced for cattle rustlers. Commissioner of Police Muhammad Wakil thanked Masari for rehabilitating their vehicles and offices, and the monthly purchase of petrol and diesel. He harped on the need for community participation to stem crime. The Area Commander, Abdullahi Hassan Maâ€™aji, thanked Masari for providing the office and asked the government to provide the new command with patrol vehicles and other logistics.
