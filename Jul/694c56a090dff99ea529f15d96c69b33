Pan-Yoruba socio-political organisation, Afenifere, said on Tuesday the development in which eight lawmakers in Benue State purportedly suspended 15 of their colleagues and served an impeachment notice on Governor Samuel Ortom was ridiculous. Afenifere said such scenario should not be allowed in any part of Nigeria, adding that the right of citizens to freely associate with any political party of their choice should be devoid of intimidation and direct assault as being placed on Ortom. In a communique issued at the end of its meeting in Akure, Ondo State, Afenifere also condemned the Federal Government for huge deployment of security personnel for the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State. The group said never again should elections be conducted under an atmosphere of fear and intimidation by police, Department of State Service (DSS) and other security agents in Nigeria. The communique read: “The meeting considered the widespread use of money as instrument of election into public office by contestants and their parties. And insists that INEC as the regulatory authority on electoral matters must take visible and credible steps to prosecute offenders to make this practice impossible in future elections. “Afenifere demands from INEC to adhere to the highest standard in election transparency, failing which Nigeria will lose faith in its ability to conduct free, fair and credible election in 2019. “On security, we will continue to be highly disturbed by the degenerating situation of the country’s security. Excessive migration from the north especially by unskilled youths beyond gives cause for concern. “It is our view that the federal government’s failure to take decisive steps in curtailing security breaches has not only emboldened perpetrators, it is accentuating insecurity and seriously endangering the lives of millions of Nigerians.”
