The Olubadan of Ibadan, Oba Saliu Akanmu Adetunji, has said though it is not in his character to celebrate birthdays, he is proposing to celebrate his 90th birthday anniversary on August 26 because his late father, who died in 1989, did not live to be 90. The first-class monarch announced this yesterday at his Popoyemoja, Ibadan palace while inaugurating a 16-member birthday anniversary committee, led by former Minister of Special Duties and Sport, Prof. Taoheed Adedoja. Oba Adetunji, who said to live long is not a right but a privilege, added that his intention is to use the birthday anniversary to celebrate Ibadan and its diverse people and pray for the unity and stability of Nigeria. The Olubadan stressed that even though he is from a family with an impressive record of longevity, his late dad, Raji Olayiwola, who died in 1989, died at 89. He said God should be praised for making him live beyond his fatherâ€™s age. Oba Adetunji noted that the responsibility ahead of the birthday anniversary committee is onerous, said he was confident in the integrity of the committee members. Besides Prof. Adedoja, other members of the committee are: Niyi Ajewole, Personal Assistant to Olubadan, Mr. Adeola Oloko, Lere Adigun, Alhaji Ambali Adetunji, Alhaji Rasheed Oladejo and Alhaja Simiat Adeleke Larodo. Others are: Mr. Lateef Gbadamosi, Comrade Yinka Akinpelu, Alhaji Kola Animasaun, Prince Lanre Ogundipe, Chief Waheed Ekun, Mr. Olajide Laniyonu and representative of the apex body of Ibadan indigenes, the CCII, Mr. Ademola Alabi and Mrs Laide Gesinde and the representative of Oyo State government. Adedoja expressed gratitude to the monarch for the confidence reposed in his committee. He promised that it would do its job in line with its mandate.
