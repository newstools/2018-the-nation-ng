Worried by the alarming rate of street begging and its negative impact within the state, Lagos State Commissioner for Youth and Social Development Agboola Dabiri has reiterated the stance for zero tolerance on street begging. Agboola said this at a meeting held with Stakeholders on curbing the menace of street begging in Lagos. According to him available, statistics indicates that despite the law enforcement agenciesâ€™ efforts at curbing the menace, beggars had become recalcitrant and they sometimes engage in criminal activities while parading as beggars. According to him, the facilities which the government built to serve as transit home for rescued beggars and destitute is over stretched, hence, the urgent need for stakeholders to find a lasting solution to the problem. Justice Kazeem Alogba said there is need to amend the law that prohibits street begging, whereby the givers and beggars as well as their suspected godfathers are made to face a stiffer penalty if caught. The judge pointed out that begging is not accepted even in the Holy Quran, as people who want money should work for it. Spokesperson of the Arewa Community, Alhaji Kabiru thanked the State Government for her warmth reception since their settlement in the state 173 years ago. Alhaji Kabiru said the community would ensure strict compliance and live within the laws of Lagos State.
