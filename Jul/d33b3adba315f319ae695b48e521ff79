To combat youth unemployment, the Lagos State Government has organised a job fair for unemployed graduates in the state. The fair was organised by the Ministry of Wealth Creation and Employment in conjunction with Ist CRT Group on Saturday at Adeyemi Bero Hall at Alausa, Ikeja. About 1,500 graduates participated in the fair, which was also attended by 11 companies. The ministry’s Permanent Secretary, Mrs Ganiat Raji, said the fair was organised as a meeting point for job seekers and employers. ”The present administration of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has spent so much on this programme and other initiatives to tackle unemployment in the state. ”The opportunity given by today’s job fair is to fast track meeting between you (employees) and employers is also immeasurable. The employers are here to exchange to also exchange ideas on future job opportunities.” She urged the participants to acquire technical or vocational skills that can stand them out either as employees or employers. Managing Director of Ist CRT Group Ms Folayemi Olaitan said the fair was informed by the need to create opportunities for young graduates to excel.
