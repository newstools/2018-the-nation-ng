The Lagos State government has urged all Directors/Heads of Finance and Accounts Departments in all the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of the state to sustain the impressive procurement and payment processes which ensured transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. The state Accountant General, Abimbola Umar, who spoke during the second quarterly technical meeting organised by the State Treasury Office (STO) for Directors/Head of Finance in Lagos, said the success story of Lagos, especially in the area of effective management of resources, has put the state in an enviable position. She urged them to always strive for excellence through prudent management of scarce resources. The General Manager, Lagos State Public Procurement Agency, Fatai Onafowote, in a lecture titled: “Effective and Sustainable Procurement System in Lagos State, Partnering for Development”, said professionals in the accounting field are to ensure good governance through transparency, inclusiveness and competitiveness, using a procurement system that supports the state’s development goals and engender public trust. While highlighting some of the steps involved in procuring goods and services for government, Onafowote underscored the need for all heads of MDAs to involve their Procurement Officers from planning to project implementation. “Finance and Accounts Officers apart from carrying the Procurement Officers along, should also ensure that necessary sign-offs are sought and consider the availability of fund for proper execution of project,’’ he said. He also advised the officers to confirm that the preferred contractor or supplier for the project is registered with the state government and adhere to the use of procurement standard template for making a request. He added that the monitoring unit of the Agency will soon commence scheduled and unscheduled visits to the sites of various on-going capital projects to certify that they conform to a contractual agreement.
