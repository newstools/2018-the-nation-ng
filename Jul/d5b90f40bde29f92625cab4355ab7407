While we slept, Duncan Mighty, popularly known as Wene Mighty came and filled our ears with songs. As hilarious as it might seem, some artistes have a way of reasserting their presence when least expected, and such has been the case for the Rivers State born artiste. The ‘Port Harcourt First son’ who came into the Nigerian Music industry as a producer and sound engineer in 2006 and later delved into the singing aspect which apparently paid off and he stuck to. In 2010, his second studio album, Legacy(Ahamefuna) made him the rave of the industry, with its frontline single, Port Harcourt Son gaining him airplay even in Lagos and also earning him the nickname and title; Port Harcourt First Son. He continued to make music and released three other albums up until 2016, which didn’t get as much airplay. After being reportedly involved in politics and oil business in the Niger Delta for so long, one would think the art of music making was lost on him already; but he surprised us with a comeback hit in May 2018, featuring Wizkid titled Fake Love. The hype around the song’s release was intense, fortunately it was accepted by fans of both stars and got massive air play. Even after 5 albums to his name; Duncan Mighty has found a way over the years, to stay relevant and ever dynamic as he continues doling out back to back hits. With the magnitude of acceptance the collaboration with Wizkid got, he went on to feature on Ceeza Milli’s Sabi and Masterkraft’s Low Waist which also features Flavour. Other features are on the Mavin label’s golden boy, Reekado Bank’s Bio Bio, DJ Xclusive’s Gimme Love and a couple others. The artiste has been sighted on social media recently with Nigerian Afro fusion/Reggae/Dancehall artiste Burnaboy in the studio, fueling rumors of a possible collaboration in the nearest future. We can only keep our fingers crossed and hope that Wene Mighty keeps serving us dope music.
