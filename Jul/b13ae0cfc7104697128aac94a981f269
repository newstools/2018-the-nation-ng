Forty-eight political parties are to contest the Osun State governorship election, Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has said. The election will hold on September 22. The commission also announced August 18 as the date for Rivers and Taraba states’ by-elections. This brings to six the by-elections the commission will conduct before the Osun poll. INEC Chairman Prof. Yakubu Mahmood, who spoke yesterday at the swearing-in of two Resident Electoral Commissioners (RECs), said the commission was processing  forms for the Osun poll. The two RECs – Mr. Garba Attahiru Madami and Ahmad Bello Mahmud – are to resume work immediately. He said: “A record number of 48 political parties have nominated candidates for the election. The commission is currently processing the nomination form. “Our preparation for the Osun State governorship election continues in earnest. Nomination of candidates closed yesterday (Tuesday) in line with the timetable and schedule of activities released by the commission in October last year.” For the by-elections in Rivers and Taraba states, Mahmood said the timetable and schedule of activities would be out today after the commission’s weekly meeting. Also, Madami and Mahmud were posted to Kwara and Kebbi. Madami hails from Niger State, while Mahmud is from Zamfara State. In line with INEC rules, they are not allowed to serve in their states of origin. Mahmood urged the RECs to familiarise themselves with the relevant provisions of the 1999 Constitution (as amended), the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended), the commission’s plans, guidelines and regulations as well as established processes and procedures. He assured them of the commission’s support as they discharge their duties. Madami promised the RECs will obey the oaths of office and contribute to free, fair and transparent elections.
