President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday promised to sign the Continental Free Trade Agreement (CFTA) soon. He gave the commitment during a joint briefing at the end of South African President, Cyril Ramaphosa’s visit to the Presidential Villa, Abuja. Buhari said he is still studying the agreement but noted that he is careful about what he signs, saying that many Nigerian industries that will provide jobs for the teeming youths are still coming up and would not be exposed to unfavorable competition. He said: “I am very careful about what I sign whether it is my cheque book or agreements especially when it involves nations and states. As your President has said, we are so populated and have so many young unemployed citizens and our industries are just coming up. “So, in trying to guarantee employment, goods and services in our country, we have to be careful with agreements that will compete maybe successfully against our upcoming industries. “I was presented with the document; I am a very slow reader maybe, because I am an ex- soldier. I didn’t read it fast enough before my officials saw that it was all right for signature. I kept it on my table. I will soon sign it.” On the frequent killings of Nigerians in South Africa, Ramaphosa said the killings were not intentional. According to him, what led to the killings were acts of criminality, which his administration is determined to end. He said: “There has been quite a number of incidences in our country where foreign nationals some of whom are Nigerians have lost their lives and are being attacked. I will like to say here and now that has been as a result of criminal activity among our own people which we are focusing on from a criminal element point of view.
