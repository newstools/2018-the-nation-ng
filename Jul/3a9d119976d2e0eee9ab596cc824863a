Former President Goodluck Jonathan on Wednesday had a private meeting with former President Ibrahim Babangida at his Uphill home in Minna, Niger State. Jonathan, who came to Niger by road, arrived the ex- military ruler’s home at about 10:00 a.m. in an entourage of six black Prado Jeeps. A source at Babangida’s home said the meeting which was attended by a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 2019 gubernatorial aspirant in the state, Alhaji Hanafi Muazu Sudan, was a private one. The meeting lasted almost two hours and Jonathan drove out of Babangida’s home at 12: 47 p.m.
