An All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain  and Federal House of Representatives aspirant, Chief Shina Abiola Peller, has  debunked claims that the party in Oyo State is factionalized. Speaking at the flag-off of his aspiration to represent the Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa federal constituency, Peller said APC is united and stronger than ever. He urged Nigerians to ignore the rumour as such news is only being circulated by mischief makers. “I don’t believe there are factions within APC in Oyo State, what I believe and preach is that, we are as strong as we are united and we are as weak as we are divided. I know the noise about factions and division is to weaken our strength as a party and confuse us as a people. Therefore, I will never ever in my life entertain any faction. APC is one in Oyo State and we will do everything within our power to make sure that unity is maintained,” he said. “My people know my worth and my achievements. The young people of Nigeria are the most powerful single block in the country. We would not allow ourselves to be used by people who do not have our interest at heart,” he stated. In his words, the Executive Chairman, Itesiwaju Local Government of Oyo State, Mr. Niyi Adeagbo noted that Shina Peller’s declaration and the wealth of experience he is bringing into politics will set a high standard for 2019 political aspirants in Oyo State.
