THE Chairman Senate Committee on Culture and Tourism, Chief Fatima  Raji Rasaki, was one of the successful global students who passed the Harvard Kennedy Executive Education Training Programme held in Cambridge, MA, USA  and bagged a Certificate in Leaders in Development. Rasaki, who joined other world executive students at acquiring knowledge under the mentorship and tutelage of the Centre for Public Leadership, Harvard Kennedy School, has been conferred with a fellowship of the school having successfully passed the examination and participated actively at every session. Rasaki’s set has the singular opportunity of being tutored by past presidents, faculty leaders and researchers who took those courses in leadership, followership perception, policy formulation, implementation and assessment. The former president of Ecuador, Jamil Mahuad, one of the lecturers, commended her for her diligence and studiousness, noting that ‘she has demonstrated a rare quest for educational advancement and comprehension of concepts.” The newly graduated student revealed that “coming to study at Harvard Kennedy is a great opportunity. It is another milestone in my life and a purely mental refurbishing adventure which has opened my intellectual horizon beyond the micro level of thinking and reasoning. My vision and focus have been honed. It will be to the advantage of me, my state, the nation and my work at the Senate.”
