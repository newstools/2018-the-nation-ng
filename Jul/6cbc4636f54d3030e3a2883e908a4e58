In order to officially meet with her fans after the launch of her book, ‘Boss Up’, Nollywood actress Chika Ike is set to sign autographs today. The event takes place in Lagos, according to the Ike, who recently joined the league of actors-turned-authors. “Having my first official book signing today Saturday the 7th of July; so if you are based in Lagos and will like to get an autograph book from me,  send a Dm to @Bossupbook,” she wrote. The book, which was written as a guide to living a good life, took the actress seven years to write and publish. “Seven years of documenting my thoughts, emotions, truth and events that taught me some life lessons and brought me to this point. Three years ago before my mum passed on, she was also an author and was aware of my unpublished book. She looked at me, held my hands and told me to tell my truth. I’m a very guarded person, my walls are up because life has thrown me so many curved balls; I brought down all my walls in this book, because the truth is we are on this earth to share and not just to take. “I finally bossed up and got my book published. ‘Boss Up’ is one of my ways of giving back.” Ike is a successful filmmaker; a Harvard-trained business woman and a philanthropist, who is passionate about empowering young people.
