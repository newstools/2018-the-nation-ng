The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has hailed yesterday’s Supreme Court judgment discharging and acquitting the President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Saraki. In a statement by the spokesman for the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party described the verdict as triumph of justice. In the landmark judgment, the apex court had dismissed the assets declaration case brought against Saraki by the Federal Government before the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). The party said the Supreme Court, by the judgment, has further reinforced the confidence of Nigerian citizens in the courage of the institution of the judiciary, as the temple of justice and the last hope of the common man, particularly under an oppressive regime. The PDP  stated that the judgment has further supported its disposition that the Buhari Presidency’s fight against corruption was mere shadow-chasing and a clever attempt at blackmailing the opposition as well as anyone who holds a divergent voice against the administration.
