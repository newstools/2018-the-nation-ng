The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Ekiti State, Prof. Kolapo Olusola Eleka, said on Saturday he was sure of victory because it was divinely ordained. Asked for his prediction after casting his vote, he said: “I am a man who lives by faith. Right from the beginning I’ve always known that it’s a journey that is ordained by God. “And any journey that is ordained by God definitely will be a success. By His grace, God will see me through; I’m going to coast to victory.” There was a chorus of “amen” by his supporters and those who accompanied him to the polling booth.
