Budding musician Daniel Ajilore known as D’New has teamed up with DMW artiste Mayorkun to release his song titled ‘Popoju.’ The artiste expressed optimism for the success of the love song. “I feel happy joining hands together with him to move Hip Hop music forward in the spirit of one love in order to promote, contribute and encourage unity in the genre of music in Nigeria and beyond,” said D’new, whose songs include ‘For You’ and ‘Kejike’. “It is a delight to collaborate with him to jointly entertain our fans and music lovers.” The young artiste also revealed that he was born into music and grew up playing various musical instruments. “I started playing musical instrument(s), developed passion for music, as well as love dancing as a young boy. According to my parents, I was dumped in the choir at my tender age when my passion for music was too obvious. My passion for music increased to the extent that I cannot do without listening to song, especially good songs. All these qualities became useful when I eventually took it up professionally and the experience has been awesome. I am confident and loaded to carve a niche for myself in the game.”
