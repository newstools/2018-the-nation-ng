BENEATH his seemingly low profile traits in virtually all his endeavours, all indications point to one fact: that enterprising Oghenetega Efedede is one undisputable and successful Nigerian entrepreneur who has proved that the first thing needed in the entrepreneurship journey is not money, but action, perseverance, passion and the will to make it. Efedede is the CEO of Cape Music Entertainment Television, (CMETV). CMETV is a pan African cable television channel launched in 2017. The channel started online and is set to hit the TV screens this year. There was a lot of buzz recently over his just-concluded music talent hunt competition where hundreds of talents were discovered, with Adedara Oluwaseun Abayomi, aka Skriptzz, emerging as the winner of the competition. The competitions were aimed at promoting Nigerianâ€™s raw talents, and ultimately unleashing them on Africa and the world at large. The winner (Skriptzz) was rewarded with a cash reward of N100,000.00 with a complimentary video to be shot for him, while his song would also be promoted online, radio, TV and clubs.
