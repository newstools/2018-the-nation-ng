Kano State Commissioner for Agriculture Nasiru Yusuf Gawuna has signified his intention to contest the Kano Central Senatorial District seat presently occupied by former governor Rabiu Kwankwaso. Gawuna, who spoke at Gawuna Ward in Nasarawa Local Government Area, said he is not scared of any bigwig currently occupying the seat due to his political record and grassroots support. He said: “My decision to declare my intention at the ward level follows my conviction that any result-oriented politician must respect the party’s ward leadership if he determined to make a significant impact in politics. “My people know who Gawuna is and the kind of politics I play. They also know that the fear of any contest is not part of my political life, which entails that we are going out fully to clinch the seat.” Gawuna thanked Governor Abdullahi Ganduje for the confidence reposed in him and for allowing him steer the affairs of one of the biggest ministries. “I am still a member of the Kano State Executive Council and I believe Governor Ganduje, knowing his political dispositions, would not interfere with the primaries when it comes to our contest. “I know that he has full confidence in me and what I can do, just like what I did in the agric ministry.”
