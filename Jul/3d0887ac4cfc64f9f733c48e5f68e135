The convoy of Plateau State Governor Simon Lalong was yesterday attacked by displaced persons living at Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Camp in Jos. The incident occurred when he visited one of the IDPs at Zawan to give relief materials to the IDPs. Stones were thrown at the governor’s car and the vehicles of his entourage that included his Deputy, Prof.  Sonni Tyoden. Windscreens of many cars were smashed but the governor escaped unhurt as stones could not penetrate his bullet proof car. When Governor Lalong arrived at the IDP camp,   the displaced persons started murmuring: ‘We don’t want relief materials; we want to go back to our ancestral homes’. Lalong, in an address before the stoning, assured the people that the State Government would do what it could to address challenges being faced by the Internally Displaced Persons. The governor said he visited the IDP camp to see for himself the condition of the displaced persons and ensure that they received the relief materials released by government. He urged them to be patient as government was working hard to ensure that their security is guaranteed before they are relocated to their homes. Governor Lalong who said government will hunt and arrest their attackers reiterated that he would not allow their ancestral land to be grabbed.
