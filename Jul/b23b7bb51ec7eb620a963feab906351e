The International Press Centre (IPC), Lagos, has condemned the attack on the Secretary of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Osun State Council, and other journalists, on Monday. Reports have it that “suspected hoodlums attacked journalists at a news conference addressed by members of the State Working Committee (SWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “The Secretary of NUJ, Osun State Council, Mr. Bamigbola Boladale, was not spared in the ugly incident, as he was beaten up by thugs, who tore his clothes.” IPC Director Lanre Arogundade, in a statement, described the attack as unacceptable. He said: “This kind of act is not acceptable from any individual or group because journalists are not to be treated as animals. They deserve the right to perform their duties without fear or intimidation. “IPC demands that the Police commissioner should probe this assault and take action, while the culprits should be made to face the consequences of their actions.” Arogundade advised journalists to ensure they are well guided. He sought assurance of their safety in covering factional crisis of parties.
