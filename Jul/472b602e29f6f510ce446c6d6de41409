Pre-tournament favourites Brazil have been eliminated from the World Cup by Belgium at the quarter-final stage, falling to a 2-1 defeat in yesterday evening’s gripping clash at the Kazan Stadium. Belgium stunned their opponents by taking a two-goal lead into the interval after Kevin De Bruyne brilliantly added to a Fernandinho own goal. The Red Devils were able to see things through for just a second-ever appearance in the semis, despite being made to hold on in the final 15 minutes following a consolation header from Renato Augusto. While five-time winners Brazil will head back home, prolonging their wait for glory on the world stage to at least 20 years, Belgium now have a semi-final against France – victorious against Uruguay earlier today – to look forward to in St Petersburg next Tuesday. Both managers made a couple of changes to their starting lineups, with Marouane Fellaini and Nacer Chadli – key players in the 3-2 comeback win over Japan in the last round – both coming in for Belgium. Fernandinho was one of the two Brazil players brought into the side, meanwhile, along with fit-again Marcelo, and it was the Manchester City midfielder who gifted the opposition a 13th-minute lead. Eden Hazard’s left-sided corner dipped towards the front post and Fernandinho got a telling touch of the ball with his arm to help it past Alisson. The game had been pretty evenly matched up until that point, although the Selecao had done more to warrant a lead as Thiago Silva hit the post from close range when picked out from a corner. Philippe Coutinho cut inside in trademark style to test Thibaut Courtois for the first time, before Marcelo did likewise as Brazil attempted to exploit their opponents down the left wing.
