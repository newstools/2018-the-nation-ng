Real Madrid star Sergio Ramos is now engaged to long-term girlfriend, Pilar Rubio, having popped the question while the pair were on holiday. Ramos has been taking some downtime following his World Cup heartache, which saw Spain crash out to Russia in the round of 16. But the Spanish captain now has reason to cheer after his girlfriend of six years accepted his proposal at a romantic dinner on Monday evening. Ramos shared the news on Instagram with two pictures of himself accompanied by his bride-to-be and her new huge ring. The images were captioned with a simple: ‘She said yes. I love you… forever.’ The pair were dressed to the nines and had a late night, romantic dinner on a balcony where Ramos brought his fiancee a bouquet of flowers, as well as the diamond rock. Ramos has been dating Spanish TV presenter and journalist, Rubio, since 2012. Rubio, 40, was previously a model and and has also won awards for best television reporter. For the past four years she has been working on Spanish comedy show, El Hormiguero. They have three children together, all boys. The oldest, Sergio, was born in May 2014 and the two younger children are named, Marco and Alejandro – the latter of which was born in March this year Ramos has made the most of his time off having taken his family on holiday and will now return to Madrid with a fiancee. He will soon have to team up the squad for pre-season, having had his time off earlier than he would have hoped following Spain’s premature World Cup exit. He will also join up with new manager, Julen Lopetegui, who he will know well from his time with the Spanish national team, but will have to get accustomed to life without Cristiano Ronaldo who completed a £100million to Juventus on Monday.
