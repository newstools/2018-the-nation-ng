A frojazz singer, Bisade Ologunde, aka Lagbaja has returned to Nigeria after a long while, and will be performing at the Johnnie, Jazz & Whisky (#JJW); Nigeria’s premier Afrojazz platform in Abuja, where sonorous songstress, Simi is also billed to perform. The event which kicks off at 7pm on Saturday July 28, 2018 at Central Park Arena, Abuja, will have the superstars deliver performances at an evening of good conversation, networking and diverse blends of the famous Johnnie Walker Black Label. Simi, while foretelling the evening as a night of music and flavours in a promotional video, says: “I have always wondered what my creamy and tropical flavour would be like if it mixes with Lagbaja’s Smoky feel. I think you and I can find that out at the Johnnie Jazz & Whisky in Abuja.”
