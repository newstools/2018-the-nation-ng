Members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) in Ogbomosho yesterday threatened to begin an indefinite strike if the owner-states of Oyo and Osun refuse to fulfil their agreement with the union. A joint statement by its Chairman, Biodun Olaniran, and Secretary, Toyin Abegunrin, expressed surprise that the two governments refused to fund the university, even after it audited its personnel and accounts. LAUTECH recently resumed from its eight month-old strike after the two states agreed to pay outstanding debt to the institution. ASUU said the institution lacked adequate funding, while its workers were owed 10 monthsâ€™ salary and promotion arrears, among others. The union noted that besides non-payment of salary and other entitlements, there has been no infrastructural development on campus since the inception of the administration in Oyo and Osun states.
