A Sokoto State Chief Magistratesâ€™ Court has ordered that an 18-year-old man, Mohammed Bello, charged with committing homosexual act, be remanded in prison. The Chief Magistrate, Abubakar Adamu, gave the order on Friday after Bello, a trader of Gagi Area, Sokoto, pleaded guilty to a two-count charge of unnatural offence. Adamu said the court lacked jurisdiction over the matter and adjourned the case until July 21 for mention and possible transfer to a competent court. The Prosecutor, Abubakar Tambuwal, had told the court that the accused committed the offence between February and April. Tambuwal said that the accused intentionally lured a 10-year-old boy into his room and had sexual intercourse with him against the order of nature. The prosecutor said the offence contravened the Penal Code.
