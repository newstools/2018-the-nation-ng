The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has condoled with the government and people of Katsina State over the passing of former Inspector General of Police (IGP), Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie, who passed on last Thursday, after a protracted illness. In a statement, Obaseki said that Coomassie’s death was a loss to Nigeria, the Arewa Consultative Forum, which he chairs, as well as his family. “I condole with the Katsina State Governor, Alhaji Aminu Bello Masari and the people of the state over the passing of former IGP, Alhaji Ibrahim Coomassie. The former IGP served Nigeria gallantly and worked for the progress of the country as evidenced in the various assignments he held,” he said. He added that the death occurred when Nigeria needed the wisdom of her senior citizens in resolving challenges facing the country, noting that late Coomassie’s strong influence was also felt in his position as the chairman of Arewa Consultative Forum. He added, “We are consoled that he was a courageous Nigerian and one who worked for the good of the country.” Late Alhaji Coomassie until his death held the traditional title as Sardaunan Katsina.
