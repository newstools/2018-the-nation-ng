The prosecution of one Kadiri Siaka by the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), over illegal electricity connection was on Friday stalled due to the absence of a prosecution witness. Siaka was docked in a Wuse Zone 6 Magistrates’ Court, Abuja, on July 4, on a count charge of illegal electricity connection. When the case came up for hearing, NSCDC’s counsel, PureHeart Agabaenwere, told the court that the witness he intended to examine was not in court. Aganaenwere urged the court to step down the case pending when the witness will be in court. The Chief Magistrate, Theresa Otu, however, adjourned the case until Aug. 27 for definite hearing. The prosecution had alleged that the defendant trespassed into the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) property and illegally connected electricity into his shop. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge and was granted bail in the sum of N100,000 with a surety in like sum. The offence contravened the provisions of Section 286 sub (2) of the Penal Code.
