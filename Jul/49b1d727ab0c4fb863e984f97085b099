After losing out in his quest to retain the men’s singles title in 2017, Finland’s Olah Benedek is hoping that his lost laurel will be reclaimed this year when the 2018 ITTF Challenge Nigeria Open serves off on August 8 at the Molade Okoya-Thomas Hall, Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos. In his first visit to Nigeria in 2016, Benedek Olah returned to Finland with his first ITTF title after emerging the champion in the men’s singles of the Nigeria Open. Impressed with his maiden experience, Benedek Olah decided to make a second return in 2017, but his journey was short-lived when he failed to measure up with his podium place in 2016. However, Benedek Olah has indeed enjoyed his visits to the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria, Lagos and the 27-year-old is always willing to return. “The audience during the matches is something to always look forward to and enjoy. Also, the fans are willing to show emotions and make some noise during competitive rally in matches. Nigeria Open is special compared to what obtains in Europe. The lack of backhand by the players is heavily compensated with forehand, with a lot of spins and coupled with good footwork. Also, I see that their backhand services are also different to what we were used to in Europe,” Benedek Olah admitted. “I am in better form than last year but this year the tournament seems harder with better players which I find super cool. Also, the hotel accommodation is very amazing with good food. The audience is always lively, while the venue is always filled to capacity from the first day and this is what you don’t see in Europe.” “The Nigeria Open is very special to me because it was there I won my first international title. I am always willing to return because the condition is good for me to win and it is not the same as other tournaments. I also meet some new friends and it is always nice to come back and see them.”
