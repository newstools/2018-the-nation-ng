A former Commissioner for Finance in Sokoto State, Farouk Malami Yabo, has declared his intention to contest for governor on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Yabo vowed to challenge Governor Aminu Tambuwalý. ýYabo, who served in the administration of former Governor Aliyu Wamakko, promised to reposition the state on the path of economic prosperity, strengthen its values, empower and encourage self-reliance among youth, women and the physically challenged. He said: “Sokoto State needs to be transformed and revived economically through job creation to make it an enterprising hub.” The former commissioner said such can best be achieved by diversifying the economy by improving on farming. He urged party faithful to work for its victory in the elections. Yabo said: “My declaration is informed by the passion and vision to advance the state on a new economic, political and infrastructural stream, better than its present state for the benefit of all.”
