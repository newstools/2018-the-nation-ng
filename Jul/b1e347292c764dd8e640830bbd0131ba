Students of the Obafemi Awolowo University ( OAU ) Ile Ife have expressed fear over the heavy flood which sacked residents from their community. The flood, The Nation gathered, was as a result of heavy downpour of rain which lasted over seven hours on Sunday. The heavy downpour led to destruction of properties, caused harm to the Ife community and led residents leaving their houses. James Ibrahim, one of the affected students said the heavy flood as caused serious harm as all their properties were carted away by the rain.  “I lost my clothes and other belongings to the flood. I am even scared to stay in the house because I don’t know the havoc that might happen when the next it rains.” Another student, Funmi Ilori who narrated the incident said “I was sleeping in my room when I started feeling that my bed was becoming wet, I thought I had poured water before I slept off but I noticed that it was getting too much I had to stand up but before I could know what was happening, my room was getting flooded but it was God that saved me that I had to find my way out of the room.”  “I have never experienced this kind of disaster in my life; I never knew it could happen to me. The flood has rendered us homeless” In her view, Sikirat Bashiru, an indigene of Ife urged the government to assist the residents in clearing the drainages, adding; “All our belongings have been destroyed by the flood.”
