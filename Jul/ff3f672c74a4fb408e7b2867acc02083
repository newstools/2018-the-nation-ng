Russian based Nigerian players license agent, Olanrewaju Oladebo is set to bring top football scouts from Zenith St. Petersburg and Lokomotiv Moscow to Nigeria for talent hunt. The soccer agent who has transferred close to about 10 players from Lagos academy Natthy  FC said  the five-day scouting event billed to hold from August 5th to 10th, will be done in three centers in Lagos, Ekiti and Ogun State. He said it is his personal wish to ensure that more players hit stardom just like some of the products of his academy who are making waves abroad for their respective clubs. “Nigeria is no doubt blessed with abundance of young and talented players who are only waiting for the opportunity to showcase their talents to those that can help them achieve their dreams. This is the reason we are bringing scouts from respectable clubs such as Zenith St. Petersburg and Lokomotiv Moscow. “This talent hunt event will afford the Scouts the opportunity to select first hand from these outstanding talents that will be showcased at the program,” Oladebo said. Natty Football Club recently won the Agege Goals Cup beating FC Agama on penalties. Natthy FC is also co-owned by Super Eagles forward and Russia based star Sylvester Igboun who plays for Fc Ufa in the Russian League.
