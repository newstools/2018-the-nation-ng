The Debt Management Office (DMO) is planning a green bond programme before the end of the year to raise funds for environmental projects, a junior minister for the environment said at the weekend. Ibrahim Jibril said the capital market could see issues of around N208 billion ($682 million) this year to fund projects to reduce carbon emissions. The ministry said the total figure was not fixed and would depend on an evaluation of the projects that need funding. “Before the year runs out, the DMO will come up with a programme where we will come to the market for another issue,” Jibril told reporters at the listing of its debut green bond on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Nigeria has been exploring options to fund its successive record budgets, especially after an oil price collapse in the late 2014 that triggered a recession two years later. The economy has since recovered, but growth is still fragile. The environment ministry has said a bond programme for environmental projects is part of the government’s aim to align with a global objective of expanding the market for finance for efforts to fight climate change. Last year, the country issued a maiden N10.69 billion green bond with a five-year tenor to fund projects to develop renewable energy. It was listed on Friday for secondary trading.
