The Benin National Congress has rejected plans by the Federal Government to include Edo State as one of the pilot state for its cattle ranching scheme. It said it would mobilize youths, women and artisans to protest against establishing ranches in any parts of the state. President of the BNC, Mr. Aiyamenkhue Edokpolor, stated this while briefing journalists at the end of the group’s emergency meeting in Benin City, the Edo State capital. Edokpolor said farm lands in the state have been abandoned and deserted because of herdsmen activities. He said the Benins should not be punished because of their hospitality. Edokpolor also urged Governor Godwin Obaseki to ask the Federal Government to include youths on Bénin extraction into the amnesty programme. According to him, “Rising from an emergency meeting today, we wish to respectfully remind Edo State Governor that Benin youths are worried over their exclusion from the amnesty program. “Our counterparts in Niger Delta are enjoying skill acquisition and scholarship programs of the amnesty office under the National Security Adviser, and our youths are completely excluded because our people have not shown inclination and tenacity in armed militancy. “Our senatorial district is host to the largest gas terminal in West Africa, oil and gas pipelines transverses our seven Local Government Areas, and oil and has have been discovered in very large proportions in six out of seven LGAs of our areas. “We are appealing to the coordinator of the Amnesty program Prof. Charles Dokubor not to succumb to the antics of his predecessors who undermined peaceful ethnic nationalities and dealt only with warring communities.”
