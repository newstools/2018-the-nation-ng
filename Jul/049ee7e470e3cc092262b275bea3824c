Members of the Kano State House of Assembly on Thursday reiterated their unflinching support and loyalty to the All Progressive Congress (APC). The Speaker of the House, Yusuf Abdullahi Ata, stated this while dispelling rumour of defection of some APC members to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He said the Assembly has 40 members from the 44 local government areas in the state and 33 of those members are loyal to Governor Abdullahi Ganduje and President Muhammadu Buhari. He said six members who are staunch followers of former governor Rabiu Kwankwaso as well as one PDP member who clinched the mandate through the Supreme Court judgement “are still with us.”
