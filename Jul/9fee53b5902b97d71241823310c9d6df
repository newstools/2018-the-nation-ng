The Federal High Court in Lagos on Tuesday dismissed a no-case submission made by former Abia State Governor, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu. Justice Mohammed Idris held that he has a case to answer in the money laundering charge brought against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). EFCC alleged that Kalu, he was governor between 2001 and September 2006, procured Slok Nigeria Limited, a company owned by him and members of his family, to retain N7.2billion in the Inland Bank Plc account, on his behalf. The Commission said the money “formed part of the funds illegally derived from the treasury of Abia State government and converted to several bank drafts before they were paid into the said company’s account.” Kalu was accused of collaborating with Udeh Jones Udeogu, Slok Nigeria Limited and Emeka Abone (at large) “in concealing the genuine origin of N7,197,871,208.70.” He pleaded not guilty to an amended 39-count charge which EFCC said violates Section 17(c) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2004, and was liable to be punished under Section 16. The defendants had filed no-case submissions, urging the court to dismiss and acquit them as the prosecution’s case was “watery.”
