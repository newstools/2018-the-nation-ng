Borno State Police Commissioner Damian Chukwu said he is making frantic efforts to pacify the aggrieved policemen who embarked on an early morning protest in Maiduguri, Borno State capital over unpaid allowances. According to Mr. Chukwu, the issue will soon be resolved as the 2018 budget has just been signed into law. The Borno CP however disclosed that only five months outstanding allowances are been owed to the protesters as against the 7 or 6 months being reported by some section of the media. “We woke up this morning to experience a protest at the State HQ gate by visiting PMF men in Borno State over unpaid special duty allowances for 5 months running. “We are making efforts to pacify them and to assure them of their payments of entitlements soonest especially now that FG Budget issues are being fast resolved by the Federal Government,” CP Chukwu disclosed. The CP also appeal that steps be urgently taken to proffer lasting solution to the problem. The Nation reports that armed Mopol took to the streets of Maiduguri protesting over their unpaid allowances with the JTF.
