A former Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) President Dr Olisa Agbakoba (SAN) has endorsed a former Nigerian Law School Deputy Director-General Prof Ernest Ojukwu (SAN) for the association’s presidency. Agbakoba said in a statement: “It is clear to me from the list of contestants that Prof Ojukwu is the most qualified. Ernest worked closely with me on many thematic subjects of reform when I was NBA president. He was extremely resourceful. “I also know he immensely contributed to the success of past presidents such as Chief Okpoko (SAN), OCJ Okocha (SAN), Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), Bayo Ojo (SAN), Prince Lanke Odogiyan, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu (SAN) etc. “He has clear vision and understanding of the workings of the Bar and the legal profession at the highest level. NBA needs Prof. Ojukwu’s leadership experience, integrity, sincerity, and courage. “I believe that the Bar needs a President who can stand as did Thomas Erskine, in England, and declare bravely that: ‘I will at all hazard, protect the independence’ of the Nigerian Bar and the legal profession. “We need a man of courage and conviction who has a full grasp of issues not just of the Bar, but also of our nation and will be able to speak out with courage, conviction and candour. I have read the manifestos of all the candidates. Prof Ojukwu’s is inspiring. I endorse him.”
