Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) Director-General, Dr Dakuku Peterside, has blamed foreign and indigenous ship owners for abusing the waivers granted them by the agency. Speaking with The Nation on the sideline of the interactive meeting  with stakeholders in Calabar, he said the agency has suspended the issuance of Cabotage waivers to ship owners because of the problem. He however said the suspension was temporal. Also, the agency’s Executive Director (ED), Marine and Operations, Mr Rotimi Fashakin, said the issuance of waivers was supposed to be a stop gap to boost local capacity in manning, flagging owning and building of vessels that operate within the country. According to him, Nigerian ship operators apply for manning waivers to employ foreigners. “If Nigerians cannot employ Nigerian seafarers, then who will do that?” he asked. The ED stated that if the problem continued unchecked, the development of local capacity would fail. “The provision of waivers in the Cabotage Act of 2003 is meant to be an exception, instead of the norm as is being witnessed currently, even indigenous operators seek for waivers on issues, such as manning. “If the indigenous operators are not ready to employ Nigerians, on what moral grounds can we compel the foreigners to do same? “The agency has decided to suspend the issuance of waivers on manning for now. A marine notice has been issued to this effect. “As we have endeavoured to demonstrate in this report, NIMASA’s commitment to the development of indigenous shipping remains as firm as ever. “In this view, we have our hands on the pulse of every significant area of the industry from ship registration to the disposal of spent or scrapped ships and development of capacity for the acquisition of new tonnage, marine environment and management, maritime labour regulation, among others,” Fashakin said.
