Nearly 50 people have died in wildfires burning in the Attica region around Athens, in Greece’s worst fire crisis in more than a decade. According to the local mayor, 26 bodies were found in a yard in the seaside village of Mati, which is at the centre of the disaster. The fire brigade confirmed an overall death toll of 49, with many of the dead believed to be young children. The BBC reports that many calls have been made to the rescue services looking for missing persons. As part of a huge rescue effort, emergency workers used boats and helicopters to evacuate a beach. A search-and-rescue operation is being conducted for 10 tourists who fled one of the fires in a boat. Hundreds of firefighters are battling the blazes and the authorities are seeking international assistance. “We will do whatever is humanly possible to control it,” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras told reporters. The village is located in the Rafina region which is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps.
