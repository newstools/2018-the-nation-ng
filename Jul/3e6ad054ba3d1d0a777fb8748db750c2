Nigeria international Kelechi Nwakali has boasted that he will feature in every game the Super Eagles will play beginning with the September 7 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers against Seychelles at home till the country lifts the 2022 World Cup slated to hold in Qatar. Disclosing this to his fans on his Instagram page yesterday afternoon, Nwakali stated that he is nursing no ill-feeling over being dropped from Nigeria’s World Cup team to the ongoing Russia 2018 World Cup competition, insisting that, ‘‘Na so God want am to be. I will play every game the Super Eagles would play henceforth until the Qatar 2022 World Cup finals.’’ Nwakali used the platform to deny joining Dutch side NAC Breda FC in Holland, pointing out that he was in Portugal, preparing for the new season in Europe. Nwakali revealed further that he would begin training with Porto on Monday, although he was reluctant to confirm if he had signed a new deal with the Portuguese side. But the funny side of Nwakali came to the fore when one of his fans admired his army camouflage attire, when he said, ‘‘I like wearing army camouflage but I drop all of them whenever I’m coming to Nigeria. I don’t like to look for trouble.’’ When prodded why he wouldn’t wear camouflage attires while in Nigeria, Nwakali said, ‘‘I no wan look for trouble. I no want any beating from anyone because I know my boundary. I no wan soldier to beat me. I know say na dem cloth be that, so when I dey Portugal, I dey wear my camouflage from cap down to shoes or even slippers. But not when I am in Nigeria,’’ Nwakali added.
