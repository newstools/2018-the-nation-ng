The Catholic bishop of Awka Diocese, Most Rev. Paulinus Ezeokafor has commended the Anambra State government over the ban on commercial motorcycle operation in Onitsha and Awka, saying the proscription has restored sanity to the once noisy cities. He said the ban has also lessened the noise pollution occasioned by the frequent movements of the motorcyclists in both cities. Speaking on Friday at St. Peter’s Catholic Church, Nkwelle, Awka during the burial of Noble Lady Juliana Chinwe Okika, mother of Rev. Fr. Emmanuel Kenechukwu Okika, the cleric however expressed reservations on the timing of the notice. Ezeokafor who hinted that he was away when the ban notice was issued, noted that more time would have been given to the operators to enable them negotiate for their next line of business. “I came in to behold a serene environment. I can now sleep and wake up anytime I like without any form of disturbance. The operators move around anytime without recourse to people’s health or quiet time. “You know it is not easy to change a business, I learnt that some of them do not even know how to drive buses or shuttles. Government should please consider time when next they embark on directive like this. “I’m glad that the government through Anambra State Small Business Agency (ASBA) has provided an alternative means to cushion the effect on the affected persons. Now that the decision has been reached let the affected persons leverage on this initiative,” he said. The Catholic Prelate also expressed satisfaction at the orderly manner the ban was implemented and enforced as well as the total compliance witnessed so far on the side of the operators.
