Senate President, Dr Bukola Saraki has finally announced his exit from the All Progressives Congress (APC). Saraki announced his decision in a Tweet on his Twitter handle @bukolasaraki on Tuesday evening. The tweet read: “I wish to inform Nigerians that, after extensive consultations, I have decided to take my leave of the All Progressives Congress (APC).” He did not indicate the party he is moving to, though there have been speculations of his plan to defect back to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Ten  Senators last week defected from the APC to the PDP, while two others joined African Democratic Congress (ADC). Saraki’s final exit might have been hasten by the dissolution of the Kwars State executive of the APC at all levels on Monday by the National Working Committee of the party (NWC). The NWC asked a caretaker committee led by Hon. Bashir Bolarinwa to run the party pending the election of new leaders. Caretaker committees will be appointed at the ward and local government levels. The dissolved state executive committee, which is loyal to Senate President Bukola Saraki, is led by Alhaji Ishola Balogun-Fulani, who has been openly castigating the party along with other leaders in the state. It was learnt that the decision was taken because of alleged disloyalty by the Balogun-Fulani led APC executive. It was also gathered that the step became necessary to prevent Saraki from “hijacking” the party’s candidates who will be elected at the primaries of APC.
