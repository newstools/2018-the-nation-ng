The Presidency on Friday night denied the stories claiming that Pastor Tunde Bakare of Latter Rain Assembly and Minister of Finance, Mrs Kemi Adeosun, met together with President Muhammadu Buhari at State House, Abuja. According to a statement by the Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Femi Adesina, the stories are far from the truth. On arrival at the State House after the jumaat prayer, Bakare and Adeosun had walked together moving towards the President’s office. But the statement said that the Minister was at the Presidential Villa in connection with the Annual General Meeting and 25th Anniversary Celebration of African Export-Import Bank (AFREXIMBANK) holding Saturday in Abuja, which would be graced by President Buhari. It added “She ran into Pastor Bakare, who was on a scheduled visit to see the President, and they exchanged pleasantries. “The cleric particularly thanked the Minister for finding time to attend his mother’s funeral, which took place in Abeokuta, Ogun State, penultimate weekend. “Mrs Adeosun had seen President Buhari not fewer than three times earlier in the week, and did not need to meet with him again on Friday. “This statement is to put events in proper perspective, and dispel all conjectures and fictive reporting.” it stated
