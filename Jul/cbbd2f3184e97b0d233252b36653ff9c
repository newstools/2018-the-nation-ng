Lagos State Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal yesterday warned landlords and vehicle owners to shun renting their property to drug peddlers or face arrest. Edgal spoke during an interactive session with security stakeholders in Area “E” Command, Festac Town. According to him, property owners who accommodate drug peddlers will be prosecuted as collaborators. The police chief said he was bent on flushing drug peddlers out of Lagos State. Edgal said his drive to eradicate the use of illicit drugs was premised on the fact that easy access to narcotics and weapons was responsible for the insecurity in the land. The police chief warned hotels selling alcoholic beverages to underage persons as well as those housing teenage prostitutes to desist or face closure of their premises and revocation of licences. He said: “The major problem we are having in crime today is cultism and drug proliferation, especially among youths, which has become a scourge. “It has become so bad that in every 10 young persons, four are involved in cultism and drug abuse. “The fight against drug abuse should be a collective one. Join the police and other law enforcement agencies to eradicate drug peddlers from our communities. A situation where these peddlers now go to primary and secondary schools to sell these illicit substances to our children should not be condoned. We cannot continue this way. “We must fight all these social vices that make our communities unsafe. Henceforth, we will arrest owners of buildings where drugs are sold. Owners of vehicles containing drugs would be prosecuted. “The country is currently battling several security challenges because of easy access to drugs and weapons.”
