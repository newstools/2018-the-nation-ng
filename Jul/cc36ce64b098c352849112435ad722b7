Lionel Messi has been pictured on the sea. The 31-year-old was pictured on the sea while on holiday with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo, their three children and Daniella Semaan, the partner of his former Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas. The Barcelona superstar is putting his Argentinian World Cup disappointment behind him with a bit of paddle-boarding this summer. There was plenty of talk after the South Americans were sent packing by France in the round of 16 out in Russia that Messi would announce his retirement from La Albiceleste. But he is forgetting all about footie for now as he holidays with stunning wife Antonella Roccuzzo.  The five-time Ballon d’Or winner was previously spotted enjoying some downtime in Formentera, the smallest Balearic Island which is reachable by boat from Ibiza. Messi is expected to link back up with the Barcelona squad by the end of the month, when he will be joined by Spain stars Gerard Pique, Jordi Alba and Sergio Busquets. Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde gave all four players permission to take a month off after the World Cup, though they have the option to return beforehand. When the Spanish domestic season resumes next month, Messi will be the unrivalled star of La Liga following Cristiano Ronaldo’s £100million move to Juventus. For the best part of a decade, Messi and Ronaldo’s rivalry defined football but the Portuguese has now left Real Madrid for the Serie A giants. Argentina supporters are hoping Russia 2018 was not the last time Messi plays in the blue-and-white shirt at a World Cup, but he will be 35 by the time Qatar 2022 starts.
