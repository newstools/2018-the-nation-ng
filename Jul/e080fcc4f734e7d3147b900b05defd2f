In a statement by his Special Adviser on Media and publicity, Femi Adesina, the President joined the government and people of Abia State, the Abia Traditional Council, family and friends of the royal father to mark the milestone, which also marks his 19th year on the throne of his fathers. He noted that Isi Ala I of Isieketa, as a custodian of the people’s culture, had upheld and promoted the values of communal living with wisdom and dignity, while always mobilising his domain for community development and civic duties. President Buhari also hailed Eze Nmerengwa’s deep sense of patriotism by regularly advocating for harmonious co-existence in the country, especially in welcoming and accommodating non-indigenes in his domain, and his unwavering position on the unity of the country.
