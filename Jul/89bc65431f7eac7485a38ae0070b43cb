Motor parks in Ado-Ekiti on Friday became beehive of activity with eligible voters travelling out of the state Ekiti state capital to travel to their different homes to ‎cast their votes in the July 14 governorship election in the state. It was gathered it that the popular Ilesa Park, Old Garage Park, and Ikere park all located in Ado-Ekiti were filled with passengers, most of who are voters. Investigations showed that few buses were available to convey voters and other passengers as most of the buses had been booked by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). One of the commercial drivers, Mr. Omololu Gbenga who spoke to the media, a lot of people had been traveling to their ‎ homes to vote in the exercise as early as 8 a.m. He explained that the voters were traveling because most of them registered in their towns. “I have been travelling ‎to Oye, Efon and Aramoko since morning and most of my passengers are those clamouring to visit their towns to vote. “I pray this election is conducted free and fair because our people are suffering and we need to vote for the right leader,” he said. Another commercial driver, Mr. Omolade Tayo, said most of the passengers were interested in traveling to their towns to vote and collect money from some of the politicians. He said virtually all the motor parks in Ado-Ekiti had been busy ‎but that transport fare had not increased. Mr Ogundare Bisi, also a commercial driver, said he had more passengers traveling to their various towns to participate in the election either as observers or as an electorate. A passenger, Mrs Owolabi Folasade, who also spoke with NAN, said she decided to travel to her hometown to cast her vote for the governorship candidate of her choice. Other passengers said they decided to travel to their homes to participate in the exercise because they did not want to be disenfranchised. NAN
