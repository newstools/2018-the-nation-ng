Two members of a suspected robbery gang were killed on Monday in a gun duel with men of the Delta State Police Command on Odion Road in Warri. It was learnt that the gang, which had terrorised the Essi Layout axis of the town for a long time, was dispossessing some people of their belongings near Odion Junction. While the robbery was going on, the community vigilantes sent a distress call to the Divisional Police Officer (DPO) of the Warri ‘A’ Division police station, who alerted the police team on patrol in the area. Police spokesman Andrew Aniamaka, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), said the suspects opened fire on the approaching police operatives. He said: “It’s true. What really happened was that a distress call came through from the vigilantes around the area and our men on patrol headed towards the junction. On getting there, the hoodlums opened fire on our men, but we were lucky. They eventually brought two of the suspects down in the process. They died before they could be ferried to the hospital. “Exhibits recovered from the suspects included: AK-47 rifle, AK-47 magazine, Infinix and Nokia handsets. “The bodies of the suspects have been deposit at the morgue.” The Nation also gathered that some members of the robbery gang escaped with bullet wounds and were being trailed. An eyewitness said the suspects dispossessed victims, particularly girls, of their mobile phones and other valuables at 6.30 a.m.
