The Women at Risk International A non-governmental  organisation (NGO), Women at Risk International Foundation (WARIF), has been named a recipient of the grant of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in Nigeria. This grant will be awarded through the Pathfinder platform, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on reproductive health, family planning, HIV/AIDS prevention and care, and maternal health. The WARIF Centre, a sexual assault referral centre (SARC) run by the organisation, is the only private NGO that got the grant to cater for sexual abuses in Lagos. This grant will be implemented, through the WARIF SARC, as well as the other initiatives implemented by organisation – the WARIF Educational School Programme and the WARIF Know Your Community initiative. The objective of this grantor alliance  is to ensure that improved medical services, psychosocial counseling, associated services, and referrals to survivors of sexual assault are provided by the SARCs. It also aims to increase awareness of sexual and gender based violence through community-based intervention, contribute to breaking the culture of silence, and reduce the overall incidence of sexual assault in the country. WARIF founder Dr. Kemi DaSilva- Ibru, said: “We are very proud to receive this grant from the USAID in recognition of our work in making a positive impact in the lives of the many brave survivors we have been able to reach. This funding will ensure that we continue the good work so that more survivors of rape and sexual violence are able to have access to first respondent services, which we provide at the centre. ‘’In addition, we will be better equipped in managing cases of sexual assault, create greater awareness and train and educate more individuals on these issues and improve the reporting rate of gender-based violence in Lagos State.”
