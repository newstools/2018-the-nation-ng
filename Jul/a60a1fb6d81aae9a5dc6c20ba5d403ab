Investors have concluded transfer of about 16.75 per cent equity stakes in Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (Nahco) Plc, raisingÂ  possibility of changes in the shareholding structure of the ground handling company. Three deals were struck to complete major transfers that started with a cross deal on Thursday, bringing total transactions through the negotiated window of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) to 271.848 million shares valued at N1.787 billion in four deals. All the deals were cross deals and were consummated through the negotiated window of the Exchange. On Friday, a total of 119.92 million shares valued at N875.42 million were swapped at N7.30 per share. Also, a total of 5.62 million shares valued at N33.73 million were also crossed at N6 while another 22.69 million shares worth N136.134 million were exchanged in a deal at N6 per share. A deal had been struck for 123.64 million shares valued at N741.83 million at N6 per share on Thursday. As off-market, negotiated cross deals, it means that the deals were not subjected to the dynamics of price discovery for the particular period. Off-market trade implied that the deal was sealed outside the floor of the NSE. The negotiated cross deal platform of the Exchange is a special-purpose trading platform that is meant for voluminous transaction. By the cross deal, it implies that the buyer and the seller had been prearranged and the transfer at the stock market was a mere perfection of the agreement between the two. The negotiated cross deal allows the parties to the deal to close the deal at reduced cost.
