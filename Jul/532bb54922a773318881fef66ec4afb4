THE General Secretary of the National Union of Textile, Garment and Tailoring Workers of Nigeria, Comrade Issa Aremu, has asked the winner of the just-concluded governorship election in Ekiti State, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, to ensure inclusive governance to move Ekiti State and Nigeria forward. Aremu urged the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola, to accept the outcome of the election which was closely contested. He said the real victory in the Ekiti State election goes to the people of the state who, notwithstanding intense partisan campaign, “made wise choice” in an election globally adjudged to be transparent, free and fair. The General Secretary attributed the success achieved in Ekiti to what he called “the maturity and patriotism” of the electorate in the state. He recommended what he called the “Ekiti electorate patriotism” for voters in other states. The labour leader commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and other stakeholders, namely the contestants, political parties, security agents, union members, market women, students, traders, professional bodies, applicants and people from all walks of life, for the peaceful conduct of the election. He called on Dr. Fayemi to galvanize other contestants for the development of Ekiti, adding that the Governor-elect should “be less triumphant, by accommodating of all great people of Ekiti State, including those who contested against him”. The labour leader said the close contest makes it imperative on the winner to ensure inclusive governance to move Ekiti and Nigeria forward. Comrade Aremu also commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his commitment to democracy and rule of law, as evidenced by his seemingly non-interference in the electoral process and above all the guarantee of adequate security. He said this shows that democracy has come to stay in Nigeria.
