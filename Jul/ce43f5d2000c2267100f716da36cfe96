The World Bank has said that limited educational opportunities for girls cost countries between $15 trillion and $30 trillion in lost lifetime productivity and earnings. According to Missed Opportunities, a new World Bank report said less than two thirds of girls in low-income countries complete primary school, and only one in three girls completes lower secondary school. “ On average, women who have a secondary education are more likely to work and they earn almost twice as much as those with no education. Other positive effects of secondary school education for girls include a wide range of social and economic benefits for the girls themselves, their children and their communities. These include near-elimination of child marriage, lowering fertility rates by a third in countries with high population growth, and reducing child mortality and malnutrition,” the report said.
