Nigerian youths have been warned to guard against the use of hate speech, to avoid causing disaffection in the society. Malam Lamir Aminu, Chairman Electoral Committee, National Youth Council of Nigeria (NYCN), stated this in his goodwill message at the opening ceremony of the delegates’ conference in Gombe on Friday. Aminu said Nigerian youths need to understand and come to terms with ethnic and religious differences, for the continued development of  the country. “Religion and ethnic sentiments are the major stumbling block hindering the unity of Nigeria. “Let us do away with hate speech, eschew sentiments of religion and ethnicity, to make Nigeria a better place. He then called on the youth to ensure they are in possession of Permanent Voter Cards (PVC). “I am calling on those that have not registered, to endeavour to register,” he said. He also advised the youth to elect leaders based on merit not tribe or religion. The conference, tagged Unity Congress 2018, will also usher in a new executive council of NYCN. The national election will hold on July 21, in Gombe.  NAN
