A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Jigawa State, Alhaji Muritala Abubakar, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari, the newly elected National Chairman of the party, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to help uphold the democratic norms and principles of the party. Abubakar, who is the chairman of APC Internal Democracy Advocates (APC – IDA), in a statement called on the top leaders of the party to whittle down the negative effects of money in the selection and election of candidates, saying “We are at the brink where principled internal democracy is consistently sacrificed for money, by inducing the delegates so as to become the flag bearer of our party.” The group urged Oshiomhole to think of a more credible alternative to adopt in nominating candidates for election, saying the party’s constitution is flexible, as it provides different options like direct primary, where all card carrying and registered members of the party in a particular ward, local government or state will be involved in electing the most popular person. Abubakar added, “Our group is not oblivious of the fact that the direct means of election might be cumbersome but it will bring sanity, integrity and ensure transparency for the right and popular aspirant to emerge as candidate.”
