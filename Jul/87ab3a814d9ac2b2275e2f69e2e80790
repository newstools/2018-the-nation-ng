Kogi-bornphilanthropist Abdulrashid Musa Ujache has donated books and reading materials worth over N500,000 to seven colleges in various parts of Kogi State. Ujache said the gesture was part of his determination to contribute to the eradication of illiteracy among the youth. The seven beneficiary colleges areÂ  in Idah, Ibaji, Idah, Igalamela/Odolu and Ofu local government areas. Presenting the books to principals of the recipient schools, Ujache advised the students to shun vices and acts inimical to their education, adding that lack of education is the reason why most young people are involved in unwholesome acts. He described himself as a lover of education and appealed to them to imbibe the culture of reading in and outside school. Chairman of the occasion, Dr Yakubu Ugwolawo, thanked Ujache for the gesture. He called on others in positions of affluence to emulate Ujache in development of Igala communities. He advised the students not to involve themselves in any act that may have adverse effect on their studies. The Provost, College of Science and Technology, Idah, Dr Solomon Anyegwu, equally underscored the importance of education calling on the beneficiaries to be more committed to their studies.
