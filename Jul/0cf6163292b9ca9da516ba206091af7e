Nollywood actor Jim Iyke launched an app, ‘Oga Work’, to source artisans in Nigeria. A virtual application which provides users with the opportunity to source for artisans who can render any kind of service has been launched by Nollywood actor Jim Iyke. Reports say the app known as ‘Oga Work’ is especially designed for artisans who have a passion for their crafts but do not have a space or a store but crave for their services to be offered to end users. According to Jim, the innovative idea of the app is to solve the issue of unemployment in Nigeria. He said; “It is an app where one can get artisans to render any kind of services. The app is specially designed for artisans who have a passion for their crafts but do not have space or a store and needs one to take their service to end users”. The feisty actor also added that no matter what the skill involved, so far as it is legal, their job as the intermediary is to find an end user who needs the services of the artisan.
