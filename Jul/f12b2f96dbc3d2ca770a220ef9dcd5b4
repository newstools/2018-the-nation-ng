IT is yet another glorious honour for the founder of Quincy Herbals, Mrs. Quincy Olasumbo Ayodele, when she was befitted with Excellence Award in recognition of her contribution to the development of medicinal plant into medicinal herbs products and foods. The highly revered honour which was bestowed on her at the 13th Biennial Conference of Association of Lady Pharmacists [ALPS] was held in Abuja a couple of weeks ago also witnessed decoration of other prominent Nigerians. Also recognised on the day was Director-General of NAFDAC, Dr Mrs Moji Christiana Adeyeye, who also praised the association led by Head, Traditional Medicine Division, Federal Ministry of Health, Hajia Zainab Sheriff, for doing a great job. Encomium was showered on Ayodele for remaining consistent in promoting medicinal plant for over two decades.
