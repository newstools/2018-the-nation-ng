Lagos Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal has ordered the immediate release of 40 persons detained at the Federal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (FSARS) without cause. He also directed that 30 detained for alleged cultism related offences be charged to court without further delays. The police boss gave the directive during an unannounced visit to the unit stationed inside the Command Headquarters in Ikeja. Aside FSARS, Edgal, it was gathered visited five police divisions unannounced, where he interviewed suspects and inspected the stations. He warned his personnel to respect the rights of suspects and ensure they were treated with dignity, adding that he would continue unannounced night patrols of police formations under his command. It was gathered that the night patrols were also not unconnected to resurgence of militancy in some parts of the state and pockets of cultism related activities. Asked the reason for the patrol, Edgal said: “Patrols are a routine exercise in the force and we act according to directives from the Inspector-General of Police (IG), Ibrahim Idris. The IG said we should intensify efforts towards community and safety partnership.  That is exactly what we are doing.”
