President Muhammadu Buhari yesterday described the defections from the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the National Assembly as a seasonal occurrence on the eve of elections. He assured his party members that the defections would do no harm to the party at the elections. In a statement by his media adviser Garba Shehu, President Buhari while wishing the defectors the best in their future undertakings, expressed his total commitment to the values of democracy, freedom of choice and a total willingness to work with all members of the National Assembly, irrespective of their political party, for the benefit of the nation. The President said none of the defecting federal lawmakers of the APC had any specific grievance against him or the government he leads; neither did he harbour anything against any of them. The statement said: “As the saying goes, all politics is local. We understand that some of the distinguished and honourable lawmakers have issues with their home states, especially on zoning which bars some of them from seeking another term in their constituencies.” He commended the leadership of the APC for relentlessly working for its unity and ensuring success in the upcoming elections.
