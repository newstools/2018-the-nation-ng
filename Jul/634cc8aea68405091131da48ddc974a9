The Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) yesterday urged residents to henceforth desist from dumping waste or be prosecuted. In a statement by its Deputy Corps Marshal in charge of Operations and Monitoring, Ademola Kazeem, the agency said it had noted with dismay the resurgence of refuse in public areas over the past couple of weeks. Investigation carried out by LAGESC, he said, revealed that some residents have deliberately cultivated the habit of dumping waste on the road, sidewalks, road medians, and open spaces. He said some residents were still illegally patronising cart-pushers, who recklessly dump collected waste in unauthorized places. â€œThis deliberate act of sabotage which is targeted at undermining the efforts of the State Government on Cleaner Lagos is inimical to public health and safety especially in this period of heavy downpour in mainly flood-prone areas of the State.
