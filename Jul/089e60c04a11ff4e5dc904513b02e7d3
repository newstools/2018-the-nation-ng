•Celebrates 40th Anniversary Scib Nigeria & Company Limited has said it aims to be the number one broker in Africa. Its founder and Chairman, Olola Ogunlana, who stated this at the 40th Gala Anniversary in Lagos, said the firm is also targeting its expansion in Africa. He said the firm has produced top insurance professionals such as Leadway Assurance Limited Managing Director, Hassan Oye-Odukale; Consolidated Hallmark Insurance Managing Director,  Eddie Efekoha, and FBNInsurance Limited Managing Director, Val Ojumah. Ogunlana, who recently celebrated  his 80th birthday, said the company was built and nurtured on core values. He further disclosed that the firm is  building a magnificent corporate edifice in Lagos and engaging in intermediating insurance services through robust information and technology platforms. He noted that to inspire the company at its formation, he used the watchword from a nursery rhyme which had guided his life since 1938 when he was enrolled in St. Paul’s Breadfruit Primary School, Lagos. He said the simple, but inspiring rhyme provided the core value on which Scib Nigeria & Company Limited was built and nurtured. He appreciated the board, management and staff of the company for reaching the milestone. The firm’s Managing Director, Shola Tinubu, said the 40th anniversary afforded the firm a unique opportunity to give special recognition to the founder, stressing that the firm, which started with one employee, has grown to an employer of over 120 and has become a globally institution. He attributed the growth to the support from stakeholders, adding that it takes a lot to achieve the status of leadership the firm offers.
