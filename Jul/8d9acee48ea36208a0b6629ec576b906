The Nigerian Insurers Association (NIA) has urged insurance companies transacting oil and gas business that are yet to subscribe to the Energy & Allied Insurance Pool of Nigeria (EAIPN) to do so. NIA immediate past chairman, Eddie Efekoha, made the call while speaking with reporters in Lagos. He appealed to companies who participate in the pool to increase their patronage to improve the local market capacity to underwrite oil and gas risks through the pool. He said the pool was conceived by the association to build local capacity and reduce premium flight in oil and gas underwriting. He said: “Although the pool has its own technical management board, the association is impressed with reports of the significant progress been made so far as the balance sheet has continued to be impressive. Speaking on relationship with other government agencies, Efekoha said the association continues to engage strategically with stakeholders, such as Federal Ministry of Finance, National Assembly, Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRC), and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) whose activities impact on insurance business. ‘’The aim is to get them to fully understand insurance services to enable them assist us in delivering more value in the financial sector value chain through value enhancing policy frameworks,’’ he added.
