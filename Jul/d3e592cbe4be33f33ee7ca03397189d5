Wife of Ondo State governor, Mrs Betty Anyanwu-Akeredolu, has championed the cause of women venturing into agriculture to build the gender inequality in the sector. At the Babafunke Ajasin Memorial Hall in Akure during a stakeholders meeting, Mrs Akeredolu regretted that despite women’s more invest on the farm, compared to men, they still received the least gain. She said: “This is totally unacceptable, and we must make conscientious effort to ensure that women in agriculture gain what corresponds to the effort they put into farming. “Supporting women in agriculture is not only enough, we must also ensure the survival of our children. No one debates the fact that mothers are the primary care givers in the home. “When a woman in Agricultural sector is supported, she will, in addition to being economically empowered, raise well-nourished children. As we all know, malnourished children will be retarded in growth, unable to learn and be at the risk of many health challenges.”
