Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode, yesterday directed that the completed portions of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway from Eric Moore to Okokomaiko be opened to traffic as soon as possible. He asked the Public Works Corporation (PWC) to intensify palliative works on the road from Okokomaiko to Badagry. Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure, Ade Akinsanya, in a statement, said the governor was touched by motoristsâ€™ discomfort on the road. The governor also directed that palliative works be intensified along the Ajah-Badore corridor and other heavy traffic routes. Akinsanya said security and traffic agencies had been directed to dislodge road side traders and hawkers. Any law enforcement officer caught extorting money from motorists, he said, would also be arrested. He said the government was committed to even development of the state.
