Dana Air has emerged the Best Customer Friendly Domestic airline in 2018 at a summit and award ceremony organised by the Association of Foreign Airlines and Representatives in Nigeria (AFARN) in Lagos. Dana Air also pledged to support one of the recipients of the Integrity award who appealed for support at the event, as part of the airline’s strong commitment towards the well-being of Nigerians and encouraging honesty and integrity among not just aviation workers but Nigerians in general. Dana Air’s Media and Communications Manager, Kingsley Ezenwa, while receiving the award on behalf of the airline said: “Every frequent flyer in Nigeria knows that Dana Air is the best in terms of on-time departures, customer service and in-flight service, but I want to seize this opportunity to correct a wrong perception. Dana Air is owned by a Nigerian, born in Jos and had his primary and secondary education in Ibadan before proceeding to the UK for his higher education.’’ Speaking further to newsmen, Ezenwa  said, with a customer service department that works 24/7 and multiplicity of booking options available to our guests, capped with a reward programme that guarantees both flight-related and non-flight related benefits and rewards, we sure deserve the award.” ‘”And on behalf of the Management of Dana Air and our ever-committed and professional staff, we wish to thank AFARN for this award. We dedicate the award to our loyal guests who continue to fly the smartest way despite the recent efforts of some enemies of consistency and exceptional service.’’
