The General Superintendent of the Deeper Life Christian Ministry, (DCLM), Pastor William Kumuyi, has urged government and international agencies to collaborate with the church in solving youth unemployment. Kumuyi spoke yesterday at the church’s headquarters in Gbagada, Lagos during a certificate and award ceremony of the Skill Acquisition Programme (SAP) organised by the church’s Young Professionals Forum (YPF). Over 350 participants of SAP acquired skills in areas including urban and hydroponic farming, digital marketing, web design, mobile application, photography and video editing, event planning and interior design, pastry and mixology. Kumuyi, who was represented by DCLM Secretary, Pastor Jerry Asemota, noted that over half of Nigeria’s 182 million people were under 30 years and that according to the National Bureau of Statistics, the unemployment rate in the third quarters of 2017 was about 18.8%. “These are the most conservatives estimate. The figures could indeed be higher,” he noted Kumuyi said this motivated the church’s desire “to assist the teeming unfocused youths into self-discovery through God’s direction, which is leading us to support them in channelling their talents and mental resources into productive use. “The motivation for this pivotal professional training began in 2011 but formally commenced with the skill acquisition programme last month, which is a continuation of our desire to cultivate the total and an egalitarian display of the complete mankind whose entire faculties are carefully primed to show forth the praise of God”. Kumuyi added: “It remains our abiding desire to have them subsequently transformed from being employees to self-employed personalities and from employers to becoming entrepreneurs. Our unflagging desire is to reignite their spiritual lives to appropriate blessing from the arsenal of God’s grace”.
