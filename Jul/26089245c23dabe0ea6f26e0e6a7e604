Former Governor of Kano State, Malam Ibrahim Shekarau, has described the defection of Senator Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso from APC to PDP as a welcome development but urged him and his supporters to abide by the rules. Recall that Shekarau, a founding member of the APC had to leave the party for Kwankwaso in Kano when serving governors who dumped the PDP for the APC were asked to lead the party in their states. The former governor who spoke through his media aide, Sule Ya’u Sule, said he hoped Kwankwaso had changed. Many fear that those who defected to the PDP would have to fight for supremacy in their states where some chieftains had institutionalized themselves in the last three years. “I hope the PDP has received a reformed Kwankwaso. I hope it is not the old Kwankwaso I knew,” Shekarau said. “I hope he will this time around abide by the rules and regulations of the PDP. I hope he will not repeat what he did after he joined APC in 2015. At that time, he took over everything leaving us with empty hand,” he said. Shekarau regretted that the party they had laboured for at the end  handed over the leadership of the party to Kwankwaso in 2015. “I hope Kwankwaso is not coming to PDP to repeat the injustice he did in 2015. If everybody will be allowed to play his card according to rules of the party, that will be better for him (Kwankwaso) and every member of the party,” he said.
