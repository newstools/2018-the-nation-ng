 Promise they say is a debt.  While  it may not be easy for many to keep the promise especially if there is no law that compels you to keep it, some simply believe that it must be kept once you have declared it. An England supporter Dan Welch had declared way back in May even before the world cup kicked off on June 14 in Russia that he will have tattoo the England squad on himself if the team makes it to the quarterfinals.   He had tweeted “Putting my neck on the line, but if @England get to the quarter-finals with that squad, I will get the 23-man squad names tattooed on me.” Well the Three Lions made it to the quarterfinals and will take on Sweden in one of the quarterfinal ties Saturday at the Samara Arena. The Harry Kane captained team fought a nail biting battle against hard fighting Columbia to zoom into the quarterfinals. The team thus could be said to have done their part now it is time for super fan Dan Welch to keep his and indeed he has done it.  He did not only get the 23-man list tattooed on him he went a step further by adding the name of the coach Gareth Southgate. Some mothers you may want to say do have them but this certainly is a serious matter, a promise kept. Perhaps the next question you might want to ask is; what will he think of next, if the Three Lions overcome the challenges of Sweden to kiss the semi finals, and then what will follow if they make it to the finals. And now the big one, what happens if they repeat the feat achieved in 1966 when England won the world up? Time will tell as action continues in Russia. England crashed out in the round of 16 in South Africa in 2010 but were ousted in the Group stage in 2014 in Brazil.
