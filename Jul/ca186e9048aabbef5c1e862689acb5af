There is tension in Igbo-Eze North Local Government of Enugu State, following the abduction of a community leader, Chief Lawrence Chukwuemeka Eya, by suspected kidnappers. Eya, 68, was trailed to Kogi State where he was kidnapped two days ago. The development has thrown his Igbo-Eze North kinsmen into anxiety, especially as the abductors have placed N15 million ransom on him. His son, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) senatorial aspirant for Enugu North, Mr. Chinedu Eya, who confirmed the incident, begged the kidnappers to free him. Eya, who said political colouration might not be ruled out, added it was unhealthy for anybody to introduce brigandage into Enugu politics. “Right now, I really feel pain as a man. I cried, because the old man cannot be suffering. He put his life on the line for some of us to survive. Now that he should be benefiting, somebody is coming to intimidate him.”
