The national leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of doctoring the results of last Saturday’s governorship election in Ekiti State. Dr. Kayode Fayemi of the All Progressives Congress (APC) won the election, beating the PDP candidate, Prof Kolapo Olusola. In a statement on Wednesday by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan, the party said it reached the conclusion after a crucial meeting Tuesday night, where all the facts relating to the election were received and reviewed. “After a thorough examination of all hard facts, the NWC reconfirms that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) doctored the result of the election to favour the All Progressives Congress (APC)”, the party said. The party noted that apart from huge discrepancies between the actual votes cast at the polling centres and the results released by INEC, there were evidence that INEC pulled down the original result from its data base to accommodate the alterations. The statement continued, “The NWC also has evidence indicating that the original result was in favour of the PDP candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola-Eleka before the figures were altered. “The NWC, after very exhaustive examination of all facts reconfirms that the PDP candidate, Prof. Kolapo Olusola Eleka, clearly won the July 14, 2018 governorship election. “The NWC therefore calls on the leadership of INEC to immediately correct their results, apologise to the people of Ekiti state and be ready to admit their falsifications before the tribunal so as to return our mandate which was stolen at ‘gun point’ on July 14”.
