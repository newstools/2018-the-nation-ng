Governor Samuel Ortom has denied media reports that he plans to defect back to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). There has been rumour that he had concluded plans to leave the APC to pursue his second term governorship ambition on the platform of another party. But speaking to newsmen in the Government House, Makurdi, Ortom denied the media report, saying the dissolution of his cabinet is a continuous exercise to inject fresh people with new ideas. He added that the rumour that the exercise was targeted at particular persons was unfounded since even his closest aides have been removed from office. In a related development, the coordinator of “I stand with Ortom” group, Comrade Dan Nyikwagh, has commended Ortom for partially reshuffling his cabinet. He advised the governor to inject competent hands to help drive his vision for the development of Benue State.
