Prudential Zenith Life Insurance has launched a savings plan that allows customers to meet their long-term needs. The company recently launched a suite of new life insurance products, including My Savings Plan and My Family Protection Plan. The new products came on the heels of the recent launch of the company’s bancassurance business, which enables customers of Zenith Bank to buy life insurance products in more than 60 branches in Lagos State. According to the company, My Savings Plan is designed to help customers meet their long-term savings needs and My Family Protection Plan provides peace of mind to customers and their loved ones by paying a lump sum on the death of the policyholder. The new products are the latest development following the entry into Nigeria of Prudential Plc, one of the oldest and most capitalised life insurance companies in the world. Prudential Zenith stated that it aimed  to redefine the Nigerian insurance sector by providing a range of affordable life insurance products that are designed to meet the protection and savings needs of Nigerian consumers – and the new products are the first step in enabling Prudential Zenith to become a one stop shop for all Your insurance solutions. Prudential Plc, one of the oldest and most strongly capitalised life insurance companies in the world, last year acquired a majority stake in Zenith Life Assurance, to form, Prudential Zenith Life. Alongside its entry into Nigeria, Prudential also formed an exclusive Bancassurance partnership with Zenith Bank in Nigeria and Ghana.
