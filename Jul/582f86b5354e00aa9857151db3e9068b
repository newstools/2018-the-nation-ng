The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara state yesterday said it is awaiting Senate President Bukola Saraki’s directive on defection from the ruling party. State APC Chairman Ishola Balogun-Fulani told reporters in Ilorin, the Kwara state capital that members of the party remained committed to Saraki and would follow his decision. Balogun-Fulani described the APC as a broken party, saying the cord of unity among members had been severed due to internal wrangling and the “unwarranted” trial of the Senate President. When asked to respond to a call last week by the party’s three senatorial chairmen asking Saraki to lead them out of the APC. He said:”Everyone has a right to express what he wants but as for us, we wait on what our leader (Saraki) will decide ” Baligun- Fulani expressed relief, satisfaction and justification by the decision of the Supreme Court  acquitting Saraki of allegations of false asset declaration, pointing out that the party held the same position since the now ended trial began three years ago. “Like we have always maintained, no political party ever survived war waged against itself. Indeed, It is now clear that the bond of cohesion in the APC has been weakened, damaged, fractured and severed.
