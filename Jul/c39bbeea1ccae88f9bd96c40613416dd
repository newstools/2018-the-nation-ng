Italian club FC Crotone has upped their asking price for Nigerian striker Simeon Nwankwo from seven million Euros to 15 million Euros, SCORENigeria can exclusively reveal. Crotone, who will feature in Serie B in the coming season after they were relegated from the top flight this past campaign, were ready to let go their Nigeria goals machine for a princely seven million Euros before the World Cup in Russia. But after the big centre-forward made the final cut to Russia 2018 and even played a handful of minutes at the World Cup, Crotone have now doubled their valuation of the player. “Lazio were ready to pay seven million Euros for ‘Simy’ before the World Cup and it even looked like a deal would be sealed,” a top source told only SCORENigeria “However, since after the World Cup, Crotone are asking for 15 million Euros.” The 25-year-old Nwankwo scored seven goals in Serie A last season including a spectacular over-head effort against champions Juventus. He still has a year left on his contract with the modest Italian club.
