Twenty-three soldiers and eight trucks are said to be missing after Boko Haram insurgents ambushed a military convoy at Boboshe, Bama Local Government Area of Borno State on Saturday. It was gathered that the military, acting on intelligence, mobilised troops in a convoy of 11 trucks to clear the insurgents from the deserted village. The insurgents are believed to be those who escaped ongoing military offensives on the fringes of Sambisa Forest and Lake Chad region. A military source told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that only three of the 11 trucks returned to their base in Maiduguri. The source said: “There was a quick response by the Army when they received reports that hundreds of the insurgents gathered at Boboshe on the Maiduguri-Konduga-Bama road. “The soldiers were ambushed and only three of the 11 trucks returned to the base. It is not clear what happened but it was assumed the soldiers went missing.” Meanwhile, residents of Jilli in Gubio Local Government Area of Borno State have fled their community following an attack by Boko Haram insurgents. It was learnt that insurgents attacked the area from the Lake Chad axis. A resident, Malam Bukar Mustapha, told NAN that he and other villagers fled their homes when they received report that the insurgents were coming to attack them. He said: “On Saturday afternoon, we heard that the insurgents had gathered in the nearby bush preparing for the attack. “I am one of those who ran to Maiduguri, which is about 45 kilometres from my village. “On Sunday morning, I called Gubio and I was told that the insurgents attacked the town at night. I do not have the casualties because the situation is still not clear at Jilli.”
