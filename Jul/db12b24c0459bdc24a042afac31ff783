•Group holds safety training Lagos State House of Assembly has called on Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to restrict the movement of heavy duty vehicles to between 9pm and early hours of the day. In a motion, with reference to last week’s tanker explosion on Otedola link bridge on the Lagos-Ibadan-Expressway, Leader of the House, Sanai Agunbiade called for a review of issues surrounding trailers’ movement in the state. The House urged the governor to direct the Commissioner for Transportation Dipo Lawanson to ensure that long vehicles did not ply the roads until 9pm. It urged the government to sanction long vehicle owners who did not ensure that their vehicles were road worthy. The House called for regulations on the type of vehicles to ply Lagos roads to avert a recurrence of such incident. Speaker Mudashiru Obasa said: “Our traffic law should be reviewed to reduce loss of lives on our roads. If the Otedola Bridge incident had happened at night, the casualty would have been minimal.” He directed the Clerk of the House, Mr. Azeez Sanni, to write to the government on the matter. A group, Safety Advocacy Empowerment Foundation, will hold an intensive training tomorrow for professionals and emergency response teams to prevent a reoccurrence of the incident. The training, tagged: “Technical safety action session on tankers and articulated vehicles,” is being organised in collaboration with All Safety Professional Organisations, as part of efforts to ensure safe movement of flammable products. The event will hold at the Lagos Chamber of Commerce and industry in Alausa, Ikeja. According to the organisers, participants will learn modern techniques in fighting multiple fire and explosion.
