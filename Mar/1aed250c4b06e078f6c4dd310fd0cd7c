ANTHONY JOSHUA has a very strong chance of fighting unbeaten American Deontay Wilder in his next fight.  That’s according to the Brit’s promoter Eddie Hearn. Joshua will put his WBA and IBF titles on the line when he faces WBO heavyweight champion Joseph Parker in a unification bout on March 31. Both fighters are unbeaten but if Joshua manages to get past the tough Kiwi, Hearn has tipped Wilder to his (Joshua) next up. Speaking to Fight Hub TV, he said: “Our job is to give the public what they want, that’s how you keep boxing strong. “Anthony wants to do that, he wants to fight Deontay Wilder now – straight away. There is a very strong chance he will be next after Parker, an 80 per cent chance.” Wilder came close to losing in his last fight against Luis Ortiz but managed to pull through a tricky seventh round to win. And, as Hearn pointed out, Joshua has to beat Parker before any talk of a bout with the WBC champion can happen. “I think there’s a very good chance it could happen next, but we have to see on March 31,” he added. But, according to bookmakers Betfair, Joshua needn’t worry when taking on Parker. They see him as heavy favourite, pricing him up at 1/10 to win.
