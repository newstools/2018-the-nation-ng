The Chief of Staff to the Imo State Governor, Chief Uche Nwosu, on Saturday broke the silence on his governorship ambition, saying his father in-law will not dictate his actions as governor of the state. Nwosu dismissed the insinuation that he would be manipulated to do the biddings of Okorocha as another tool of blackmail employed by mischievous politicians who had been dislodged in the state. The governor’s aide argued that his ambition was propelled by the conviction that he has the capacity to sustain and drive the new Imo hallmarked by massive infrastructural development, free education, wealth creation, security of lives and property and accountability as well as the support of the people. Nwosu, whose ambition has been boosted by flurry of endorsements from across the state, maintained that “being the governor’s in-law is just an added advantage to my ambition,” stressing that he has garnered the leadership and administrative skills needed to govern a state like Imo. He said: “But people will be saying that we don’t want Uche Nwosu to be governor because he is Okorocha’s son in-law and if he becomes the governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha will manipulate him and tell him what to do. I tell you that if tomorrow they say Uche Nwosu is the governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha will not say let me give you list like other people do. “Of course being a son in-law to the governor does not stop me from doing what I am supposed to do as a Chief of Staff and a staff of the state government.”
