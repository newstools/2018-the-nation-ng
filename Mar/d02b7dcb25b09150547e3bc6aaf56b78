 Australian cricketers Steve Smith and David Warner will miss the lucrative India Premier League after they were handed a year ban for tampering with cricket ball. The disgraced duo were billed to captain the Rajastahan Royals and SunRisers Hyderabad respectively before stepping down in the wake of the controversy. The former captain and vice-captain were kicked off Australia’s tour of South Africa on Wednesday for cheating in the third Test last weekend. But on Wednesday IPL chiefs announced that they would not be allowed to compete in the most lucrative cricket league in the world while banned by their own cricket body. Smith and Warner were set to be among the highest earners in this year’s edition with contracts worth £1.3m. BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Chaudhary said: ‘I am not aware of the punishment as dished out by Cricket Australia but if they (Warner and Smith) are banned by their own cricket body then they won’t take part in the IPL.’ ‘The franchises will get replacements for the players as they (Warner and Smith) will not be allowed to play this year,’ Commissioner Rajiv Shukla added. ‘To be honest, I don’t understand what the entire cry is about. If the CA goes ahead and bans them, there is no way that the IPL franchises can accommodate them, just like Andre Russell had to skip the IPL after he was caught violating doping clauses. ‘If CA says that they have decided to ban the two players, that is where it all ends for them as far as IPL 11 is concerned. The IPL GC actually has no role,’ the official said. A statement confirmed: ‘The BCCI hopes that the cricketers participating in the IPL hold the highest regard for the Spirit of Cricket and Code of Conduct for Players and Match Officials.’
