Comic Nollywood actor, Victor Osuagwu has urged the Federal Government to reduce the level unemployment in the country by investing in agricultural. Osuagwu spoke at the African Farmers and Cultural Organisation (AFCO) event, tagged ‘Job Creation/Empowerment for Unemployed’ held last Friday at Zion Event Hall, Isolo, Lagos. According to him, Government should be more concerned on how to structure and expand the agricultural sector by granting loans to local farmers, stating that “hey should not neglect the farming the way they do to entertainment industry which has more than 10 million employees. They shouldn’t allow farmers to die in suffering.” The actor further implored Nigerians to embrace agriculture. “If you go to Europe, a lot of people are farming and that is why they don’t lack food. They have varieties of farm foods to eat but the case here in Nigeria is different. Everybody wants to work in a bank or Oil Company and the other areas are being neglected. So, I give kudos to AFCO empowerment initiative in partnership with federal government to improve agricultural production.” He also revealed his retirement plans, stating that he intends to relocate to his hometown so as to fully concentrate on farming. “I am preparing myself for retirement because there will be a time we all go to our various areas to go and relax, eat fresh foods and move away from the hustling and bustling of the urban city. I’m presently the President General of my Community. And I’m also a farmer,” he stated. He continued by saying that farmers never lack. “I’m planning to expand so as to start exporting outside Nigeria that is the reason I’m here today and I learned a lot from this programme. What I do now is that I give it out to people. I don’t buy bags of rice for people. Recall that Osuagwu got married to his wife, Roseline in style using a truck as parade instead of a luxury vehicle. The couple got married on December 8, 2012.
