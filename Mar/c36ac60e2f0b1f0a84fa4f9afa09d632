 With two past edition experiences of the Commonwealth Games in his kitty, hard fighting boxer Lukmon Lawal believes he stands a good chance of excelling at this year’s edition in Gold Coast Australia. The 2011 African Games silver medalist who is one of the eight-man boxing team listed for the Games next month, told NationSport  that he has picked up some experiences from his outings at the games while hoping that his third appearance would be rewarded with a medal. Specifically, he picked gold medal as his main target. “This is not my first time in the competition because I featured in the last two editions in India and Scotland. I was unlucky to have lost out in the two previous editions and this time around I am going there to reciprocate for my failure. I am eagerly looking forward to the tournament and I am in top shape for the fierce battle in Australia. There is no doubt that it is not going to be an easy ride to the podium but I cannot make same mistakes I made in Delhi and Glasgow,” he said. Lawal who will be competing in the men’s light heavyweight (81kg) is not giving up on making it to the podium in Australia. “Already I know what is at stake and I am going there to ensure I make name for myself and make my country proud. We have been training hard and we believe our efforts will be rewarded this time around. I hope to also inspire the younger ones at the games,” he added. Lawal represented Nigeria at the 2012 London Olympic Games and he was competed in the Men’s light heavyweight, but was defeated in the first round. He also competed in the same division at the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
