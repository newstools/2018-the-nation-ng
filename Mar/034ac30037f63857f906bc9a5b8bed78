The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) said it has intercepted 404.9 kg of cannabis sativa, popularly known as marijuana, in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Spokesman of the FCT Command of the NDLEA, Mr. Peter Adegbe, disclosed this in Abuja on Friday. He said seven suspects were arrested in connection with the substance which was seized between February 11 and 15. He said 127.9 kg of cannabis was intercepted in Abuja, while 173kg and another 104kg was seized in two separate incidents at Abaji on its way to the nation’s capital. The NDLEA spokesman said the suspects had been charged to court, adding that the agency is determined to make the FCT a no-go area for drug peddlers. “These merchants of death are advised to give up the business or continue to experience losses and a date in jail,” he said.
