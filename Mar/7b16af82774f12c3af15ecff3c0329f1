Imo State governor Rochas Okorocha, on Thursday called for the creation of the Ministry of Peace and Religious Affairs by the Federal Government to address the immediate needs of the people. Okorocha, who had created the Ministry of Happiness and Purpose Fulfillment in the state, said that the creation of the ministry would engender peaceful co-existence and check the growing threat of hate speech. The governor, who spoke when the Head of Service of the Federation (HoSF), Mrs. Winifred Oyo Ita led Heads of Service from the 36 States of the federation paid him a courtesy call at the Government House, Owerri, said “the nation requires the sacrifices of all, including the civil servants to remain strong and united.” He said: “The nation is also in dire need of all of us to show leadership at all levels. Again, negative comments discourage leaders. And time has come for the establishment of Federal Ministry of Peace and Religious Affairs. Ministries should be created to meet the immediate need of the people. With too much hate speeches, such ministry has become necessary.” Okorocha also called for the introduction of free education at all levels in the country, adding that the country can afford to run free and qualitative education if unnecessary wastes are curtailed. “The nation can also afford to run free education at all levels if we can reduce waste in all aspects of our nation’s life. Here in Imo, we have been known for education. Hence, the free education at all levels in the state. Here in Imo, we do not have bureaucracy. We don’t break the rules, but only bend the rules to achieve our goals. And that is the secret of the success we have in Imo. “It will take one year for anybody to tour our projects. We have built a new Imo. What we have now is a brand new Imo. Politicians have not painted us well because our style is different from the old system. The old names you used to hear in the politics of the State, you don’t hear about them again.”
