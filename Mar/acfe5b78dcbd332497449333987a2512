Mo Farah’s long-awaited duel with Usain Bolt has been confirmed, but not in the sport most of us were hoping. The athletics superstars will swap spikes for boots and go head-to-head in a charity football match at Old Trafford in June. Farah, who will play for England, cheekily told his Jamaican rival via Twitter: “Remember, it’s a marathon not a sprint”. Bolt will represent Soccer Aid World XI. The match (Soccer Aid for UNICEF) takes place just four days before the World Cup gets underway in Russia, with legends from sport and entertainment joining forces to raise money to help vulnerable children around the world. Farah and Bolt have previously discussed having an exhibition race over 600 metres, although it has yet to materialise. The British four-time Olympic champion ditched the track to pursue a career on the road this season, while eight-time Olympic gold medallist Bolt retired from athletics following the World Championships in London last summer.
