Some officials of the Edo State Command of the Nigeria Prisons are in trouble for beating and molesting officials of the state Public Works Volunteer Task Force (PUWOV) who allegedly dared to arrest one of their men. A viral video showed one of the PUWOV official identified as Eguagie Iyekekpolor being force to swim in mud water in front of the prison along Sapele Road in Benin City. It was gathered three PUWOV officials had intercepted an official of the Nigeria Prison Service for carrying passengers in front of Unity Bank along Airport Road. The PUWOV officials asked the prison official, who was with his wife, to drive to their office at the Urhokpota hall but he took them to the Nigeria Minimum prison along Sapele road. At the prison, other armed prison officials including policemen and soldiers, were said to have descended on the PUWOV officials and beat them up. Head of PUWOV, Kelly Okungbowa, said policemen attached to the Task Force pleaded with the prison officials to leave their boys but they refused. According to him: “The prison official was picking passengers in an unauthorised place and three of our boys intercepted him and they asked him to drive to our office so that we can impound it. “But the man took them his office along Sapele road where he and his colleagues beat up our boys. They asked one of them to swim inside mud water.” Edo State Government has said it would prosecute the prison officials harassing members of his Task Force. Secretary to the State Government, Barrister Osarodion Ogie, said Solicitor General of the state, Wole Iyamu, has been briefed about the case. Public Relations Officer of the NPS Edo Command, Aminu Suleiman, said the State Comptroller of Prisons, S. N Edoghutu has commenced investigations into the incident. Amina stated that a three-man committee was set-up to unravel those involved in the beating.
