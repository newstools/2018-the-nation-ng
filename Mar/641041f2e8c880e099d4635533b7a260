A 70-year-OLD man, Muyideen Alani, was yesterday arraigned at an Ota Magistrates’ Court in Ogun State for alleged manslaughter. Alani, of no fixed address, is facing a two-count charge of reckless driving, which resulted in the death of Mohammed Lawan. The prosecutor, Abdulkareem Mustapha, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on February 27, about 8:10 am, at Tempo Bus Stop, Obasanjo Farm, Ota. He alleged that the defendant recklessly drove a tipper, marked KTU 703 XV, on the highway, resulting in the death of 28-year-old Lawan. Mustapha said the offences contravened sections 5 and 13 (1) of the Federal Highway Act Cap 135, Revised Laws of Ogun State, 2006. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty. The Chief Magistrate, Mr. Matthew Akinyemi, granted him bail at N500,000 with two sureties. He said the sureties must live in the court’s jurisdiction and be employed. Akinyemi adjourned the case till May 3 for hearing.
