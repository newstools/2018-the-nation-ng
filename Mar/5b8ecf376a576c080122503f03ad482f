Imo State will administer measles vaccine on over 1.4 million children between nine months and five years, Health Commissioner Mrs. Angela Uwakwem has said. She spoke at the launch of the 2018 Measles Vaccination Campaign at Ideato South Local Government. It is organised by the Health Ministry in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), World Health Organisation (WHO) and other agencies. Uwakwem described measles as contagious and one of six childhood killer diseases. She said Nigeria had 13,893 suspected cases last year, adding that this explains the follow-up immunisation campaign. “This is one of the best strategies to reduce childhood mortality and morbidity from measles among children less than five years. “…Imo State will immunise over 1.4 million children of nine to 59 months,” Uwakwem said. She said the state was first in 2016, adding that there is need to retain the position. The commissioner said immunisation would hold in Orlu and Okigwe zones between March 8 and 13, and Owerri Zone between March 15 and 20. She hailed the state for releasing fund for the campaign and Governor Rochas Okorocha and his wife for supporting health care.
