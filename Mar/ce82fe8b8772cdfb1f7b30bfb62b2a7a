Benue State Governor Samuel Ortom has restated his commitment to the security of lives and property of Benue people. He spoke yesterday at the Catholic Youth Centre in Makurdi, during the dedication of Lutor Samuel Isho Adanyi, by the family of Chief Benjamin Adanyi, Majority Leader of the House of Assembly. Ortom said the need for ranching, as being championed by his administration, has recorded progress, especially with prominent Nigerians condemning the killings by Fulani herdsmen. He said God had heard the prayers of Benue people, and hoped that the displaced persons would soon return to their homes to continue with their normal activities. The governor also said salary problems would soon become a thing of the past, as regular payments had begun since the beginning of the year. He promised that money would be sourced and arrears cleared. Ortom also prayed that the child, who bears his same name with him, would grow in the fear and protection of God, and be successful in life. Adanyi thanked God for the baby, saying he returned Godâ€™s gift to Him with thanksgiving. In his sermon, Rev. Celestine Tyowua urged Christians to humble themselves and trust in God, and they would never be disappointed.
