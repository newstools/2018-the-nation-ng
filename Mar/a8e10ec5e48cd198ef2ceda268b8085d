The Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Pensions, Hon. Hassan Adamu Shekarau has said part of the loan approved for President Muhammadu Buhari by the National Assembly was meant for the payment of pensions, saying the delay in clearing outstanding pension liabilities was unfortunate. Shekarau who spoke at the commissioning of the national secretariat complex of the Nigeria Union of Pensioners (NUP) in Abuja said he has directed the Acting Director-General, National Pension Commission (PenCom) and the Executive Secretary of PTAD to engage the Ministers of Finance and National Planning as well as the Accountant-General of the Federation within two weeks to find out what is causing the delay in releasing the required money to pay the pension arrears. He said when the president sent a letter to the National Assembly seeking approval for a loan, he stated in the letter that part of the money was to be used to pay pension arrears, pointing out that the loan was approved for the government and therefore, there was no reason why the pension arrears should still be hanging. He said if after two weeks’ nothing is done, he was ready to move a motion on the floor of the House summoning the two ministers to appear before the House with explanation. He said the National Assembly was committed to the welfare of pensioners and has therefore constantly engage stakeholders in the industry to ensure that the needful is done. Also speaking, Executive Secretary of PTAD,  Sharon Ikeazor said the agency is working hard to clear the balance of the 33 percent pension arrears before the end of the year, while computing the data of pensioners who have so far been verified for inclusion into the pension data base.
