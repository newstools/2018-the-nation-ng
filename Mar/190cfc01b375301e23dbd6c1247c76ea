 The more miles women ride on their bikes the better their sex lives a new study has revealed. The new research, involving more than 3,100 women, should help to quell fears instilled in female cyclists after several small studies suggested a link between cycling and sexual and urinary dysfunction. Instead, researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, found that women who rode bicycles actually had better sexual function than other athletes that acted as controls for the study. Their improved sexual function came at a small price, however, as female cyclists were more likely to get bladder infections and saddle sores. ‘We found that lifetime miles ridden was associated with better sexual function,’ said lead study author UCSF medical student Thomas Gaither. As measured by the Female Sexual Function Index – a formal questionnaire that scores a woman’s sex drive and activity through questions about her arousal, orgasms and satisfaction – female cyclers were more highly sexually functioning than women who stayed off wheels. They were also less likely to report any sexual difficulties or dysfunction and did not show an increased risk of other urinary issues. ‘One of the more novel findings of the study is that lifetime miles ridden were directly correlated with saddle sores and urinary tract infections,’ Gaither said. ‘These findings may be considered by some as minor, however, saddle sores and infections may inhibit sexual activity. If we could find a way to prevent saddle sores and infections, we believe that cycling might improve the sexual health of women, he added. In the last several years, riding bicycles – especially stationary ones, in spin classes like those offered by the popular SoulCycle chain – has become an increasingly trendy way to get a workout for women.
