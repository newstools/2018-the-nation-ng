Residents of Ifako/Ijaiye have appealed to Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to stop the planned relocation of Iju motor park. According to President of Concerned Citizens of Ifako/Ijaiye Local Government Area, Chief Ayo Musibau, the plan to take over the park and push the yellow buses to Ward ‘C’ streets of Ifako/Ijaiye, which is mainly residential, would pose threats to residents. He told reporters that  letters and messages have been sent to the governor,  expressing their fears over the planned relocation of the park to a residential area and its dangers. Musibau noted that the  garage is in an ancient park located in a strategic area without an alternative size, adding ‘’when the government gave a contract to a company to build modern structures at the park, the people of Ifako/Ijaiye especially Ward ‘C’ which is the largest ward in the local government were happy and full of praises for the state and local governments, but after creating and building structures in the park that are almost nearing completion, the local government that is complaining of no money wants to demolish the structures.” The community appealed to the governor to stop the relocation of the park to avoid a breach of the peace.
