Abia State Governor Okezie Ikpeazu has said all the roads built by his administration are products of careful and thorough research. Ikpeazu, who spoke on the four-point programme of his administration – trade and commerce, agriculture, small and medium enterprises and technical education – said the government decided to build roads because of the noticeable gaps in road infrastructure. He said: “We have gaps in roads. It is not all kinds of roads, but those that lead to major economic hubs. We run a research-based government and all our projects, especially roads, are products of thorough research. “After a careful research, we resolved to build cement-based technology roads leading to most of our economic hubs and we are partnering with the Council of Registered Engineers in this direction.” The governor added that the roads were purpose-driven, of great economic significance, and were not based on friendship or political patronage. On education, Ikpeazu said his administration would fence the 312 schools in the state and power them with solar energy. According to him, the government was running a programme tagged “Education for Employment”, which had graduated 1,000 persons, out of which 170 would be absorbed into the local government system. He added that the government is targeting seven million palms and had in its nursery not less than three million.
