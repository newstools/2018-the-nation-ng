Veteran actor Richard Mofe Damijo, known as RMD has advised young people to ‘be intentional’ in any chosen career. Posting on his Instagram page, RMD wrote. ”Many times I’ve been asked what advice I have for young actors and lately I have come to realise that the best advice for anyone, irrespective of career path is to be intentional. “You do not wake up in the morning, have a bath, dress up nice and leave your house without an intention. You leave to either  go to work, school, church, market, just take a walk, see a movie, whatever… The point is you step out with an intention. Even if all you want to do is “waka round” without going anywhere in particular, that in itself is still an intention. This same theory must be applicable in your life, be intentional. Do not live your life without an intention. Don’t enter a relationship without an intention. Don’t start a business without an intention. Don’t pursue a career without an intention. “Draw up a long term plan and have a short term one that will help you achieve it, then work towards the plan intentionally. So if you need my advice, it would be these two words ‘Be intentional’.” After making his name as an actor, in 2008 served in Delta State, first as a Special Adviser to the state governor and later as Commissioner of Culture and Tourism. After his service with Delta State, he announced his return to the entertainment scene and reactivated his social media accounts.
