 Super Eagles manager, Genort Rohr is considering extending invitation to Swiss-born goalkeeper Sebastian Osigwe, according to reports. The 23-year-old SC Kriens star, who was born to a Nigerian father and a Swiss mother is currently enjoying a fine season in the 1. Liga Promotion in Switzerland, having kept six clean sheets in 17 appearances with his side on top of the table. Rohr is searching for a worthy first choice goalkeeper for the Super Eagles as Carl Ikeme is still in recovery following his battle with leukaemia. Ikechukwu Ezenwa, Daniel Akpeyi, Dele Alampasu and Francis Uzoho are jostling for the number one spot. According to SC Kriens official website, the former Switzerland U15,16 and 18 goalkeeper heard from the national team boss last month and their talks was positive. However, it wasnâ€™t clear if he will be handed a chance with the three-time African Champions for the upcoming friendlies against Poland and Serbia on March 23 and March 27 respectively but will be considered for future invitations. Sebastian narrowly missed out on representing Nigeria at U20 level after initially making the 30-man provisional squad for the 2013 World Cup in Turkey.
