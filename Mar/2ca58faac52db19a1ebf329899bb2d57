Former President Olusegun Obasanjo on Saturday urged leaders to work closely together to tackle the incessant clashes between farmers and herdsmen across the country. Obasanjo made the call on Saturday when he laid wreath at the grave site of 73 victims of herdsmen attack in Makurdi, Benue State. He said the continued violence and insurgency required collaboration and collective urgent attention, stressing that tackling security challenges must begin from the roots to secure permanent solution. He said until the problem is addressed from the roots more and more people would  be buried as victims. ”If the issue is tackled right from the roots there would be no room for assumptions. We must collectively find solutions,” the ex-President said. Obasanjo said he laid the wreath to sufficiently express his sorrow, empathy and sympathy to the families of the victims, the governor and people of the state and Nigerians. He said he had attended the Zero Hunger meeting which the state governor, Samuel Ortom, could not attend because of incessant attacks on his subjects by herdsmen. The former President said he was shocked to hear that after the mass burial of 73 persons, 83 more persons were killed in the state. NAN
