A Former Chairman of Senate Committee on Privatisation Otunba Ayo Arise has described himself as the best candidate for the governorship election in Ekiti State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The defector from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) said he will win the primary, adding that he is not intimidated by other aspirants, including former Governors Segun and Kayode Fayemi. He said the people would prefer a new person as governor, instead of former occupants of the seat. Arise said: “The APC needs a popular candidate,” adding that he has the requirements. Oni has  declared his intention to run for governor, but, Fayemi’s ambition is still in the realm of speculation. Arise spoke in Oye-Ekiti at a thanksgiving commemorating his release from kidnappers’ den at the  at SS, Peter and Paul Catholic Pro- Cathedral Church. He said: “The APC wants to win the coming election at all cost and they need a popular candidate and they knew I am the best for the job so that our strategy can work”. He said he will not step down for Oni and Fayemi, ahead of the primary. Arise said zoning is not applicable to a homogenous state like Ekiti, adding that, while Ekiti South is entitled to the slot by right like other zones, zoning cannot be the platform. He added: “The APC knew how important the July 14 governorship election is to members. They need to apply the right strategy and they knew  who is best fit to be able to defeat the PDP, and that is me. “Both Oni and Fayemi are my good friends. I contested as a senator when Oni vied for the governorship in 2007. The two of them have ruled Ekiti and now is my own turn. “Even, if I step down for any of them, I can only guarantee them my own vote at the primary because the delegates are adults who can  take decisions on their own”.
