 Debutant female boxers Yetunde Odunuga and Millicent Agbogbulem have declared their desire to make impressive impact in Australia despite hitting the big stage for the first time. Odunuga, who is an army officer specifically said she is not heading to the games to compete alone but to make her presence felt by mounting the podium at the end of the boxing event. “It is a dream come true for me making the eight-man boxing team because it has always been my dream to compete at big stage like the Commonwealth Games. I am just too super excited that I will be competing in my first Commonwealth Games for Nigeria. It was not a smooth ride to quality as it took rigorous training, hardwork and dedication under the watchful eyes of Tony Konyegwachie,” the 61kg boxer said. “I am not going to Gold Coast to respect other fighters and kiss the canvass but to make a point and also make a name for myself. I am confident that representing Nigeria at such a big tournament would spur me to aim high in the competition,” Odunuga added. For the 75kg Agbogbulem, nothing can stop her from making the medal zone in Australia. “Making the Commonwealth Games is a dream come true but it comes with it challenges. As a team, we are 100 per cent ready and must not be complacent as other teams have qualities. We just need to follow the instructions of our coaches and I can assure you that we can make Nigeria proud at the games because we have been working very hard under the leadership of the experienced technical crew,” she said.
