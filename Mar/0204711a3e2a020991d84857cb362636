The Nigerian Postal Service has launched its Electronic online Money Order Service at the ongoing 29th Enugu International Trade Fair, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports. NAN reports that the NIPOST Post-cash is the only medium through which participants at the fair send and receive money as there are no other banking services in the complex. NIPOST General Manager (Marketing Department) Irmiya Kylawe, said the service had been making brisk businesses sending and paying their customers at the fair. Kylawe said the process was an instant one stop shop of sending and receiving money across the country. He described the post-cash as efficient and reliable, adding that the patronage had been high since the fair began. The general manager said post-cash was one of the innovations and products introduced to revive NIPOST and make it competitive. “There are lots of services that we are rendering here through reinvention of our old products. You can see that participants at the fair have been paying and even receiving money by using our Point of Sales (POS). “This is the only banking service in the trade fair for now and it is serving them,” he said. Kylawe said that the innovations became necessary in order to attract people back to the products of NIPOST.
