At least six persons were feared killed in fresh but separate attacks in Bakin Kogi and Kaninkon chiefdom in Jama’a local government area of Kaduna State on Thursday. The killings occurred barely 24 hours after the state governor, Nasir El-Rufai, met with fulani leaders on lasting peace in the state. The two attacks which occurred at about 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. respectively were carried out by gunmen suspected to be herdsmen. A member of the security committee in the community, Auta Maurice, who confirmed the attacks in a telephone chat with our correspondent, said the gunmen, numbering about 10, wore army and mobile police uniforms. Maurice said three people were killed in the bush when they went to cut wood for roofing of their houses while three others were murdered at a local mining site on the hills. He said four injured people have been taken to hospital in Kafanchan. He said: “The attacks occurred in the bush at different locations and at different time.” “The first attack occurred at about 10:00 a.m. when some members of our community went to the bush to cut wood for roofing of their houses. “All of a sudden, the herdsmen opened fire at them and three people were killed while others managed to escape. “The second attack happened at about 11:00 a.m. at a local mining site. Three people were also killed there, while four others were injured. “The herdsmen wore army camouflage and mobile police uniforms.”
