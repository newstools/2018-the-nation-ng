Self-acclaimed Alpha male and Big Brother housemate, Teddy A has revealed why he puffs cigarettes during his stay in the house. In a diary session with Biggie, TeddyA revealed that cigarettes are his means of escape from the petty drama in the house. He also revealed he wasn’t down for the continued arguments and the general discontent amongst the housemates as he pleaded for more creative sessions to express himself. “I am not down for petty arguments. That’s the reason why I smoke. For me, it is a means of escape. It just calms me down.” He also stated that he saw fellow housemate, Tobi Bakre as a competition and admitted to feeling wrong vibes when around Miracle. “I feel Tobi usually put me up for eviction as I have done with him overtime. I see him as a competition. “He (Tobi) is one I can share a few drinks with and relate to, compared to Miracle who I feel wrong vibes with whenever he is around.” Teddy A expressed his desire to work with a producer while craving more productive studio sessions alongside Rico. “I look forward to having a producer around. I feel there is a little dose of creativity here and I want more studio time.” Meanwhile, Teddy A, alongside CeeC, BamBam, and Nina are the four housemates up for possible eviction this Sunday. The four had the highest nominations after Alex nominated Teddy A and BamBam; Anto nominated CeeC and BamBam; BamBam nominated CeeC and Nina; CeeC nominated BamBam and Teddy A; Khloe nominated CeeC and Alex; Lolu nominated Miracle and Nina; Miracle nominated CeeC and Lolu; Nina nominated Lolu and CeeC; Rico Swavey nominated CeeC and Teddy A; Teddy A nominated Miracle and Nina and Tobi nominated BamBam and Teddy A.
