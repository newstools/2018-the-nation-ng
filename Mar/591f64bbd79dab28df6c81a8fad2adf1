The Chief of Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has said the force will prioritise the welfare of its training instructors, and the provision of infrastructure at the Training Command in Kaduna State. Air Marshal Abubakar, who spoke yesterday when he visited the command, said the welfare of instructors and pilots was paramount to safeguarding assets of the force. According to him, the Training Command is very strategic to the Air Force, hence the reason for his operational visit to identify its challenges, with a view to addressing them. His words: “We have gone round and seen everything. What is important is to look at the resources available and try to address challenges affecting the welfare of personnel. We will also ensure that pilots are in the right frame of mind discharge their duties effectively. “Whatever we are doing in terms of airpower originates from this base. So, we want to see what is happening to the welfare of instructors in that training, water supply, electricity, and so on. “All these are very important because we want to graduate people who will be effective in the discharge of their responsibilities.” The Air Officer Commanding, Training Command, Air Vice Marshal Muhammed Idris, enumerated the challenges of the command to include inadequate accommodation, electricity, water and training instructors. He, however, praised the CAS for the special attention given to his command over the years, and appealed that more should be done to reduce the command’s challenges.
