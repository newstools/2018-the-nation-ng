Represented by his deputy, Dr. Oluranti Adebule, the governor said that his administration right from the inception believed in government of inclusion in which a level playing ground is provided for everyone including youths so as to contribute to the growth and development of the country. Describing the theme of the summit Making Nigeria Work- Synergy between Leadership and the New Generation as apt, the governor noted that the summit was relevant as it came when political activities towards next year’s general elections were gathering momentum.
