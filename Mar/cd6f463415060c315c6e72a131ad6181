Nigeria’s Waidi “Skoro” Usman, who is billed to make a second bid for the African Boxing Union featherweight title at GOtv Boxing Night 14, holding at the Indoor Sports Hall of the National Stadium on 14 April, has vowed to win the title. Skoro is billed to fight Kenya’s Michael “Shaka” Nyawade in the headline fight at the event. Speaking in Lagos yesterday, Skoro, who lost a bid for the title to Uganda’s Edward Kakembo in 2015, said he is happy to have the opportunity again and he is certain of victory. He blamed his loss to the Ugandan on a bout of malaria he said he suffered before the fight. “This time, it will be different. I lost to Kakembo because I was sick about a week to the fight and I did not fully recover. This time, I am as fit as a horse and Nywade will pay for my loss. The title cannot go to East Africa this time. It will be with me in Nigeria,” said Skoro. GOtv Boxing Night 14 will feature six other fights, including the West African Boxing Union (WABU) title fight between Rilwan “Baby Face” Babatunde and Djossou “Agoy” Basile of the Republic of Benin. Rilwan “Real One” Oladosu, winner of the best boxer award at GOtv Boxing Night 13, will take on Kazeem “Ijoba” Badmus in the national lightweight title fight. Also in action on the night is Oto “Joe Boy” Joseph, who takes on Prince “Lion” Nwoye in a national lightweight challenge bout. The event will equally see Abiodun “Finito” Afini square up with Razak “Hyena” Ramon in a national cruiserweight challenge bout, while Chukwuebuka “Wise King” Ezewudo will test his mettle when he faces Semiu Olapade. The seventh fight will between Sulaimon Adeosun and Majesty Maduka.
