Following the withdrawal of policemen attached to politicians and other VIPS by the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, the senator representing Kogi West in the upper legislative chamber, Dino Melaye, on Monday evening condemned the order, claiming he was the target of the IGP’s directive. He said on his twitter handle “withdrawal of police from VIP, I am the target. IGP wants to expose me so I can be killed. Having survived assassination attempt twice, I deserve police protection in a country where I’m a tax payer.”
