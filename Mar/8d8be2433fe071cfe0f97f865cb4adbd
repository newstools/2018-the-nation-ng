Niger State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has reiterated its commitment to zoning, saying that it is the strength of the chapter. It said it will zone the governorship slot to Niger North (Zone C), urging other zones to show understanding. The leader of the Niger North Senatorial District, Alhaji Yahaya Ability, spoke in Minna, the state capital, on the rotational policy. He noted that chieftains from  Zone A are warming up for the primary, adding that they can only contest after Zone C has completed eight years. He said zoning to Zone C was done to ensure fairness, justice, stability  and peaceful co-existence in the state. Ability added: “ Zoning was created by the PDP to ensure  justice, and fairness. It was copied from  the national leadership, which first adopted it before other parties started to copy it.” The party leader urged  other political parties in the state to maintain zoning so that unity and peace can reign. He said any aspirant from other zone, apart from Zone C, is on his own. Ability stressed: “Niger South benefited for eight years under the lateAbdulkadir Kure. It later shifted to Niger East, which also benefited under Dr. Babangida Aliyu. It shifted to Niger North and the PDP lost the election contested by Alhaji Umar Mohammed Nasko. But, the party will still sustain zoning.” The deputy governor, Alhaji Ahmed Mohammed Ketso, a chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC), also endorsed zoning, saying it is a formula for equity. He told reporters in  in Minna that ambitious politicians from other zones should wait till 2023.
