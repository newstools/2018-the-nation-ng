The  Enugu State government yesterday inaugurated a 13-day measles immunisation campaign, targeting 500,034 children between nine months and five years. Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, who was represented by his deputy, Mrs Cecelia Ezeilo,  said the campaign was part of the government’s commitment to prevent children from complications associated with measles and other infectious diseases. The governor said that the state was working with stakeholders to eradicate the disease on caregivers and parents to help their children by bringing them out for the immunisation. He urged health care givers to ensure that every child meant of the exercise is immunised. Commissioner for Health Dr Fintan Ekochin said the immunisation was for children within the age bracket, irrespective of their immunisation status. The commissioner said the government would achieve 97 per cent coverage during the exercise. Ekochin urged the media to give the campaign massive publicity to ensure that parents present their children for immunisation. Representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Onyiye Emefele, said that the measles vaccination prevented about 2,000 deaths among children of nine months to five years from 2000 to 2015. Emefele called on parents and caregivers to ensure that their children were immunised to eradicate measles in the state. Dangana Saidu, representing the National Primary Healthcare Development Agency, pledged continued support of the agency for the state government, in terms of vaccination and other materials, to ensure success of the exercise.
