A fire at a police station in the Venezuelan city of Valencia, in Carabobo State, has left 68 people dead, government officials said. The blaze reportedly started after prisoners set fire to mattresses in an attempt to break out on Wednesday, the BBC reports. Police used tear gas to disperse relatives who surrounded the station after news of the fire broke. Chief state prosecutor, Tarek Saab, said an investigation into what had happened would begin immediately. State official, Jesus Santander, said the situation had now been brought under control. He said the state of Carabobo was in mourning.
