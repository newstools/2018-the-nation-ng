Champions League: Liverpool 0-0 Porto (5-0 agg) Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson in a post match interview with BT Sport said, “We are through to the next round which is the most important thing – obviously we wanted to win – but we have to give credit to Porto because they played well. “This is the business end of the season. The next few months are very important for the team. We need to put performances in like we have been and the results will follow. “We couldn’t manage to break them down tonight but there’s a big game this weekend which we need to be ready for. “I got a dead leg at the end but I will be fine.” On whether he wants to face an English team in the quarter-final: “It doesn’t matter. They are all good teams at this stage. We will be ready for whoever. “We want to work hard and achieve big things. The attitude was brilliant tonight. Unfortunately we couldn’t break them [Porto] down but I can’t fault the lads – the attitude was brilliant.” Liverpool 0-0 Porto (5-0 agg) Remember Liverpool’s last game in the quarter-finals of the Champions League? It was a scorcher. Guus Hiddink’s Chelsea led 3-1 after the first leg at Anfield but the balance of the return fixture would tip throughout the 90 minutes. It ended 4-4 – with Frank Lampard, Didier Drogba and Xabi Alonso on the scoresheet. Chelsea went through to meet Barcelona in the semi-final with an aggregate victory of 7-5 and it proved to be a turning point in Liverpool’s European history as it has taken them almost a decade to reach this point again.
