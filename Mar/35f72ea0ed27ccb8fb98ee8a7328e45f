The Senate yesterday resolved to invite Minister of State for Aviation Senator Hadi Sirika to brief it on steps taken by his ministry to minimise air mishaps. Apart from Sirika, who is mandated to appear before the Senate in plenary, the upper chamber also invited heads of the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA), Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB) and every other relevant agency in the aviation industry to give a full briefing on the steps that have been taken to minimise human errors and avoid preventable air crashes. The resolution followed the adoption of a motion on: “The need to minimise the possibility of air mishaps and near fatalities in Nigeria,” sponsored by Senator Gbenga Ashafa (Lagos East) and eight others. All senators who contributed to the motion agreed that urgent steps should be taken to fix the aviation section in the interest of the flying public.
