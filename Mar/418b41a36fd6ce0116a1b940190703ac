The Lagos Water Corporation (LWC) has appointed children as water ambassadors. Its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Muminu Adekunle Badmus, who spoke at the corporation’s head office in Ijora, Lagos on the occasion of the World Water Day, said: “We have decided to bring in members of the Lagos State Children’s Parliament to act as water ambassadors for the corporation because children all over the world have been affected by water crisis. “As an agency of the government, we consider it imperative to ensure they come first in our efforts to solve this water crisis.” Represented by the Chief Operating Officer, Deji Johnson, Badmus, said the ambassadors were being groom for leadership positions. He said it was expected that they would act as its watchdog and alert it on issues that were water-related, “as this will help us in responding to residents’ complaints.” “Our ambassadors will explain to the public the reason we need to conserve water. They will convince people why it is necessary to pay water bills. They will give us feedback from our customers,” he said. The managing director hailed the Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for supporting the corporation to provide potable water for residents.
