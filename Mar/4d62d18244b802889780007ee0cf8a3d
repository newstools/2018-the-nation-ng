 A source in the community said a two year old boy and five others were shot dead in the over three decades old intractable dispute.  Umahi  directed all the warring communities to cease hostilities with immediate effect and directed security agencies to arrest anybody fomenting trouble in any of the communities immediately. The state government according to Mr Uzor, also directed local councils to make bye-laws to prohibit the sale or lease of land for the purposes of cattle grazing, ranching, animal movement exploration/prospecting, among others without first obtaining permission from the Council Chairman who in turn must obtain authorization power from the Governor of the State.  “Anybody who encroaches into the land acquired by the state government for purposes of development shall be committed to prison and such lands shall remain irrevocable. “Executive Council also directed that from henceforth, building of hotels, private schools, community sponsored schools, restaurants, hospitals, pharmacies and filling stations without EXCO approval are highly
prohibited. “All private schools in Ebonyi state must be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education, and all such schools not approved by the ministry must be closed down within one week from the date of this
briefing”, he said.
