The Ecological Fund Office (EFO) at the Presidency has complained of paucity of funds to address environmental challenges confronting the country. It said the Office received about 1.1 trillion requests from states, specifically for soil erosion and flood control, which did not include drought, desertification and coastal zone management, nor does it include pollution control. EFO Permanent Secretary, Dr. Habiba Lawal disclosed this in Abuja during an interactive session with reporters. Lawal, who called for the timely release of ecological funds by the Federal Government, urged states and local governments to apply their shares, rather than rely on the Federal Government. Lawal added that since 2015, no fund has been set aside for ecological programmes. She regrets that in this administration, no approval has been granted from the fund. “The greatest challenge we are facing is the dearth of funds. The country is faced with a lot of ecological issues with meagre funds to tackle them. Regrettably, what we noticed is that while one is being solved, another one is being created,” she explained. On projects completion and inauguration, Lawal revealed that outstanding completed projects would be inauguration in few weeks and handed-over to the various benefiting communities. She said the projects implemented since commencement of this administration would be presented to the Federal Executive Council (FEC). “Since the inception of this administration in May 2015, 88 projects were warded, 45 have been completed and 43 are still on-going. About 90 per cent are on soil erosion,” Lawal said. She however warned that if the entire problem were left to the Federal Government alone, less impact would be recorded.
