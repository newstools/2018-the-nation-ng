Rising Afro beats singer, Kingsley Okonkwo better known by his stage name Korrekt is of the opinion that people only care about sounds when listening to songs and pay little or no attention to lyrics. When asked if songs are more of sound power than lyrical content, he said, “Songs are more of lyrical content, but this days it is sad to say that people only listen to sounds and don’t care about the lyrical content.” The Lagos born, Ukraine-based musician who started doing music professionally in 2011 has over 15 singles and collaborations with top music acts like Sound Sultan, CDQ, Falz and May D. With his single ‘Sweetie Tomato’ featuring King Minji currently enjoying massive airplay, Korrekt has big surprises for his fans in 2018. Signed to Indomix Entertainment, Korrekt is certain that his sound is unique and can be compared to no other. “I do Afro Beats, and my music is unique, because my sound is different, and has a concept that drives my fans and audience, also my sound has RnB Afro vibe in it.”
