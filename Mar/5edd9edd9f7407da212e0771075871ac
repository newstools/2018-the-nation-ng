A couple of artistes and celebrities have joined hundreds of thousands of young people in the United States for the ‘March for Our Lives’ protest which is currently rocking the nation’s capital. The event calling for government action to curb gun violence was organized by high school students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, where a gunman killed 17 people on Valentine’s Day. Singer Andra Day kicked off a string of powerful performances with her anthem “Rise Up.” Joining her on stage were students from Baltimore’s Cardinal Shehan School. Day also teamed up with rapper Common for her song “Stand Up for Something.” Other celebrities who took part in the event were Demi Lovato, Miley Cyrus, Ariana Grande and Jennifer Hudson. Demi Lovato also performed ‘Skyscraper’ during the ‘March for Our Lives’ rally in support of gun control in Washington D.C. George Clooney and his wife, humanitarian lawyer Amal Clooney, were among the many stars who took to the streets of D.C. in solidarity of the protest. The couple also made a $500,000 donation in the name of their twin children in support of the movement. In a statement to ABC News before the event, Clooney wrote, “Amal and I are so inspired by the courage and eloquence of these young men and women from Stoneman Douglas High School. Our family will be there on March 24 to stand side by side with this incredible generation of young people from all over the country.” Singer Miley Cyrus tweeted about marching with “heroines” in the U.S. capital. “Surrounded by heroines! Lucky to be here at this moment in history with the ones I love! #MarchForOurLives,” Cyrus wrote. Kim Kardashian West also joined in the action in D.C. with husband Kanye West and daughter North, tweeting, “I hope North remembers this forever.”
