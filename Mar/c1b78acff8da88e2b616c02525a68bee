The Zamfara State Commissioner for Commerce, Industries and Investment, Ahmed Maradun, has blamed security agencies for the worsening security situation in the state. Maradun spoke when the Senate Ad Hoc Committee on Security Infrastructure visited Zamfara. A committee member said Maradun spoke when the committee visit the Emir of Maradun. Maradun said: “The Federal Government ordered these security agencies to protect the people. The governor, as the chief security officer, is also empowered to give them orders, but when they refuse to take such orders what should he do? “Let me go personal with you, there was a time the security agencies were told there would be an attack on one community but despite the tip off, none of them made attempts to counter that attack; so many people were killed. “Also, you would have learnt that the President ordered the deployment of some of them. If you must know, they are just there and their presence is not felt. Whenever you give them information about an attack, they always reply that they have not received any order and cannot act. In fact, I think there may be a deliberate plot by these security agencies to undermine the powers of the President. “Then again, they talk about not having personnel and equipment, but they have enough to deploy in Benue State because they have the loudest voice; they have enough to deploy in the Niger Delta because there is oil there? I don’t believe in that. “As far as I know, the state government is spending a lot on security. Then if you know you cannot guarantee the protection of life and property, why do you take our money and why do you continue to take it. “Why do they take our money if they cannot do anything? I think they should return our money.”
