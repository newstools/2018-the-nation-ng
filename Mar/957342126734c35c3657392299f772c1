An interest group in  the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State, ‘Ekiti Kete Good Citizens Association,’ has said it would support the emergence of a flag bearer through the consensus option. The body said the consensus option would mitigate the post-primary crisis in the party after the exercise. The party has 32 official aspirants vying for the governorship ticket, with others still secretly lobbying to plunge into the race. A chieftain of the party and president, Ekiti Kete Good Citizens’ Association, Hon Ayodeji Babatola,  paid a courtesy visit to the State Working Committee, led by the State Chairman, Chief Olajide Awe, at its secretariat in Ado Ekiti  on Monday. Babatola while addressing the leaders of the party, represented by its State Secretary, Hon. Paul Omotoso, advised that should the party fails to get a consensus candidate that it should conduct  a free, fair and credible primary for the party to be strong enough to defeat Governor Ayodele Fayose. He said the group has visited the state prison and Erelu Angela Adebayo Babies Home at Iyin Ekiti to donate to inmates as part of the ways to promote and propagate the ideal of good governance the APC was renowned for. “APC can’t afford to lose Ekiti, because that can affect President Muhammadu Buhari’s reelection bid. The PDP will have their candidate from the North and that will deplete the APC’s votes, but once the southwest is strong to be able to deliver, of which Ekiti is part of, the job will be easier . “We are ready to partner with the SWC to promote and  sell  our candidate and to manage the post primary crisis in our dear party provided the right things are done”, he said. Speaking earlier, the group’s Publicity Secretary, Mr Fatai Adeyemo and a chieftain of the body, Hon Femi Amogbonjaye, described APC as the only hope for Ekiti, saying Fayose has bastardised governance and reduced Ekiti people to mere street beggars in the name of stomach infrastructure.
