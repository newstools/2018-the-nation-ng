Alhaji Dalhatu Dogara, the Chief Fire Officer of Nasarawa State, has called on residents of the state to immediately call the service in case of any fire outbreaks. Dogara made the call in an interview with our correspondent on Friday in Lafia. He gave the numbers which members of the public should call during emergencies as: 08130652025, 07030158046 and 08039669127, respectively. He said that the service has embarked on a sensitisation exercise to educate members of the public on fire safety tips and it was yielding results. The Chief Fire Officer attributed the reduction in cases of fire outbreaks to the level of synergy the service has entered into with stakeholders by sensitising them on fire safety rules. Dogara urged Nigerians to put off all electronic appliances whenever they were leaving their homes or offices, in order to stem fire disasters.
 He said the call became imperative due to the attitude of some Nigerians who were careless about putting off electronic appliances, even when they are travelling to spend weeks. According to him, “this careless attitude by some people often resulted in avoidable fire disasters that claim people’s lives and property, worth several millions of naira. “Even if you are at home, there is no point putting on appliances that are  not being used at that particular point in time, in order to prevent fire outbreaks,” he added. Dogara explained that lack of access roads was one of the problems hindering the effectiveness of the service in responding to distress calls in the state. He also advised members of the public to adhere strictly to fire safety rules, in order to curtail the cases of fire incidents in the state. NAN
