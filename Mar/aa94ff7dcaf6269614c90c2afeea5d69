A tricycle rider, Babagana Mustapha, and five of his friends, were yesterday arraigned before an Igbosere Magistrates’ Court for allegedly assaulting a Beninoise cook and a policeman. According to the police, the men assaulted  Mickey Dauwo and Corporal Balogun Gideon after falsely accusing the cook of causing the disappearance of Mustapha’s genitals. Arraigned with Mustapha, 28, are Isa Hassan, 35; Kori Kambo 35; Alhaji Mustapha 40; Bulu Umar, 18; and Ismaila Babagana, 32. They are standing trial before Mrs A.M. Davis on a three-count charge of conspiracy, assault and breach of the peace. Prosecuting Sergeant Reuben Solomon alleged that the defendants committed the offence on March 14 at about 12:30pm on Saka Tinubu Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. The defendants, he said,  conducted themselves in a manner likely to cause a breach of the peace by raising a false alarm about missing genitals. He alleged that the false allegation was a ploy to attack the cook. Solomon said: “The first defendant approached the cook, Mickey Dauwo, a Benin Republic national to help him split a N100 note into N50 notes, claiming he needed it as change for his passenger. “Immediately after Dauwo obliged him, the first defendant raised the alarm that his manhood was missing. “When Dauwo protested his innocence, he asked Dauwo to follow him to a hospital, so that a doctor could check whether his manhood was intact. But, rather than a hospital, he led Dauwo to an uncompleted building where the five other defendants were waiting. They began attacking the cook with different weapons and caused him bodily harm. “Corporal Balogun Gideon was passing by and saw them. When he asked what was going on, they attacked him too and injured him on the face, with one of his eyes swollen.” The defendants pleaded not guilty. Magiatrate Davis granted the defendants N120,000 bail each with two sureties in the like sum. The case continues on March 28.
