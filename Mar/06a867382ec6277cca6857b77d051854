 There is heavy security in Damaturu, the state capital awaiting the arrival of the President and Commander –in – Chief of the Armed Forces of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari to Yobe State. A detachment of security personal including army, police , Civil Defense Corp have been  deployed to strategic locations of the city to quell any breach of law and order during the visit. The August 27 Stadium where the president is expected to land from an Air force helicopter enroute Maiduguri International Airport has been taken over security with Armored Personal Carrier Machines mounted at the front of the stadium. The entrance of the Yobe State Government House where the president is expected to meet with all stakeholders in the state is also under tight security as the stern looking security operatives subject vehicles and human beings under strict checks before gaining entrance into the government house. In another development, schools and commercial activities have been paralysed in Damaturu due to unfavourable security arrangements put in place. Though there was no official statement as to whether there was restriction of movement on the streets of Damaturu, instead, the Commissioner for Information in the State Albania Mala Musti had issued a statement calling on the people to come out emass to welcome the President.
