Vodacom Business Nigeria has stressed the need for kids  to be exposed early in life to  information communication technology (ICT). The firm which organised robotics training for 36 pupils of S.S. Peter & Paul Nursery and Primary School, Ikate, Elegushi, Lagos, said new trends such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are fast gaining global traction. Speaking on the occasion, its Senior Manager, Product Portfolio, Abu Etu, said: “As part of our commitment to empower the next generation in Nigeria through ICT, Vodacom believes that it is important to promote training for pupils at the primary level of education. This will prepare them from the early stages of their lives for the post-digital age, which will demand technical knowledge and skills.” Also speaking, the General Manager, Loving Gaze, Barbara Pepoli, said: “We are excited that our pupils had the opportunity to learn new things beyond the walls of the classroom.” Getting children interested in technology is very important for our school and this field trip is a great way to make technology come to life for our pupils.”
