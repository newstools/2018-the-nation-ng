Emmanuel Amuneke has said he hopes his Sudanese club Khartoum Al Watani will qualify for the championship playoffs on Monday. The former FC Barcelona winger said he is worried about his team’s poor show on home ground. “We have not been getting the kind of result we want at home. If not, by now we should have been top of the Sudanese League. But we must have to keep fighting. Our objective is to finish among the top bracket going into the playoffs,” he told SCORENigeria. The Sudanese Premier League will go on break after next week’s round of matches.
