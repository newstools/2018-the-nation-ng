The police have arrested a 42-year-old driver, Seyi Olowookere, for allegedly raping a 12-year-old boy. It was gathered that Olowookere lured the victim from the football field where he was playing with his friends to his 1 Alhaji Masha Street, Surulere, Lagos Mainland apartment last Saturday. The victim said: “I was playing football with my friends when Mr Seyi asked me to freestyle for him because I am a rapper. I rapped a few songs for him and he asked me to come with him that he will help me. ‘’When we got to his apartment, he removed his clothes and asked me to do same. And then from behind he inserted his manhood into my anus. He begged me to suck his breast, I said no. When he was done he pleaded with me not to tell anyone but when I got home I couldn’t keep it to myself so I told my parents, who got the police involved.” Police sources quoted Olowookere as saying “I promised to help him when I saw him playing and singing with his friends. I asked him to follow me that I will help him. I locked the door and asked the little boy to take off his clothes and kneel down after which I fixed my penis inside his anus from behind and the little boy wasn’t shouting. I have been doing this for a long time. I have done it with seven people including adults. I am not a ritualist. I am a native of Uso in Ondo state. I want the police to help me in this case. I am a driver; I was married with a child, but I’m separated from my wife.” It was gathered that the victim was taken to Mirabel Centre for treatment where it was confirmed that there was penetration. The case was reported at Surulere Police Division.  It was transferred to the Gender Unit, a department which specialises in investigating sexual molestation, abuse, and domestic violence. Police spokesman Chike Oti, a Superintendent,  said the suspect would be charged to court after investigation.
