The Deputy Speaker of the Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Godiya Akwashiki, has declared his interest to contest for the governor in next year’s election. He made his declaration in Lafia, the state capital, during his visit to at the All Progressives Congress (APC) secretariat. Akwashiki said he joined the race to consolidate on the gains of democracy achieved by Governor Tanko Al-Makura. He said: “We all know there must be a transfer of power by 2019 because our Constitution does not support a third term. So, I am here to declare my interest in contesting the 2019 governorship to consolidate on the achievements of Governor Al-Makura’s administration. “I am qualified and ready to go to the battle line in 2019. I have the support of my family, friends and lovers, who have given me the go ahead.” Akwashiki, however, appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the executive and legislative arms of government, stakeholders and the public to ensure a credible election. The APC Chairman, Philip Sheckwo, congratulated Akwashiki for declaring his intention, saying that only courageous, ambitious and determined politicians can aspire for governor. He said: “Today, we welcome you wholeheartedly because apart from being an important day, you are a very committed party member.”
