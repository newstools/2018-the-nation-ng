Rico reveals why he has continued to shake off eviction in the house. His reason while consoling a rather unhappy Alex was due to “positivity” and abiding by the “fruits of the spirit.” Alex who was unable to get over Leo and the love they shared in the past, sought solace from Rico Swavey, a housemate who was keen to share his secrets of success. “The reason why people vote for me is because I am always positive,” Rico said. “I see light in dark and see good in the bad. “Positive vibes is like magnet. Do not attract negative vibes. You are dealing with humans and not rice and beans, bolts or nuts.” Rico who went further to add biblical excerpts to his way of life, alluded the fruits of the spirit to why he was always cool, calm and collected. He explained that this path has brought him only peace and positivity and encouraged Alex to do same. “I focus on a good and positive mindset every time I wake up. Yes, there are times you lose balance but you ask for grace to carry on,” Rico added. Alex accepted and even practised the message in the end as she was seen happily interacting with other housemates and the trio of Miracle, TeddyA and Tobi while they played table tennis by the closet.
