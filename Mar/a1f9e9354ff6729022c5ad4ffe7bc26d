An Igbosere Magistrates’ Court has sentenced a Beninoise food vendor, Janet Kenu, to six years imprisonment for being an accessory to burglary. Magistrate A. T. Omoyele convicted her for being an accessory to the theft of jewellery worth N40 million,  $5,250 and £5,000 cash belonging to the complainant, Mr Ajisola Yomi. She sentenced Kenu to two years imprisonment each on three separate counts of accessory to burglary and accessory to stealing. But the court did not find him guilty of failure to prevent house breaking and stealing. The sentences, which were without an option of a fine, will run concurrently, meaning Kenu will spend two years in jail. Kenu, of Otodo Gbame community, near Lekki, Lagos, was arraigned last July 21 on four counts of accessory to burglary and stealing and “deliberate neglect to prevent the commission or completion of house breaking and stealing.” Prosecuting Sergeant Cyriacus Osuji said Kenu and her accomplices, who are at large, committed the  offences around midnight on March 10, 2016 at A19, NICON Town Estate, Lekki. He said Kenu’s accomplices burgled Yomi’s home while he was away and carted away his properties including jewellery and foreign currencies.
