Black Africa’s Richest Female Magnate, Folorunso Alakija has said women are not in fierce competition with the men. Alakija stated this during a visit to The Nation Headquarters  in Lagos on Thursday which coincided with the commemoration of the International Women’s Day. “We are not in competition with the men. Our project, Flourish Africa has come to encourage women to roll up their sleeves, propel and prosper women even in the workplace or whatever it is they choose to do. “God created the man to be the head of the family and the women to give the support that he needs. Therefore a man cannot do without the woman. They must cooperate and prosper,” Alakija stated. Alakija spoke on her online platform, Flourish Africa which she said is dedicated to supporting the women. “Flourish Africa came on board because of the need to support women. Women have come a long way and have cause to be downtrodden, ignored and underrated. “A lot has been going on in the lives of women, especially the African woman.Women have been brought up to bear children, however I believe there is more to women than just that,” she said.  Flourish Africa is expected to focus on five core areas which includes inspiration, career development, health, beauty, love and relationships.
