•TUC, CDHR, others join anti-LUC rally AN defiance of the police, lawyers yesterday staged their second protest against the Lagos State Land Use Charge (LUC). The protest took off from Tejuosho Market. It was billed to start from Ikeja, but the plan was changed because of President Muhammadu Buhari’s visit to the state, which ends today. The police, on Wednesday,  warned against the protest, saying it could disrupt the President’s visit. Led by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Ikeja Branch, the protesters, among them the Trade Union Congress (TUC) and Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), among others,   went through Ojuelegba, Ayilara, Itire Road, Agege Market and Pen Cinema Roundabout. Ikeja NBA Ikeja Chairman Adesina Ogunlana described the LUC as a “toxic tax’ designed to impoverish the people. He said the government was not the people’s  friend,  pointing out that “it has forgotten that the same people it is trying to kill voted it into office. “When they were asking for our votes, they promised us change, they promised cheap houses, cheap transportation. But today, they are sucking our blood. “Lagosians, don’t be deceived, shine your eyes, LUC would lead to inflation, increase in rent, increase in cost of transportation, increase in cost of food. “This is why we are encouraging people not to pay LUC. It must not be allowed to stay,” he said. Ogunlana described the protest as a continuation of the people’s sensitisation  against an “obnoxious tax regime“. He said lawyers would not rest until the people’s will  is done “because this is not what they promised us.” CDHR Chairman Malachy Ugwumadu said the group was  disposed to anything that would restore the dignity of Nigerians and not enslave them “The increase in LUC is not acceptable to Lagosians and Nigerians. It is oppressive. It will lead to inflation and impoverish the people,” he said.
