All Progressives Congress leaders in Ifako-Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos State have endorsed Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for a second term. The Chairman of the council,  Apostle Oloruntoba Oke, said the endorsement was based on Ambode’s grassroots policies and his all-nclusive programmes. Oke said the chairmen of the 20 local councils and  and 37 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs)  are rooting for the governor’s re-election bid. He said: “This is premised on the simple fact that Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has demonstrably distinguished himself as bastion of hope and beacon  of light for light for good governance, in less than three years in the saddle.” He said a vote for APC the governor is a vote for continuity, transparency, integrity, accountability and good governance. Oke urged party chieftains to collect their voters’ cards and mobilise for Ambode’s victory at the poll. He  called on Lagosians to re-elect Ambode, asssuring that he will not let them down. Oke added: “With a population close to 20 million, we should be able to show our appreciation to this amiable governor by giving him five million votes to ensure the continuation of his good works.” He said the people of the council will give 250,000 votes to the governor, adding that he has set up a mobilisation team, “Ambode Continuity Babes,” to swing into action. Oke said: I challenge you to summon a new spirit of loyalty, patriotism and responsibility where each of UA have resolved to pitch in and work harder to pursue the greater interest of the party.”
