Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr has reiterated that he would not rescind his decision to omit Lille goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama from Nigeria’s 2018 World Cup roster. Enyeama called time on his international career in October 2015 following a row with former Nigeria coach, Sunday Oliseh, but there were insinuations that he may go back on his decision and rejoin the national team. Enyeama’s inactivity for Ligue 1 strugglers Lille has counted against him and Rohr has kept faith with the goalkeepers he used during the World Cup qualifiers and November’s friendly against Argentina in his latest roster. ”He has problems in Lille. He is currently not playing and is only the number three at his side,” Rohr told Soccer Laduma. ”He wanted to switch clubs, but he didn’t find a new team. As a consequence, the question about Enyeama returning is not really up for debate.” Enyeama, 35, was part of Nigeria’s roster for the 2002, 2010 and 2014 World Cups. Enyimba’s Ikechukwu Ezenwa, Chippa United’s Daniel Akpeyi and Spanish-based Francis Uzoho are far ahead of other candidates as the three goalkeepers to be named in the squad for this summer’s football fiesta in Russia.
