Following the second leg match of Sporting club in the ETTU Champions League, Aruna Quadri will be the last member of the table tennis team to arrive for the 2018 Commonwealth Games holding in Gold Coast, Australia. Quadri, who is one of the key players in Sporting of Portugal, will be leading his team away to a Russian side in the second leg of the Champions League. Despite losing the first leg 0-3 to the defending champion, Sporting is hoping for an upset in Moscow when both sides clash on April 6. With this development, the Nigerian table tennis team will be without the star player as they begin campaign in the team event of the championship on April 5. However, England and Singapore have expressed their intention to topple Nigeria and India when the table tennis event serves off on April 5. England captain, Paul Drinkhall believes they are primed to dominate Nigeria and others in Gold Coast.  “We are going to Australia to show what we can do and we are aware of the quality of Nigeria, Singapore and India. We believe we can do our best this year and dominate the event,” he said.
