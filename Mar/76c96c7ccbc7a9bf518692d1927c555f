Captain Adedayo Awobokun, the technical director for Lagos State Squash Association, organisers of the just concluded Lagos International Squash Classics has stated that while he was delighted with the outcome of the Lagos International Squash Classic, he would like to see more active sponsorship from the public and private sectors.
Speaking with NationSport at the finals on Saturday, Awobokun said: “I want the government and other sectors to come together to sponsor more tournaments because Nigerian players need to take part in local events like this. The more money channelled into the sport, the more participation will increase.”
He also noted that with more participation in local and international tournaments, the players can only improve.
“The highest ranked Nigerian at this meet was in the 200 bracket, while the highest ranked foreign player was 63rd in the world, I noticed Nigerian players, especially those in the Under-19 cadre performed well in the first round as some of them defeated higher ranked opponents but fell to the superior prowess of their counterparts in the second round.
“This shows that they are still inexperienced and could only get more games under their belts if they attend more events, thus increasing their world rankings” He added
He also added that sponsoring the sport and its athletes should not be only about profit-making, but with proper development, it could brighten Nigeria’s medal prospects at international events like the Summer Olympics and Commonwealth Games and urged well-meaning Nigerians and lovers of Squash to support the game.
