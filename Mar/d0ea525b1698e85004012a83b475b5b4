Neymar Jr. has been ruled out for rest of season, and his appearance in Russia as the FIFA 2018 World Cup draws near is also in doubt. It has also been confirmed that he has been ruled out for the rest of the season due to his toe injury. The Brazilian superstar who picked up the injury in the Ligue 1 clash with Marseille on Sunday is definitely out of next Tuesday’s Champions League clash with Real Madrid. The Paris Saint-Germain’s £200m Brazil forward is due to have surgery on the broken metatarsal at the end of the week. The 26-year-old was carried off nine minutes from the end of his side’s 3-0 win over Marseille, and his father Neymar Sr said earlier on Wednesday it could be eight weeks before he plays again. The Brazil team doctor Dr. Rodrigo Lasmar has said it could be ‘three months’ before Neymar returns which means he may not be fit to play again until the start of June, a fortnight before the finals begin. PSG official statement on Neymar’s surgery reported by www.espn.com reads; “After an initial treatment period of three days inline with a strict medical protocol, a joint decision has been taken between the medical staffs of both Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazil national team. “In accordance with the player, it has been decided that Neymar Jr will undergo surgery in Brazil at the end of this week. “He will be operated on by Dr. Rodrigo Lasmar, accompanied by Professor Saillant, representing PSG.” The French giants are 3-1 down from the first leg in Madrid, and face Troyes in Ligue 1 this weekend.
