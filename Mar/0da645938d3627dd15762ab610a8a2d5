Residents of Emilajulo Okepata community in Ifo Local Government Area of Ogun State, on Thursday protested what they called four years of blackout in the community. The placard-carrying residents and members of the community development association expressed anger that they were served bills by officials of Ibadan Electricity Distribution Company (IBEDC) every month, without finding solution to the blackout. A resident, Hannah Akintobi accused the electricity company of hiring thugs to carry out forcible disconnection of electricity supply in the community. She said one of the thugs had stabbed a man with a screw driver when the man prevented them from disconnecting power supply to his apartment. Speaking during the rally, the chairman of Emilajulo Okepata Community Development Committee, Elder Ibrahim Fasola urged the state government to intervene in their plight. ” We are staging this protest because we have been suffering in silence in the last four years. We have taken necessary steps to make the electricity company consider our plight to no avail. ”We hardly enjoy electricity for eight hours in one month. Before, we used to experience load shedding once in a week, but that has since stopped for years now. ” This is the reason why we invited officials of IBEDC to this meeting cum rally, in order to let them know what we are going through.” A representative of the electricity company, Mr Abdul Bayo Isola said the company was ready to look into the plight of the residents and find solution to the power outage within the next four weeks.
