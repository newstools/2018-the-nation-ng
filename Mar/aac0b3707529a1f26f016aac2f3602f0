The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has charged President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately recover over N28 billion meant for the rehabilitation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the northeast. The party alleged that the said funds were stolen by members of the Presidency cabal and certain Interests in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement on Sunday by its National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, the opposition party said the Presidency and the APC are not being sincere with the IDPs by providing cover for those who have been frittering away billions of naira donated for the well-being of victims of insurgency. It further stated that the President cannot in all honesty claim not to be aware of reported sharp practices, involving billions of naira in the management of funds in the Presidential Initiative for the North East, since the issues came into public domain. â€œIndeed, the Presidency cannot, in any way imaginable, claim not to be aware of reports that sometime in August 2017, a cabinet minister and a high ranking Presidency official were alleged to have diverted N18 billion from the N48 billion approved by the National Assembly for the rehabilitation of millions of IDPs and rebuilding of six Northeast states ravaged by insurgency in the 2017 budget.
