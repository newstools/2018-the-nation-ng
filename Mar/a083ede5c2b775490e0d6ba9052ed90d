Torrents of prayers went up to God at Yaba College of Technology ( Yabatech ) Tuesday as Christian and Muslim faithful consecrated the College administration for a new season of glory. The invocation, held simultaneously at the Chapel of Christ our Redeemer and the Mosque, centred on the need for cleansing and invocation for a new season of glory, on the new Rector, Engineer Obafemi Omokungbe, the Registrar, Dr. S.O. Momodu and the entire College and Governing Council. The Rector, read from Psalm 30:1-4 preceding the exhortation by the Regional Overseer of the Mountain of  Fire, Lagos Island, Rev. Julius Okeneye who preached from 2 Chronicles 1:7 charged the new administration to seek God’s wisdom and understanding in the running of the College. “When the righteous rule, the people rejoice.” The preacher charged the Rector to continue to champion the people’s interest. “The overwhelming turn out at this occasion is evidence of your acceptance by the people, and it is all because of your disposition to defending the workers. Those things you disapproved in those years, it is time to put them right.” The congregation led by guest prayer warriors prayed in turn for the peace of the College, the state, the nation, and the new administration. Also at the Mosque, the Imams led by Alhaji Busari Olore thanked God for the dawn of a new season for the College; thanking God for the emergence of an old boy as Rector of the College for the first time in 70 years. The Imams prayed for the reign of peace and progress in the College throughout the administration of the Rector and the Registrar.
