Las Palmas star Oghenekaro Etebo underwent a fitness test yesterday morning ahead of today’s La Liga match at Deportivo de La Coruña. The Nigerian international was surprisingly named in Las Palmas 25-man provisional squad, along with Imoh Ezekiel, and was pictured entering the chartered plane that took the squad to Galicia on Thursday afternoon. Allnigeriasoccer.com understands that Etebo has not trained with the squad since last weekend’s home loss to Villarreal in which he was substituted at half-time after suffering discomfort in the quadriceps muscle. La Provincia says the first radiological tests on Thursday revealed that there was no breakage in the damaged area, and manager Jémez has stated that he will wait until the end of this morning’s session to see how he responds. Despite not being in tip-top condition, Etebo plans to report for international duty on Monday subject to a successful visa application and was at the Embassy in Madrid on Tuesday. The attacking midfielder will have to get clearance from the Super Eagles medical team before he is allowed to step out onto the Municipal Stadium Wroclaw for the friendly against Poland in a week’s time.
