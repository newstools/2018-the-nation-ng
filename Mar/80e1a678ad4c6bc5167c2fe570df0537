The leadership of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT), Delta State, is disturbed over the high turnover of retirees from both primary and secondary schools. Its Chairman, Titus Okotie, who spoke in Asaba, the state capital,  said last year over 3,000 teachers retired from the teaching service, while another 1,500 were expected to quit later in the year. He said the future looked bleak, urging the government to intervene and save the falling standards of education. He said the state government lacked the resources to recruit new teachers, recommending that the government convene a stakeholders’ meeting to adopt a strategic framework to provide manpower for schools. He said: “With about 17,000 teaching staff in primary schools and an estimated 12,000 in secondary schools, our fear is that with the figure that retired in 2017 and those likely to retire this year, our classrooms may become empty if something urgent is not done.” He said the government must take a look at the decisions reached   during the 2015 education summit convened by the government.
