The Lagos State Commissioner for Transportation, Mr. Ladi Lawanson, has called for a beneficial relationship between the academia and the government, especially in sustaining the Lagos Traffic Law. The commissioner made the call during a visit to his office by a delegation from the Department of the Urban and Regional Planning of University of Lagos, Akoka. “The government and the gown should work together to ensure that constant development and growth in all sectors of governance are regularly upgraded for the benefit of the citizenry,” he said to the group led by Prof Leke Oduwaye. While promising to explore the possibility of a collaboration in the training professionals in the ministry, Lawanson assured the academics of the state’s readiness to enlighten the citizenry on the need to obey traffic laws. He promised to work with the public towards inspiring their buy-in and, ultimately, involve them in the enforcement of the laws for the benefit and well-being of all. Earlier, Oduwaye congratulated the Commissioner on his appointment and promised a relationship between UNILAG’s Department of Urban and Regional Planning and the Transportation Ministry.
