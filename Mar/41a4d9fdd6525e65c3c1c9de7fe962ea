MTN and Twinpine have launched a new product to enhance marketing of products and services through the mobile phone. The product is capable of advertising products and services of MTN subscribers that leverage the opportunity created by the platform. It can only work through MTN lines. Unveiling the solution, representative of MTN, Shorafadeen Mohammed, said the app is a self-explanatory platform on which any subscriber can register on the website and start pushing averts to other users of the mobile network. He said MTN has 60 million subscribers, stressing that 50 million users are fully profiled with their locations, age, sex and others. He noted that the team has been able to customise languages for those that cannot understand English, especially those in the remote areas.
