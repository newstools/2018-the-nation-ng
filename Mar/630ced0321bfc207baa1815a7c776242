The police in Lagos State, on Friday, said they had arrested two suspected cultists, simply identified as Kanmi, ( also known as Father) and Alami Samuel. The spokesman of the command, SP Chike Oti confirmed the arrest to newsmen, stressing that they were nabbed on Thursday while trying to attack a rival gang member at Illasamaja area of Lagos. Oti said the first suspect was arrested based on credible intelligence report as he had been on a wanted list for long over many violent crimes, including cultism.
 He said the Commissioner of Police, Mr Imohimi Edgar, directed the Divisional Police Officer of Ilasamaja to bring to an end the reign of Kanmi the Father who had terrorised the Community for long. “His activities had become worse since he came back from the prison. At exactly 5:p.m. on Thursday, Kanmi arrived the community with his gang unknown to him that his rank had been infiltrated by the underground operatives of the Command. “The DPO and his team who were on standby for him and his gang, sighted the suspect at Hassan Street, Ilasamaja with two others of his criminal associates in a fight with a young man suspected to be a member of a rival confraternity. “He had lifted his machete to cut his rival before he was challenged by the police team. “He immediately took to his heels and was pursued and arrested by the police. “He was frisked and a locally made pistol loaded with two cartridges was recovered from him. “Also arrested was one Alami Samuel, 22, years an associate of Kanmi the Father,”Oti said. The spokesman warned all those who belonged to these clandestine societies to renounce their membership or be arrested and dealt with according to the law. NAN
