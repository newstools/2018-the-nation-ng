Against the backdrop of incessant attacks unleashed on farmers by herdsmen in Oyo State, the Deputy Governor of the state Otunba Moses Alake Adeyemo has appealed to farmers to go on with their farming activities, saying that the state government was leaving no stone unturned to ensure their safety. The Deputy Governor made the appeal on Monday while featuring on ‘Oro Oselu’,a political programme on a government owned radio station in Ibadan. He said, “The state government is regularly holding meetings with people of different tribes and religious belief with a view to ensuring peace. “In Oke Ogun, we have been living with herdsmen for many years, we have even intermarried. The farmers should not take laws into their own hands in the event herdsmen encroach on their farms. Such incident should be reported to the law enforcement agents for the law to take its course. “I can assure you that any herdsmen who encroach on farms will not go unpunished.” Otunba Adeyemo who contended that agriculture used to be the mainstay of the nations economy before the advent of oil called on the people of the state to show interest in agricultural practice, saying that the current administration was ready to support them with agricultural loans, inputs and farm implements. The Deputy Governor, however, expressed happiness that President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration had restored agriculture to its pride of place in the country, urging the youths to embrace agricultural practice. He equally called for amendment of the nation’s constitution with a view to assigning specific roles and duties to the deputy governors to enable members of the public to assess their performance.
