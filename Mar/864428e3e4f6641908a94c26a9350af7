An highly emotional Anto breaks down during a diary session. The once evicted housemate who was voted in last Sunday alongside Khloe, found it hard to keep it together in the diary room while conversing with Big Brother on the issue of Lolu. Earlier on, Lolu was trying to defend himself by clearing issues with Anto, telling her he chose her over his girlfriend outside of the house. This happened after Anto found out that Lolu has been sending secret messages to a lover outside the house and confided in Big Brother. She expressed her intentions of slapping him if they weren’t on a reality TV show. “Lolu has been sending secret messages to someone in the diary room. I would have slapped Lolu when I saw him. He knows a lot of things about me and I feel I was being led on,” Anto told Big Brother. Biggie who wanted to know Anto’s next step, asked her what she intends to do next. But Anto was done with the relationship. She told Biggie Lolu betrayed her trust. “I am trying my best to deal with it now. I will try my best to carry on and I don’t know if I can trust him. I naturally have trust issues.” Anto who struggled with tears couldn’t hide her disappointment towards finding more about Lolu in the real world. “Now I know he is obviously keeping something from me,” Anto added.
