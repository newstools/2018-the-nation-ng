Osun State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirant Chief Bola Olaniyi has promised to consolidate on the legacies of Governor Rauf Aregbesola, if elected as his successor. Olaniyi urged the people to vote for the APC to ensure that the on-going projects are completed. He said the state needed a dynamic leader capable of delivering on the mandate, noting that Aregbesola has taken governance to a greater height in Osun. The aspirant explained that his desire to serve Osun was a long time ambition, assuring that he would be committed to infrastructure development. He said: “My ambition right from time is to serve the people of Osun in governorship position. The state has passed through leaders who were self serving, but I believe that people like me could improve on what Aregbesola is doing. “Osun mostly consists of farmers who need someone who will provide the enabling environment for them to grow the economy, particularly at a time resources from the federal government are dwindling.
