The Executive Producer and Main Anchor of Property Square, a radio programme on real estate, Mr. Ambrose Igboke, has said the programme, which began transmission in February, has transformed real estate, redefining its concept in the process. Igboke said the show was not confined to construction but covered  the entire value chain of professionals that constitute the real estate sector. He explained that Property Square is an engaging and lively radio programme with the main objective to address the knowledge gap between stakeholders in the real estate sector and the vast majority of Nigerians. Igbokwe also assured that Property Square will deliver quality information, discussions, reports, profiles, and other issues in the real estate sector in Nigeria and beyond. “The uniqueness and strength of the programme is that it discusses everything real estate,” he added. Property Square, a 30-minute radio programme, is divided into four major segments, each, dealing with issues on safety, security and legal constituents of the sector as well as an interview segment which features the critical stakeholders in real estate. Igboke further revealed that  Property Square will ultimately emerge as the number one real estate programme on radio due to its versatility; where everything in real estate is discussed.
