 Bayern Munich jetted off to Turkey in style on Tuesday after decked in blacked-out suits ahead of their Champions League clash with Besiktas. The Bundesliga side take a commanding 5-0 lead from the first leg into Wednesday’s game against the Super Lig team. A brace from both Thomas Muller and Robert Lewandowski gave the Barvarians a comfortable advantage going into the second leg. And it showed as the reigning German champions looked cool and relaxed as they waited for their flight at Munich international airport on Tuesday morning. With their massive advantage from the first leg, Bayern look set to advance into the quarter-finals of the competition barring any miraculous comebacks from their Turkish opponents. Lewandowski’s two goals at the Allianz Arena from the first leg means he has now scored 16 goals in his last 16 Champions League games and will be Bayern’s main threat going forward. Despite their dominant lead, defender Niklas Sule insists that they won’t be getting ahead of themselves and that they are expecting a tough tie against Besiktas. ‘It goes without saying that 5-0 is a comfortable cushion, but we’re expecting an extraordinary atmosphere, and Besiktas have a good team,’ he told the club’s official website. ‘We saw that in the first 15 minutes of the first leg when the game was still 11 vs. 11. Nevertheless, we still want to win in Istanbul. We won’t let ourselves get carried away but simply play our game. ‘They’ll try to put us under pressure and win the game in front of their own fans. I’m really looking forward to the stadium, but I think we have enough experience in the team to not be overawed by that.’
