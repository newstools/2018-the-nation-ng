Liberian President, George Weah, on Monday urged President Muhammadu Buhari and Nigerians in general to give the Super Eagles all the necessary supports in other to win the 2018 World Cup in Russia. He made the remark after closed doors meeting with President Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. He said: “I think Nigerian team is a model, we all followed them. I have played with great Nigerian players, I played against them. Now you have a new generation, the fact that they qualified for the World Cup is a good thing for Nigeria. “But I hope that they will prepare very early because they are going to represent Africa and we will be there to watch them, for them to bring the trophy for the first time if it is possible. But I think the seriousness to go to World Cup is not to pay players to go, I want every African government to know, if you win the World Cup, it is a pride to Africa is not just to Nigeria. So we must do everything to ensure that the players are not stressed, make sure they concentrate and make sure their incentives are given to them to motivate them. “Some of the things you see at the World Cup, you will see an entire team go to represent a whole country and you will hear that one minister took the money, they did not pay these players and the players are causing problem. When players are going to camp is to relax and focus. And for them to be in camp they must have everything there for them not to worry. “Remember I played in the European setting, when we go to camp we have nothing to do. The only thing we have to do is to take a shower and prepare for the game, everything is laid down here and so you have no excuse. “So let the players not have excuse, support them and let them go and bring back that cup.” Noting that every government in Africa complains when it comes to sports, he thanked President Buhari for supporting the Super Eagles to qualify for the World Cup in Russia.
