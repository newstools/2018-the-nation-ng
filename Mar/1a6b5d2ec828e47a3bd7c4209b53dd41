The Edo State Government has said a new waste management scheme would be launched in April to monitor the activities of waste managers across the state. The state Commissioner for Environment and Sustainability, Hon. Reginald Okun, disclosed this in a chat with journalists in Benin City, the state capital. Okun said the new waste management scheme would ensure effective monitoring of activities of waste managers and ensure that the people are better served by the service providers. He noted that “waste managers in the state would be required to register with the state’s waste management board.” Warning that the state will no longer tolerate the practice where operators go about their activities without following the set guidelines, Okun said “with the new waste management scheme in place, before anyone goes about claiming to be a waste manager in the state, he or she must be certified by the state’s waste management board.” He said those who fail to register with the board would be considered as criminals and prosecuted, adding, “Those who also patronise these illegal waste managers would also be prosecuted. “Individuals and companies are also required to have waste managers in place for evacuation of wastes,” he added.
