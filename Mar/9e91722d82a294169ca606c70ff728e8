The Audu/Faleke Political Organisation in Kogi State has thanked President Muhammadu Buhari for appointing National leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, as head of the party’s National Reconciliation Committee. The group described the move as a step in the right direction and a life-saving measure. A statement by its spokesman, Alex Kadiri, said: “We believe that this development is not only a step in the right direction, but a life saving measure, especially at this time that our party is enmeshed in crisis. “As responsible and foundation members of the party, we are not averse to efforts geared towards its well-being. This accounts for why we made ourselves available before two previous similar committees, though the National Working Committee (NWC) failed to implement its findings. “Our enthusiasm for this party is dampened by the assumption by most Nigerians that the issue in Kogi APC is merely between Governor Yahaya Bello and Senator Dino Melaye. But we do not believe in Bello’s leadership style, which is divisive and destructive. “We do not doubt Tinubu’s efficiency and capability, and as such look forward to seeing him deploy his leadership wisdom into redirecting our party towards peace and progress, even as we prepare for the next elections. “We also thank him for accepting this nation-building assignment, and urge him to hasten the committee’s activities, and pay particular attention to Kogi State where the government is planting seeds of disunity, especially through its recent unlawful creation and funding of unknown parallel party executives.”
