Experience came in handy for Segun Toriola in his narrow 3-2 win over Algeria’s Sami Kherouf in the group stage of the ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup holding in Nairobi, Kenya. Toriola had the better of the early exchanges, but had to rely heavy on his experience when the Algerian threatened at some point in the game to win 3-2 to the admiration of the Kenyan fans. “I am yet to understand the atmosphere in Nairobi because the high altitude is really affecting the balls. You cannot stroke the ball because it can go out so you just have to be careful whenever you are playing your strokes. I must confess that it has not been easy for any player in this competition because the altitude is affecting the movement of the ball, so you have to play with caution,” he admitted. The seven-time Olympian, however, commended his opponent, saying, “I could remember he gave me a tough time in Morocco last year but I am sure he knows that he met a strong Toriola today. I was really for him.  I am sure any player that wins the competition will count himself lucky because the altitude has worked against us.” However, Edem Offiong was not lucky against Algeria’s Lynda Logrhaibi as the former African champion fell 3-2 to the North African. Offiong struggled throughout the game as she made several unforced errors to give the Algerian a 2-0 but the Nigerian rallied back to level at 2-2. In the fifth game, Offiong started well but could not sustain the momentum as she lost 3-2 to the Algerian. An excited Logrhaibi told NationSport after her victory, “I thought that beating Edem will be an impossible task for me because I have never beaten her in our previous meetings. But today, I was calm and relaxed because I had nothing to lose if she defeated me. “I was just playing and enjoying myself. So beating Edem today is like defeating Oshonaike or Meshref because she is one the best players in Africa. I am so happy because this will motivate me in this competition,” Logrhaibi said.
