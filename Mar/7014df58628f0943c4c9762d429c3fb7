The invocation, held simultaneously at the Chapel of Christ our Redeemer and the Mosque, centered on cleansing for the college and a new season of glory on the new Rector, Obafemi Omokungbe, the new Registrar, Dr Sikiru Momodu, Governing Council and the entire College. The Rector, read from Psalm 30:1-4 before the exhortation by the Regional Overseer of the Mountain of  Fire, Lagos Island, Rev. Julius Okeneye. Quoting 2 Chronicles 1:7, Okeneye charged the new administration to seek God’s wisdom and understanding in the running of the College. “When the righteous rule, the people rejoice. The overwhelming turn out at this occasion is evidence of your acceptance by the people, and it is all because of your disposition to defending the workers. Those things you disapproved in those years, it is time to put them right,” he said. The congregation led by guest prayer warriors prayed for the peace of the college, the state, the nation, and the new administration. Also at the Mosque, the Imams led by Alhaji Busari Olore thanked God for the new administration and the emergence of an old boy as Rector of the College for the first time in 70 years.
