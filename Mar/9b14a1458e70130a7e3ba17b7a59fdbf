The last Ibadan killing of a 30-year-old man, Kehinde Adeleke, took a new twist yesterday as witnesses alleged that a soldier attached to the Oyo State security outfit, Operation Burst, shot the victim and not the bar owner, Seyi Olusa. Kehinde’s twin, Taiwo, said Olusa grabbed a gun from a soldier and shot Kehinde after a disagreement at the car park of the Trans Amusement Park where the bar is located. But three witnesses, who are regular visitors to the bar, said Olusa was not at the park when the incident happened. Alli Akinoso said Olusa, being the victim’s friend, had no reason to kill him, adding that he could not have grabbed a gun from a soldier and return it after killing someone. Akinso said: “I was at the car park and witnessed the whole thing. Kehinde’s junior brother, Damola, was having a fight with someone over parking slot. I tried to talk to him but he did not listen. Then the soldier came and beat him with a stick. He fell and we offered him water but he rejected it. When Kehinde showed up, Demola stood up and approached the soldier violently. “I saw the siblings struggling with the soldier. That was when the shooting began; then Kehinde fell to the ground. I tried to resuscitate him but there was nothing I could do. Taiwo was not at the scene, he was at the bar, he only came after the shooting and I was the first person he saw. He attacked me and tore my clothes. I still have the clothes with the victim’s blood on it. “I saw him at the scene when the fight started, he was trying to mediate but left when the Operation Burst team came. The car park is about 100 meters to the bar. He was not there when the shot was released. It is difficult to snatch a rifle from a soldier and return it after using the same gun to kill someone.”
