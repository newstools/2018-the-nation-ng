Edo State Governor Godwin Obaseki has approved the promotion of teachers in primary schools. The exercise covers three years, from 2013 to 2015. Obaseki directed the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) to give letters to the teachers. Acting Chairperson of SUBEB Dr. Joan Osa Oviawe said: “The details of the promotion letters are being finalised. A list of the teachers will be sent to education secretaries in the Local Government Education Authorities (LGEAs), indicating teachers who have been promoted across the 18 local governments.” She added: “Clearing the backlog of promotion for teachers shows Governor Obaseki cares about the welfare and well-being of teachers. “The governor’s directive has demonstrated his commitment beyond mere rhetoric. He has continued to show support to provide a conducive environment for teaching and learning.” Noting that lifting the ban on the promotion of teachers in primary schools is significant, Oviawe, who is also the special adviser to the governor on Basic Education, said: “This will enable the government to achieve the objectives of Edo Basic Education Sector Transformation (Edo-BEST).”
