The good news now is that none of the past fatal air crashes have been witnessed under the current administration. But it almost recorded such experience in the past few weeks. One of Dana Air plane over shot the runway in Port Harcourt as it landed at the airport. No life was lost. Another Dana Air plane also had its door failing off while taxiing at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International airport, Abuja. Even though no life was also lost in the Abuja mishap, many Nigerians have wondered what would have befallen the passengers if the door had fallen off while the plane was in the air. Another good news was the step taken by the Federal Government last Wednesday to check plane crashes in the country. It ordered complete audit of Dana Air, which was involved in the recent mishaps in the country. The Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, said “A lot of quality time was spent discussing air safety. The government of Nigeria is very much concerned about safety and the life of Nigerians, this is following the recent air incidents. “Minor as they were because there were no fatalitie, the government did feel concern and the Minister did the report to the Council on steps that were taken following the last incident in Port Harcourt, Dana aircraft overshooting the runaway. As soon as that happened, a few seconds, a rescue team was there on the ground and few moments thereafter every passenger on board was evacuated. There was no harm to persons and this is something that should be celebrated. “Within 24 hours an official investigation had commenced because investigators arrived in Port Harcourt and began work.One week after that a preliminary report was prepared and it was about this that the Council was briefed. “Consequently as announced by the aviation authorities, the engineer and pilot of that particular aircraft got their licences suspended and beyond that the government has ordered a complete audit of Dana airlines in terms of personnel, operations, and technical capacity.” he said It is also noteworthy that Dana Air has welcomed the audit exercise. It is hoped that the measure taken by the government will really help to stop Dana Air plane crashes in the country. Also it is expected that the measure will help to make other airlines in the country be on their guide while maintaining the best flight practices and reaching at least the minimum international operational standard in aviation.
