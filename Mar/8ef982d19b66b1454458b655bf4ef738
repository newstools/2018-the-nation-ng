The Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, on Thursday reserved judgment in the Federal Government’s suit seeking to extradite Senator Buruji Kashamu to the United States. A three-man panel led by Justice Joseph Ikhegh reserved judgment after parties adopted their written addressees. Buruji, who since represents Ogun East in the Senate, is wanted by the U.S Government to stand trial for alleged importation of hard drugs into the country. The federal government’s appeal followed the judgment of Justice Ibrahim Buba of the Federal High Court, Lagos, and another by Justice Okon Abang of the court’s Abuja division, on the matter. Both judges dismissed the federal government’s bids to extradite the lawmaker.
