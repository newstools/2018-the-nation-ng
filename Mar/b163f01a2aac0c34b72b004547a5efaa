Quadri showed the quality of a professional that despite being down by 3-1, he fought well and restored parity at 3-3 to the admiration of the fans who started shouting his name. The seventh match saw the Egyptian racing to the lead from the start but as usual Quadri tried his best to catch up but Omar finished up to dethrone Quadri at 4-3 thus emerging the new African champion. Edem Offiong had to settle for third spot after beating Algeria’s Lynda Loghraibi 4-0 in the third place match. Egypt’s Dina Meshref retained her women’s title with a 4-1 win over Cameroun’s Sarah Hanffou. Speaking to NationSport after the match, Assar said: “It is unbelievable for me to win this tournament and it came at the right time I needed my confidence after starting the year not too well at the Hungarian Open and in the German Bundesliga. There has been a lot of pressure on me after moving to another club from my former club. “I think winning this will restore my confidence and I will be grateful to Werder Bremen for their support. I also think Aruna played very well and he deserved to win as well. This final is a good showcase for Africa and I am happy that we have such level of competition in Africa with quality players,” he added.
