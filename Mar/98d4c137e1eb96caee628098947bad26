Actions will get underway by 8;45pm for the pre World-Cup friendly match between the Super Eagles of Nigeria and The Eagles of Poland at Wroclaw. The Polish team, however, would be without Dortmund flamboyant wing back Lukasz Piszeck who is expecting a newborn baby with his wife as well as the defensive duo of Bartosz Bereszynski and Slawomir Peszko who are ruled out of the game due to injury. What the Coach said: Reacting to Mikel’s absence, the German tactician, Gernot Rohr said – ‘The only game we lost when the captain was not here was against South Africa in June, I hope that this time will be better. ‘But we need a leader and John Obi Mikel is our uncontested leader but it’ll be interesting to see how the other players can do without him. ‘Unfortunately, he had this problem with his work permit in China which means he can go out but not come back and it was a problem. ‘We’ve been playing like a team and we have other players who can take responsibility. We have a second captain, a third and a fourth captain, so, I think the team will be able to give a good answer and also play the game as we want.’
