A Reverend, Moses Emonena, has been arraigned before an Igbosere Chief Magistrates’ Court for allegedly defrauding his daughter’s suitor of  N11,750,000. Emonena of the Assembly of God Church, Warri, Delta State, was said to have obtained the cash from Samuel Oladele Fatai under the pretext of giving his daughter to him in marriage. But, the police alleged that the cleric gave his daughter to another after collecting Fatai’s money. Prosecuting Superintendent of Police   Henry Obiazi told Chief Magistrate Folashade Botoku that the offence contravenes Sections 411 and 314(3) of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015. Obiazi alleged that Emonena committed the offence between November 2016 and March 2017 at Egbeda, a Lagos suburb. Fatai, he said,  reported to the police that Emonena gave him stiff conditions when he approached the cleric about marrying his daughter. The complainant said he was shocked that after meeting the financial condition of N11,750,000.00, Emonena gave his daughter out to another man. Emonena pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Botoku granted him N1 million bail with two sureties in the like sum. The defendant will be in custody until he fulfils the bail conditions. The case continues on April 27.
