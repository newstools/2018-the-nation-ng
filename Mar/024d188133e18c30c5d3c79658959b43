Teams in the men’s and women’s Premier Basketball League are eager for action as some of them are beginning to wonder when the season will kick off. With FIBA backing one of the factions in the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBB) election imbroglio to supervise the game before a fresh election is conducted as stipulated in the recent letter sent by the World Basketball Governing body, many Premier League teams are yearning for the commencement of the league. One of the teams official told NationSport yesterday at the stadium that the wait was mentally-draining for players and officials who have continued to train despite not sure of when the league would commence. He said that they training and preparing the players with huge funds without knowing when the season would start is like ‘throwing money into the fire’.  “It is a difficult situation which we hope will get a solution soon. “A group has been given the nod to superintend over the game before a fresh election is conducted so the group should seize the initiative so that the players can get busy. Some of the teams have even stopped training because of the uncertainty surrounding the whole situation. It’s becoming big mess really and the players are the most affected,” the official stated. A player who called NationSport to inquire when the Premier League would start was disappointed when he got a negative response.  He lamented that the players were getting despondent over the issue and called on the factions with FIBA’s backing to swing into action. “Basketball is our source of livelihood and I believe the NBBF should do whatever it takes to hold the league. Also, if the league does not hold, we will likely not have teams that will represent the country in the continental championship,” the player added.
