Super Eagles manager, Gernot Rohr has hinted that Plateau United goalkeeper, Dele Ajiboye and Feirense starlet, Dele Alampasu will not be included on the 23-man roster for the 2018 World Cup. The German stated that Alampasu is inactive at his Portuguese club, while Ajiboye has not been selected in the latest squad because he was given the chance to displace Ikechukwu Ezenwa as the number one goalkeeper in the African Nations Championship team and could not do so. ”They already had their chance, remember that we invited Dele [Ajiboye]. Dele is number two in CHAN team and it’d be surprising that he is number one and Ezenwa will be number two in the Super Eagles,” Rohr was quoted as saying by Goal.com. ”Alampasu, unfortunately, is not playing. You cannot take a goalkeeper who is never playing. Uzoho made his debut for Nigeria against Argentina and did very well. He plays for the second team of La Coruna; we could see him [at the World Cup]. Ezenwa was injured but he is returning gradually and he’s played with the second team at his club already. We’ll see who will be the fittest.” Former U-17 World Cup winner Dele Alampasu has not played a league game in Portugal since April 30, 2017 when he went the full 90 minutes in Cesarense’s 3-0 loss at águeda.
