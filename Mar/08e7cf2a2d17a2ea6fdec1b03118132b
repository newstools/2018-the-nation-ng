He believes Cloud Nine Records will surely go places and he is set to take the music industry by storm. “It’s a brand that I have stylised and managed to curb from the genres of reggae and dancehall with an Afro-pop infusion. I came in contact with the C.E.O Cloud Nine Records way back in the University .We graduated from the University of Lagos,” he said. On his career, he stated that music is the only way he expresses himself comfortably. “As a child, I would take my pocket money just to get loads of CD mixtapes and any form of music that am hearing on the radio that’s hot. I always felt a need to get it so that I could listen to it. I would say my new single is market ready. I was challenged by a friend to do something different from my usual sounds and we came out with this very catchy groovy sound on a South African type of beat,” he adds.
