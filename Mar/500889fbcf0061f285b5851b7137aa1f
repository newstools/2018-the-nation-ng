The FCT administration has concluded arrangements to ensure that air and railway passengers enjoy facilities at the terminals. The FCT Minister Malam Muhammad Bello and his counterpart, the Minister of State, Aviation, Engr. Hadi Sirika made this disclosure while addressing the media after a joint inspection of the facilities today, Thursday, 08 March 2018. The FCT Minister used the occasion to conduct his aviation counterpart round the facilities. On his part, the Minister of State Aviation said, his Minister will work to ensure a temporary access for passengers arriving the airport or departing to the city upon arrival. This he said has become necessary in view of the need to meet up with the target required for the commencement of rail operation in a few weeks times. This, according to him, will resolve likely human and vehicular traffics in the airport. According to him, the temporary access will give time for officials of Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), and the FCT Administration to work together to harmonise issues affecting the formal concourse that is designed to link up the airport and railway terminals. Engr. Hadi Sirika commended the FCT Administration for its dedication to completion of the facility saying the railway would greatly enhance the outlook of the city and give a modern transport facility to its residents. He underscored the immense benefits that the light rails will provide to both the airport passengers and residents. Also speaking at the occasion, Malam Muhammad Musa Bello expressed delight with the seriousness with which the Aviation Ministry is taking up the aspect of providing a concourse between the railway and the airport.Â  He added that the entire project has been in fulfillment of the commitment of the FCT Administration to completing critical ongoing infrastructure projects.
