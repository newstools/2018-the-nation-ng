A governorship aspirant of Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN) in Ekiti State, Senator Bode Olowoporoku, has promised to spend out of his security vote to feed the people if elected in the July 14 poll. Olowoporoku regretted that a massive hunger is afflicting the people of Ekiti State which he said the ruling People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has failed to address. He spoke with reporters on Thursday in his hometown, Ilawe-Ekiti, headquarters of Ekiti Southwest Local Government Area, during a sensitization rally ahead of the governorship election. The former Minister of Science and Technology promised to immediately address hunger by distributing 100 bags of rice to each of the 177 wards in the state every month for four years. To address hunger on a long term, Olowoporoku promised to launch Agriculture Revolution which will enjoy a huge investment from government with the sole aim of firmly establishing commercial farming. The former Senate Committee Chairman on Agriculture said the commercial farming initiative would generate thousands of jobs, create cottage industries and generate revenue into government coffers. This, he said, are better ways to tackle hunger than “the three or four cups of rice given to people by Governor Ayo Fayose once in four years. Olowoporoku said: “What has he been using to win? Two or three cups of rice but now I man saying I will be giving them 100 bags of rice, every ward, every month. “Even if you are taking it from the central purse in seven years, is not up to what Fayose spent on his useless flyover to nowhere. “And this is the money you can get from the security vote and you use the money to feed the people because the state belongs to them.”
