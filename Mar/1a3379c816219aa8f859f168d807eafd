The Registrar and Chief Executive, Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria, (TRCN),  Professor Segun Ajiboye on Tuesday responded to the request made by the Liberian President, George Weah that his country needed over 6000 Nigerian teachers to kick start the education sector of Liberia. The Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria boss said that Nigeria can afford to give Liberia more than 6,000 qualified professional teachers. It would be recalled that during his visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, Liberian President George Weah had asked for 6000 or more teachers to jump start the education of the country. Ajiboye said the request for Nigerian Teachers to develop the educational sector of Liberia was a marker to the international recognition of the quality that a Nigerian Teacher is made of. Ajiboye who said the Council has registered 2million qualified and certified professional teachers, said only those certified by the Council shall be processed for such transnational request. While fielding questions from newsmen at the University of Ibadan on Tuesday, Ajiboye noted that the TRCN has a standing Memorandum of Understanding with the Directorate of Technical Aid Corps consequent upon which no Teacher can be sent out to teach without being qualified, registered and duly licensed by TRCN. Ajiboye who noted that TRCN has achieved in the area of Teacher information System (TIS), and School Monitoring Project in Six states added that it was heart-warming that Nigeria Teachers are valued internationally saying the Council will not rest on its oars to ensure that teachers become truly professional to improve their worth.
