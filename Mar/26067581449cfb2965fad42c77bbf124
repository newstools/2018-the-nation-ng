 *Hails Cadbury over Tom Tom deal FIFA Stakeholders Committee Member and 2nd Vice President Nigeria Football Federation, Shehu Dikko, has declared that the Glass House is building the super Eagles not only to shine at the World cup in Russia but to remain a reference point thereafter. He made the revelation in a chat with The Nation at the unveiling of Tom Tom as the official candy of the Super Eagles in Lagos. Nigeria according to him has become a major stakeholder in world football and as such must compliment her new status with a formidable team that can be reckoned with. “We are building a very big platform, a sustainable platform that will transcend the world cup and after that remain as a structure that will be on cruise control. The corporate world like Cadbury have seen what we are doing and have keyed into it in a partnership that will further consolidate on our dream for the game in Nigeria,” he enthused Dikko who is also Chairman of the League management Committee (LMC) described the Tom Tom deal as worthwhile and timely, adding that it will ginger the national team in their quest to make a mark in Russia. “It is a deal between two brands Tom Tom and Eagles both with unique selling point and we are optimistic it will yield positive result. We see Cadbury as partners in progress, “he said. On the possibility of Super Eagles going beyond the Group of 16 Dikko opined that the team stand a chance of winning just like the remaining 31 countries in contention in Russia. “The team is well prepared; we were the first to release our world cup program and have been following it to the letter and when you prepare well you stand a good chance. There are 32 teams in contention and none is going there for a party.  We want to go as far as possible and if we can win it why not? We should, “he added.
