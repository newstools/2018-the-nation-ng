A laboratory scientist, Mrs. Monica Okoro, has advised people to bathe twice daily during the dry season, to prevent heat-related diseases. Okoro, of the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Ituku/Ozalla, Enugu, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu that the effect of heat bringing out sweat, which was salt water, combined with atmospheric virus and bacteria, could cause skin-related diseases, such as dandruff, eczema and acne. She said after sometime, if the sweat was not washed away, it could lead to an infection that could cause sexual-related diseases, especially in women. “It is good for everyone to bathe twice daily, especially during the dry season. “Women should not miss it. Bathing should be part of their daily routine. “They (women) should ensure they wear clothes, especially underwear made with cotton materials and not nylon materials, to allow free flow of air,’’ Okoro said. She urged people to wash their hands and faces, to prevent eye itching caused by the bacteria that could come in contact with the eyes through sweat.
