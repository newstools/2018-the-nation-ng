The D’Tigress forward, Cecilia Okoye has said the Nigerian team needs to be well prepared and hungry for glory at the FIBA Women Basketball World Cup in Tenerife, Spain from September 22 to 30. The Nigerian team is drawn in Group B alongside Argentina, Australia and Turkey – countries that are better ranked than Nigeria. However, Okoye believes that the team’s target which is the same as every country should propel Nigeria to shock the world. “We will need to be well prepared and be hungry for the gold. The target of course will be the same as every country competing to win the World Cup and I hope we can shock the world if we get our acts together.” While stating that it will be difficult to rate the D’Tigress’ opponent at the moment, she, however, admitted that it would not be easy to come out tops in the group but expressed optimism in the team’s ability to qualify from the group. The 2017 Afrobasket winner told NationSport that she is preparing for the World Cup by making sure she gets the right preparation, push herself to be better everyday, changing the way she eats and what she eats.
