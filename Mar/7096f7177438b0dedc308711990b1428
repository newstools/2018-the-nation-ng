RISING musicians, Neo Phlames and Labosky, will be holding a concert on Easter Sunday, April 1, at The Establishment Lounge, Gowon Estate, Egbeda, Lagos. The show which is the brainchild of both independent artistes will hold from 5pm to 8pm. Tagged “My Hood Live Concert,” the artistes will be performing with their six-man band called the Skye Band, consisting of a drummer, lead guitarist, keyboardist, bass guitarist, and two back-up singers. According to the artistes, “we came up with idea to bring something different to our neighborhood, yes there had been shows here in this hood but we are taking it a notch higher by performing with a live band.” Labosky added; “I and Neo Phlames are not a duo. We are separate artistes with big dreams but we came together to pull this big concert. We are certain of a great turn out and we are positive about what we intend to deliver to the fans. It’s going to be fun as we also have surprise packages in stock.” Neo on the other hand said; “although it is a free show, we will be selling VVIP tickets to those who can afford it as a way of supporting us as up and coming artistes because as it is, we are bringing this up from our pockets to set a standard and also to inspire others to always make moves. There are lots of things you can do for yourself because it is your life.” The artistes revealed that so far they’ve been able to secure sponsorship from real estate company, Richlife Commercial and Logistics, as well as Snapit even though they are still looking for more.
