Vice President Yemi Osinbajo said on Friday the Federal Government is implementing a strategy that would provide solar energy in the nation’s universities. He said despite the sectoral challenges, the Federal Government would complete major projects that would improve the power sector in the country. He stated these while receiving a delegation from the African Development Bank (AfDB) led by the bank’s Vice President for Power, Energy, Climate Change and Green Growth Complex, Mr. Amadou Hott. Osinbajo noted that the Buhari administration, through various projects, is making more efforts to ensure improved power supply nationwide. One of such projects, according to the vice president, was the federal government’s Energising Education Programme (EEP), which is a key component of its Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and Power Sector Reform Programme (PSRP). The project, which is being carried out through the Rural Electrification Agency (REA) is expected to power Federal Universities and Teaching Hospitals with solar energy. Osinbajo said in a statement issued by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity,  Laolu Akande, nine federal universities and one teaching hospital would be included in the first phase of the project.
