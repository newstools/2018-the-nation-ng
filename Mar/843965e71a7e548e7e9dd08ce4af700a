If the diary session Tobi Bakare, current head of house had with Big Brother on Friday is anything to go by, then it means his love relationship with Cee-C (Cynthia Nwadiora) is over. Tobi revealed to Big Brother that he is not happy with the way things are going between him and Cee-C and so he feels that letting her be will be the best option. Cee-C had in a diary session last week told Big Brother that she likes Tobi, even wishing that both of them can be paired together again, but Tobi put her up for eviction last Monday, telling her later on that he did that “because it’s just a game.” It will be recalled that both of them were the first lovebirds in the Big Brother house, but he lost interest in her, following her continued quarrels with housemates, especially with her partner, Lolu. They both went on a date in the house, hoping to talk things through, but it did not produce much results. Speaking to Big Broter, Tobi said “I like her (Cee-C) very much from when we got to know each other but gradually it faded out.” Tobi however did not say this to Cee-C after the diary session, and as such, she does not know how he feels about her at the moment. Cee-C and her partner Lolu, (Ceelo) is up for eviction on Sunday, as well as Gelah (Angel and Ahneeka) and Lifu (Leo and Ifu-Enada)
