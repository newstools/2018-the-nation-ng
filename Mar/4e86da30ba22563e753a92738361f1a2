Supporters, associates and friends of a former member of the House of Representatives, Mashood Mustspha, yesterday organised a special prayer for the realisation of his governorship ambition. The prayers held in Isale Aluko area of Ilorin, the capital. Though the prayer was specifically organised to mark Mustapha’s 55th birthday, the clerics were requested to beseech God to grant his desire of becoming governor. One of the clerics, Alfa AbdulGaniyu Asileke, repeatedly asked the clerics and dignitaries to focus  the prayer on his governorship ambition. Mustapha, a close aide and ally of Senate President Bukola Saraki, is yet to make his ambition public, but his supporters have begun subtle moves to ensure that he clinches the seat in 2019. Mustapha was commissioner for Lands and Housing; special adviser (Special Duties) to ex-Governor Bukola Saraki between 2003 and 2011.
