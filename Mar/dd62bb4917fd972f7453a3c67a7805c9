Zlatan Ibrahimovic has left Manchester United and will be confirmed as a LA Galaxy player on Friday. The move to the Galaxy, worth a relatively modest £1million-a-year, is expected to be officially announced in a full-page advert in the Los Angeles Times and Ibrahimovic will travel to California for his unveiling next week. The 36-year-old Swedish star has signed a contract for the rest of this season and could make his debut against new rivals LAFC on March 31. United confirmed on Thursday that the remainder of Ibrahimovic’s one-year deal at Old Trafford has been cancelled, effectively ending the top-flight career of a striker who has also played for Barcelona, Ajax, Paris Saint-Germain, Juventus and both Milan clubs. The player tweeted: ‘Great things also come to an end and it is time to move on after two fantastic seasons with Manchester United. ‘Thank you to the club, the fans, the team, the coach, the staff and everybody who shared with me this part of my history.’ Ibrahimovic has been strongly linked with a move to the Galaxy for some time after it became clear that his brief but colourful United career was drawing to a close. The veteran striker had a superb first season in England and scored 28 goals, but he has struggled to recover from a ruptured cruciate ligament sustained in April. An early comeback in November did not go to plan and the last of his seven appearances this season came on Boxing Day. Ibrahimovic could line up against his old club if United confirm plans to play the Galaxy on their pre-season tour of America this summer.
