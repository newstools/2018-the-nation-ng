Some Nigerians deported from Libya yesterday disrupted a community advocacy programme by Edo State Task Force against Human Trafficking and Illegal migration. The Libya returnees said they were protesting methods adopted by the task force in selecting beneficiaries. Officials of the task force were held hostage by the protesters. Some items at the venue, such as loud speakers, canopies, chairs and six industrial fans were destroyed. Policemen from the Oba market station were called to the scene to  stop further disruption. One of the protesters; Jude Ikuenobe, said they were protesting  non-payment of the N20,000 monthly stipend and selective empowerment by the task force. According to Ikuenobe: “They have given some of those that just returned N1 million while those of us that came before them are yet to get anything from the government. “We know Governor Godwin Obaseki is trying but we are sorry to say that the task force members are enjoying themselves with what is meant for us (returnees). “To make things worse, they have resulted to treating us selectively, depending on who you know. I am aware that even those who have been trained on agriculture are yet to get the grant and land as promised by the governor. “With this in mind, how then do you explain the rationale behind given some individuals who just arrived in December N1 million as empowerment. This is why some returnees have gone back to Libya. A member of the task force and Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Governor, Mr Solomon Okoduwa, said all returnees have been captured into various empowerment programmes. “There is no delay in empowerment, the government did not envisage the large number of returnees and that is why the governor has accepted it as a challenge that requires the support and collaboration of all,” he said.
