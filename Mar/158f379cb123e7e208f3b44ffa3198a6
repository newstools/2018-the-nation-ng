POLICE in Florida, USA, have taken down three suspects in an alleged plot to rob and kill armoured guards. The dramatic sting operation carried out by dozens of officers was caught on police video in the middle of I-95 in Martin County, Florida. According to the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, the three men were planning to murder two armoured car employees in Port St. Lucie, Florida, and make off with millions of dollars in cash. The police operation took two years to complete, authAorities said, and was done in conjunction with the Martin County Sheriff’s Office, Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, Port St. Lucie Police, St. Lucie County Sheriff’s Office and the FBI. The take down took place at 9 a.m. on Feb. 20. Police helicopter video shows dozens of vehicles swarm the suspects on I-95 just hours before authorities said the suspects were to pull off the heist. Police forced the three suspects out of their vehicle, arresting Daryl Canady, Alger Lee Ellison and Martiavius Leon Williams. A police affidavit said the trio were to rob an armoured car outside a PNC Bank, kill the employees and then had planned another similar robbery and killing. One guard working on the truck was in on the plan to take the truck’s $4 million, the affidavit states. It also says the three men competed a “dry run” of the robbery five days earlier; however, a confidential informant tipped police off to the operation. “So you see in the video actually we have cars in front, cars in the back, vehicles on the side, and we just slowly tightened the noose, stopped the vehicle, and get them out. Nobody got hurt,” Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder said.
