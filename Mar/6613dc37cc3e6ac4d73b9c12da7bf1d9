Ajagba, who was Nigeria’s sole representative at the Rio Olympics boxing event in 2016 where he lost to Ivan Dychko in the quarterfinals, also knocked out Luke Lyons in the first round of his fight in October. Also fighting on the same undercard will be Nigeria’s former boxing team captain, Efetobor Apochi who will take on cruiserweight Darrius Flowers in a six-round attraction. Apochi will hope to continue his impressive beginnings to life in the pro ranks after winning his first two bouts by knockouts.
