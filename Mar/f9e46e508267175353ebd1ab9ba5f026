Represented by Mr Charles Anaelo, the commissioner noted that the NCFRMI was aware of the influx of over 10, 000 Cameroonian migrants presently in Kwande Local Government Area of the Benue state, adding that the commission in collaboration with the United Nation High Commission for the Refugees (UNHCR) is currently conducting data  registration of all the victims for further necessary action. She therefore reiterated the commission’s commitment to continue to work very hard to ensure that the lives of the IDPs are improved, rehabilitated and fully restored while stressing that in this phase of intervention, the commission had distributed food, care and empowerment items to POCs in the state
