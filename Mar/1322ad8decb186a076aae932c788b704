The Senate on Wednesday summoned the National Security Adviser, Maj. General Babagana Monguno (retd)  and the Attorney General of the Federal (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, over plan to disband vigilante group in Kogi State. The Senate mandated its Committee on National Security and Intelligence and Judiciary, Human Rights and Legal Matters to invite Monguno and Malami to explain the reasons behind the plan to outlaw vigilante group in Kogi State. A similar proposal to disband vigilante group in Rivers State failed after Senate President, Bukola Saraki put the proposal to vote. The resolution to disband vigilante group in Kogi State followed a motion of national urgent importance presented by Senator Dino Melaye (Kogi West). Melaye in his lead debate claimed that the Kogi State Government was planning to introduce state police in the state through the back door. He said: “I bring to the Senate a law passed by Kogi and signed into law by the governor about the establishment service. “Mr. President, I heard that it is a law of the government and when I went through this law, the law is in conflict with the constitution of Nigeria. This law alters the Nigeria Police Force as stipulated in section 214 of the constitution. “It is a fact that states can make laws through the State House of Assembly. But the law they make must not be in conflict with the constitution. I seek your indulgence to read a section of the law passed by Kogi State Government it reads: “The vigilante group will be involved in the prevention and detection of crimes, apprehension of criminals, preserving law and order, protection of lives and property and will assist other paramilitary agencies in the discharge of their duty.”
