Health workers in Nigeria under the aegis of Joint Health Sector Unions and Assembly of Health Care Professionals (JOHESU) would commence an indefinite strike on April 7. The Vice President of JOHESU, Mr. Chimele Ogbonna, stated this on Thursday when he led national officials of the body on a sensitization visit to Jos University Teaching Hospital (JUTH). “This strike is against our wish, but the Federal Government has failed to honour series of agreements with the workers from 2009 to 2017. “We have given the federal government an ultimatum of 30 working days that commenced on March 5 and will end on April 7. “If the agreements with JOHESU in 2009, 2014 and 2017 are not honoured, we will embark on indefinite nationwide strike. “The strike will be total and affect all health institutions from federal, state and local governments,” he said. The JOHESU vice president listed the issues that necessitated the pending industrial action to include failure to adjust CONHESS scale, skipping of CONHESS 10, and non- implementation of court judgements. Ogbonna said the health workers had explored all avenues for amicable settlement of the issues and were left with no other option on the matter. Other issues, according to him, included same scale promotions aberration, unpaid promotions arrears, skewed appointment of Chief Medical Directors and Chairmen of Medical Advisory Committee, among others. He said JUTH was chosen for the sensitization in the North Central because it was considered a very strong hospital in the region. NAN
