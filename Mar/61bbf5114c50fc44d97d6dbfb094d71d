Chairman of Senate Committee on Navy, Isa Misau, has assured work will soon commence on the building of the Navy War College in Idundu, Cross River State. Misau, who was on a visit to the Eastern Naval Command (ENC) of the Nigerian Navy, told reporters the clearing and fencing of the over 120 hectares of land where the War College would be situated would soon kick off. Misau, who was conducted round by the Flag Officer Commanding of the ENC, Rear Admiral Matthew Emuekpere, visited the site of the proposed War College, the Naval Ratings Housing Estate at Atimbo, the Navy Reference Hospital and the NNS Victory jetty in Calabar. “If the resources are not adequate, then we can look at the 2019 budget,” he said.
