A Magistrates’ Court in Minna on Tuesday, ordered the remand in prison of two men, Yusuf Adamu and Garba Sadiq, over alleged theft. The two suspects are standing trial on a two-count charge of criminal conspiracy and theft. The magistrate, Amina Musa, granted the prosecutor, Insp. Muazu Abdullahi’s request for their remand in custody to allow police complete its investigation in the matter. Musa adjourned the case until April 16 for further mention. Earlier, the prosecutor told the court that the accused persons were serial thieves, who specialized in stealing motorcycles from different locations in the state. Abdullahi alleged that a team of police detectives arrested the accused persons, following a tip off from a reliable source on March 16. He said the alleged offence contravened Sections 97 and 287 of the penal code. The accused persons, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge.  NAN
