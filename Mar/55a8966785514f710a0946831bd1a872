The Igbo socio-cultural organisations, Ohanaeze Ndigbo warned Biafra agitators on Thursday that their dream would not be achieved by fighting, noise making, name calling and insults. The President-General of Ohanaeze, Chief John Nwodo, stated this at a lecture organised by the Student Affairs Department of the University of Nigeria (UNN), College of Medicine, Ituku-Ozalla, Enugu. According to him, Biafra can be actualized through “political diplomacy.” Nwodo said: “We cannot get Biafra by fighting and insulting people.  We cannot get restructuring by shouting. We can get it through political diplomacy.  I must tell you the truth.” The Ohanaeze chief, who recently accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of plotting to disenfranchise Ndigbo from participating actively in the 2019 general elections by stopping them from participating in the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR), urged the Igbos to obtain their voters card and be part of the electoral process.
