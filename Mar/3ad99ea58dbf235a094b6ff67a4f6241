The 20th edition of ‘Songs of Praise’, an annual mega choral concert organized by the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Alagomeji, Yaba, Lagos is scheduled to hold on Sunday, March 18, 2018. Featuring 400 Voices, the church’s Mass Choir, the concert holds between 5pm and 8pm. According to Pastor Sunday Ebenezer Oludare, the superintendent in-charge of Yaba District of the church, the programme was borne out of the need to spread the whole essence of using both classical and contemporary music and songs to worship God in a very special way. “It is usually time for music ministration,” said Oludare, who noted that the choir is affiliated to the London School of Music. “Indeed this church has produced the mass choir that we are proud of.  This year will be the 20th edition of it. Every year, we call together choristers from so many churches to be part of this.  It involves choirs that may not also be from CAC churches.  Yet the idea is usually to reach across to as many choirs as we can from across Lagos State.” The chairperson of the planning committee, Deaconess Shade Jacobs, said that it is beautiful the programme which started 20 years was coinciding with Lenten period. “So, we believe there is no better time for us to do it than now,” she said. 400 Voices was mooted as a result of an invitation extended to the CAC, Yaba, in 1997 by the MUSON Centre, Lagos. After series of participations, the church decided to have its own programme tagged, ‘Songs of Praise,’ involving 400 Voices, with choirs drawn from other churches.
