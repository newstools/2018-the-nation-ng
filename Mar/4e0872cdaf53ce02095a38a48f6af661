The Katsina State Government has approved the employment of 1,000 security guards for all boarding schools in the state. The state governor, Aminu Masari, disclosed this during the Third Convocation ceremony of the Umaru Musa Yar’adua University, Katsina, on Saturday. Masari said the decision followed the prevailing security situation in the country. ‘“Even though Katsina is considered as one of the most peaceful states in the country, the government is not taking chances to allow students to be vulnerable to attacks by criminals. “The state government is committed to protection of lives and property of all citizens as well as the students,’’ the governor said. Masari recalled that when he assumed office in 2015, he made it clear that his mission was to recover the state’s lost glory in education and agriculture. He said his administration equipped existing schools, built new ones, increased the number of enrolment and recruited qualified teachers to make the sector attractive. “We believe that a learned society that is attune to the demand of its time is a more successful one, that is why we continuously commit a huge percentage of the state budget to the education sector,’’ he said.
