Kwara State Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed has urged governments to do more to reduce youth unemployment and restiveness. He restated his government’s commitment to give full scholarship to 195 students to begin entrepreneurship training at the International Vocational Technical and Entrepreneurship College (IVTEC), Ajase-Ipo, Kwara State. Ahmed called on contractors, corporate bodies, organisations and individuals to sponsor youths to the college as part of their corporate social responsibilities. According to the governor, the college was established to provide youths with entrepreneurship skills to help them key into the economic challenges. At the end of their training, beneficiaries will be supported through Micro, Small and Medium Scale Enterprises (MSMEs). He said: “Gone were the days when youths depended on government to secure white collar jobs. Today, the government’s pre-occupation is to create enabling environment for youths to acquire prerequisite trainings to be independent and self-reliant.”
