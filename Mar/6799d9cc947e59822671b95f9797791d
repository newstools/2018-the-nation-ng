Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has been endorsed a second term by Igbos living in  the state. The ‘Igbo Vision in All Progressives Congress (APC)’ has started mobilising to ensure victory for the governor in 2019, according to Lagos APC Publicity Secretary Mr. Joe Igbokwe. He said stakeholders have resolved to support the governor for a second term, because of his excellent performance. Igbokwe said outcome of the 2019 election would convince the ethnic group the APC is the most reliable  party. The Publicity Secretary said Ndigbo would vote for the governor in next year’s poll. He said: “In recognition of his hard work, we are going to come out in millions to support him once again through voting. “I know that the Igbo, under the aegis of Igbo Vision, supported Ambode to become governor in the face of victimisation. But they have not been recognised for their loyalty. Today, I want to assure you that our governor did not forget the Igbo; you will be rewarded at the appropriate time.” Igbokwe said although Ambode’s government does not share money, it has impacted positively on the lives of the people through its developmental projects. He added: “We have seen physical developments across Lagos and the ongoing transformation in Ladipo market is one of the numerous projects to make life better for Lagosians. We are pleased with this and we want it to continue.” The Vice President, Association of Ndieze Igbo in Diaspora Worldwide, Chief Uche Dimgba, said his group has commenced sensitisation of Igbos in Lagos. He said Igbos in the state have been enjoined to get their voters’ cards. Dimgba added: “We also encouraged those that have voters card to come out and vote for Ambode in recognition of his selfless service to the development of Lagos State. Lagos State is our home and this is where we have majority of our investments.”
