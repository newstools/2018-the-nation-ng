After a narrow loss in the final of the 2018 ITTF, Africa Top 16 Cup, Aruna Quadri has praised the heroic performance of Egypt’s Omar Assar. He however said  that the Egyptian was lucky to have won the title. Quadri who rallied from 3-1 down to level at 3-3 and only to lose the seventh game in keenly contested tie told NationSport that it was obvious that the match would have gone either way but said that he gave his best in the tournament. “I think I am happy with my performance because I know that it is not every time you have to win. You win some and you lose some but I must commend myself for making it to the final and this goes to show that I performed well. The final was indeed an epic one because Assar and I really gave our best. It was unfortunate I had to lose having come from the back to level up the match. As usual I will have to redouble my efforts again,” he said. Quadri however urged government to support other sports rather than focus solely on football. “I am just going to appeal to those in charge of sports in Nigeria to give sport like table tennis the needed support rather than spending the whole tax-payers money on football. It is unfortunate that most African nations never considered other sports and when it comes to multi-sports tournament they will be expecting the athletes to perform magic with less support,” he lamented. As part of his build up to the 2018 Commonwealth Games, Quadri on Sunday departed Kenya to Qatar for the second ITTF World Tour in 2018. The Portugal-based star is expected to contest for honours against the array of stars already confirmed for the mouth-watering tournament holding in Doha from Tuesday March 5.
