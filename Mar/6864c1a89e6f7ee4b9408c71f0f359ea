Malt drink brand, Maltina, from the stable of Nigerian Breweries, on Tuesday celebrated the International Day of Happiness by sharing happiness with commuters in Lagos. In line with the essence of Sharing Happiness, Maltina’s happiness ambassador; Happy the Mascot, made appearances across Lagos on the Happiness Bus ride to delight commuters and share the true meaning of happiness. The commuters also got a chance to be refreshed and revitalized with ice cold Maltina. The Happiness Bus rides happened on the Lagos BRT route along the Ikotun – Iyana Ipaja and LASU to Igando. Speaking on the initiative, the Portfolio manager, Non Alcoholic Drinks, Ngozi Nkwoji said; “This year in particular, the theme of the International Day of Happiness was “Share Happiness” which as we know is the essence of the Maltina brand. This presented an opportunity to indeed Share Happiness within our immediate environs. Every day is an opportunity to bring this essence to life and is something every individual must strive to do daily.” Nkwoji said that commuters were positively surprised when what typically is a routine trip turned out to be the one trip they did not want to end. “Maltina continues to extend its value proposition with new and engaging ways to bring smiles to people’s faces, whilst sticking to its brand ethos that a healthy you is a happy you. Maltina firmly believes in this ideology and is taking steps to remind everyday Nigerians of the subtle beautiful moments we sometimes overlook,” she added. The International Day of Happiness which is celebrated annually on March 20 is set aside as a reminder that progress goes beyond economic achievements and into increasing human happiness and well-being as a tool for prosperity.
