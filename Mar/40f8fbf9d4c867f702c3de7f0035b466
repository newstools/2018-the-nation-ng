The board of directors of the company has recommended distribution of N305 million as cash dividend to shareholders, representing a dividend per share of 16 kobo. Director, Corporate and Government Affairs, Cadbury West Africa, Bala Yesufu attributed the turnaround to the studious implementation of the company’s restructuring programme. “We have been working assiduously over the years to turnaround our loss situation. We are happy to announce that we finally realized our vision to reposition Cadbury for improved performance, in 2017,” Yesufu said. Cordros Capital described the results as “better than expected” noting that Cadbury Nigeria surpassed estimates for the fourth quarter. “We believe Cadbury Nigeria’s revenue growth in fourth quarter 2017 was largely volume-driven, as opposed to fourth quarter 2016 which was majorly on prices,” Cordros Capital stated.
