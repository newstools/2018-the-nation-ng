Edo State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has warned Pastor’s to desist from offering prayers for human traffickers and their victims. The Benin Monarch, Oba Ewuare II had last week said it was regrettable that some church leaders in the state encouraged human trafficking and illegal migration in the country. Oba Ewuare II also called on church leaders to help discourage illegal migration and trafficking of the youths as reports showed that some church leaders were encouraging it. Addressing journalists Monday, Chairman of CAN, Bishop Oyenude Kure, said the Bible preached against human trafficking and as such pastors that prays for traffickers to succeed are fake. Bishop Kure who condemned the action of pastors supporting human trafficking urged them to repent of their sins or face will face the wrath of God. He stated that the action of such pastors was worrisome and declared that any Pastor involved in the act either through prayers or directly as an enemy of the church. Kure disclosed of plans by CAN to on the 18th of May pray for Edo State and the country especially for the release of Dapchi school girls. The Christian body also condemned killings by Fulani herdsmen and urged government to establish cattle ranches rather than cattle colonies. Bishop Kure said CAN will resist any attempt to establish cattle colonies in Edo state. On the coming 2019 general elections, Bishop Kure admonished Christians in the state ‘to get their PVCs. If you have not done that we are asking you to do that. We are also saying that all Christians should go and join political parties of their own choice so that we will be involved in the political destiny of our state and nation. So that we can move our nation forward.”
