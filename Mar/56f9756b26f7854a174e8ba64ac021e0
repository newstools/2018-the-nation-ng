Federation Crude Oil and Gas liftings are broadly classified into Equity Export and Domestic. Both categories are lifted and marketed by NNPC and the proceeds remitted into the Federation Account. Equity Export receipts are paid directly into Federation Account domiciled in Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) after adjusting for Joint Venture (JV) Cash Calls. Domestic Crude Oil of 445,000bopd is allocated for refining to meet domestic products supply. Payments are effected to the Federation Account by NNPC after adjusting for crude oil and product losses, pipeline repairs and management cost incurred during the period. NNPC also lifts crude oil and gas, other than the Equity and Domestic Crude Oil, on behalf of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) and the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), proceeds of which are remitted into the Federation Account. Third Party Finance liftings are crude oil and gas from fields that are financed using alternative finance/loan facility which require the servicing of debts before remitting the balance into the Federation Account as Price Balance.
