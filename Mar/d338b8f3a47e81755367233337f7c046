Super Eagles’ duo of Jude Ighalo and left back Elderson Echiejile have called on Nigerian fans to keep supporting the team ahead of tonight’s International friendly game against Serbia. In a telephone interview, Ighalo appealed to Nigerian fans to keep the support coming for the team against Serbia. ”We appreciate Nigerians, their support has been immense, but we need more prayers, and their unending support. The fans support has really been great for the team,” Ighalo told Brila FM. Meanwhile, Elderson Echiejile also appreciated the fans for their support so far, while urging the supporters for more. ”Nigerians have been really fantastic with their support, and we are hoping to get more from them,” Echiejile stated. Elderson further reaffirmed his readiness to give his best to the team whenever called upon. ”Currently, we are happy things are positive, and we are working hard for things to be better in each game. And whenever I get called upon, I am always ready to give my best, even though we are playing a friendly game, it’s a time to test the players, and whenever called upon, I always give my best,” he added. While thanking Nigeria fans for their support, Echiejile said the team will continue to do well in a bid to put smiles on the faces of Nigerians. The Super Eagles will face Serbia after beating Poland on home soil in the second International friendly game in London today.
