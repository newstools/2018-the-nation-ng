The Football Association of Serbia have tweeted that Head Coach Mladen Krstajic will announce his roster for the upcoming friendlies against Nigeria and Morocco today. The likes of Marko Grujic (Cardiff City), Uroš Spajic (Anderlecht), Luka Milivojevic (Crystal Palace), Dušan Tadic (Southampton) and Marko Dmitrovic (Eibar) will discover if they have been included in the squad. However, one name certain to be summoned for the game is Manchester United central midfielder Nemanja Matic, but the same cannot be said about his brother, F.C. Copenhagen midfielder Uroš Matic. Serbia will battle Morocco at Stadion Rajko Mitic (Beograd) on March 23 and four days later they will face the Super Eagles at the Hive Stadium in the English capital. The Football Association of Serbia arranged for the friendlies against the two strong African teams to prepare the national team for the World Cup as there’s a possibility they will meet African opposition in the quarterfinals of the 2018 World Cup if they qualify from Group E. The Serbian national team occupy the 34th position in the latest Fifa ranking for the month of February.
