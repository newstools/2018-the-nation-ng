The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Friday closed its case in the prosecution of former Senior Special Assistant to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan on Domestic Affairs, Dr. Waripamo-Owei Dudafa. EFCC arraigned Dudafa and Iwejuo Joseph Nna before Justice Mohammed Idris of the Federal High Court in Lagos on 23-count charge of conspiracy to conceal proceeds of crime amounting to N1.6billion on June 11, 2013. Prosecuting counsel, Mr. Rotimi Oyedepo, after tendering some documents, said he had no more witnesses to call. Oyedepo added that he intended to file an amended charge without re-opening his case. Defence counsel, Gboyega Oyewole (SAN) and Ige Asemudara, said they would make a no-case submission on the matter. The defendants allegedly concealed the sum through a company, Seagate Property Development and Investment Ltd, an  offence contrary to Section 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) (Amendment) Act, 2012 and punishable  under Section 17(a). They were also accused of knowingly concealing proceeds of crime through Avalon Global Property Development Company Ltd in the sum of N 399, 470,000.00, among others. EFCC said Dudafa “procured” Nna and Ebiwise Resources to conceal N150million being proceeds of crime.
