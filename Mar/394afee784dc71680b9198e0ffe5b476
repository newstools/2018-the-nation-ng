  Tips on Wednesday Champions League Goals  GOAL! TOTTENHAM 1-0 JUVENTUS (Son 39) Wembley erupts as Spurs’ dominant first-half display is rewarded. Son makes amends for a missed chance moments earlier as he is on hand to tuck away a scuffed shot from Trippier’s pass across goal. Not the cleanest finish but a big goal. Juventus now need to score at least two.  GOAL – Man City 1-1 Basel (agg 5-1) Mohamed Elyounoussi (17 mins) Is the comeback on? No, but Basel are level on the night. Mohamed Elyounoussi gets the ball in plenty of space in the centre of the box, he takes a touch and rifles it past Claudio Bravo. Moments earlier, Ilkay Gundogan almost made it 2-0, but his shot from Bernardo Silva’s cross was straight at Tomas Vaclik. GOAL – Man City 1-0 Basel Gabriel Jesus (8 mins) The tie was already over. Now it is definitely over. Gabriel Jesus is starting for the first time this year, but he has lost none of his sharpness in front of goal. To be fair, my gran could have tapped it in. On a plate. Slick interplay from City ends in Bernado Silva crosses for Jesus to tap in from close range.
