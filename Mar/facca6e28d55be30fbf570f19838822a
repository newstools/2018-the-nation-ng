The wife of the Rivers State Governor, Justice Eberechi Suzzette Nyesom-Wike, has called for increased investment in charity by members of the society. She stated that everyone must find opportunities to touch lives, no matter how little. She spoke on Tuesday when she led Rivers women to visit four  less privileged persons homes as part of the events to mark this year’s International Women’s Day. The Rivers governor’s wife urged women to practice charity, saying all responsible women have innate traits of charity. She said: “Women are natural care-givers.  Women are very great part of our lives and they cannot be dispensed with. “The more opportunities women have, they more opportunities they have to prove their mettle. Women work hard to promote the growth of the society “. She added: “Charity is part of womanhood. We are naturally kind and we dont want any child to suffer. “Kindness never goes out of fashion.  It knows no dialect or language and it is always fine” She noted that aside the official visits to the homes, she reaches out to them on a monthly basis. Rivers State Women Affairs Commissioner Mrs Ukel Oyaghiri stated that the Rivers State government would continue to execute programmes that will support the less privileged persons. Matron of Special Child School, Sister Silvia Anyanwu said the donation of gifts and food items will help the school cater for her students. Reverend Sister Maryjane Raphael, Matron of the Home for the Elderly said that inmates look forward  to the visits of Justice Eberechi Suzzette Nyesom-Wike because of her kindness. The Matron of Port Harcourt Children’s Home, Grace Eke assured the wife of the Rivers State Governor that the home will continue to live up her expectations by taking care of the children.
