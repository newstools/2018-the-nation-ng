The Federal Government’s efforts at eliminating child labour has received a boost. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has taken the campaign on National Reporting Template on Child Labour to the Southsouth geo-political zone. Declaring open a two-day capacity building workshop on the National Reporting Template on Child Labour for stakeholders in Port-Harcourt, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Labour and Employment, Bolaji Adebiyi, said child labour posed a great threat to global peace. He said: “As you are aware, child labour presents a serious challenge at global and national levels and requires concerted efforts by all stakeholders to overcome. That is why the Ministry of Labour and Employment over the years worked assiduously in collaboration with Developmental Partners and other Stakeholders to develop robust National Policies on Child Labour with a view to combat the menace.” Adebiyi, represented by his Technical Adviser, Mr. Emmanuel Igbinosun, emphasised that until recent times there was no national reporting template for proper monitoring, evaluation and data collation on child labour in Nigeria. “Today, we are at the threshold of history as I present to you a National Reporting Template on Child Labour in Nigeria as validated by all stakeholders,” he said. He said the template would not only facilitate the generation of data but serve as a valuation mechanism to facilitate the identification of gaps in the implementation of multi-sectoral strategies and processes as well as provide the basis for proactive and remedial actions aimed at reducing or eliminating child labour.
