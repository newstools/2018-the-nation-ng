 Mario Balotelli has lampooned Nigerian born Italy’s first black Senator Tony Iwobi for standing in the Italian elections for far-right anti-immigrant league party. The Nigerian is counting his blessings after emerging as Senator elect from the Northern Industrial City of Brescia considered a major immigration hub in Italy, but Balotteli of the “Why Always Me” fame is not amused at all taking to his instagram to give the Nigerian born senator a piece of his mind. ‘Maybe I’m blind or maybe they haven’t told him that he’s black yet. Disgrace!’  Balotelli wrote on Tuesday in a post that was subsequently removed. Balotelli, who was born in Palermo to Ghanaian parents and has played 33 times for Italy, has long been a target for racist abuse. Iwobi has long argued along with League leader Matteo Salvini that increased racism in Italy should be blamed on illegal immigration. Balotelli posted a photo showing Iwobi, 60, and Salvini both wearing t-shirts emblazoned with the campaign slogan ‘Stop invasion’. The slogan is reference to the more than 690,000 migrants who have landed on Italian shores from North Africa since 2013. The League blames the arrivals for ‘social conflict’ and making Italian cities less safe. Born in Gusau in northern Nigeria but living in Italy since the 1970s, Iwobi has been a supporter of the League for more than two decades. But the Senator in a swift reaction advised the former Manchester City and Liverpools ace to concentrate on his own area of calling. ‘I’m not interested in what Balotelli thinks,’ Iwobi said in response. ‘He’s a great footballer; I hope he sticks to doing what he’s good at. Meanwhile, Italy’s anti-establishment Five Star Movement reached out to leftist parties on Wednesday in a bid to end the stalemate from a general election, even as a rightwing alliance lobbied for its right to rule.
