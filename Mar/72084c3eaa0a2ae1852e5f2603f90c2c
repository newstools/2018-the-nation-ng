Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr is elated with the arrival of 11 Super Eagles’ stars in Warsaw, Poland for the pre- World Cup grade A friendly match between the Eagles and host Poland slated for Friday. The coach would have preferred all the players arrived yesterday as earlier scheduled but he told NationSport that injury and visa problems have forced some of them to arrive in Warsaw today. As at today (yesterday) the Eagles camp has swelled to 11 players, while the first training took place yesterday evening. Some of the players in camp are Vice Captain Onazi Ogenyi, Leon Balogun, Troost Ekong, Brian Idowu, Ola Aina, John Ogu, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, Wilfred Ndidi, Kelechi Iheanacho and Alex Iwobi.
