 Five students of Obafemi Awolowo University were on Thursday charged to court over an alleged assault on the school officials. The Nation gathered that the students were handed over to the police by the university management on Wednesday accusing them of assaulting a university official. Eye witnesses made it known that the students opposed the forced eviction of students from a female hostel, Moremi hall, on Wednesday. The five students; Gbenga Olaniran, Oyedeji Samson, Olajide Adedamola, Jimoh Oladipupo and Adeniji John, were present at the Ife Magistrate Court during the trial. Students and journalists were denied access to the court room by the officials of theFederal Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) of the Nigerian Police. The team who was led by Askme Moses said it was an instruction by the Area Commander (AC) of the police. Moses said no student or journalist should enter the court room. The Nation learnt from Opeyemi Oprah, the acting Studentsâ€™ Union security officer present in court, that the arraigned students were granted bail. The bail terms for each of the students includes N500,000 bond and provision of two sureties, who must be civil servants of level 11 and above as well as tax payers. A counsel to the students, Barrister Philip, told The Nation that the bail application was the first step before further court proceedings. After the court sitting, it was seen that students protested outside the court premises against the bail terms by raising placards and chanting songs. Samuel Dunnex, a student and a member of the Democratic Socialist Movement (DSM), stated that the bail conditions were too stringent.
