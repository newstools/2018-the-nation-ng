The fraud trial of Chairman of Innoson Motors Limited, Mr. Innocent Chukwuma, was stalled at the Ikeja Special Offences Court on Wednesday. Chukwuma failed to appear in court for his arraignment for alleged fraud. That was the third time the Innoson Motor chief had failed to appear in court despite a subsisting bench warrant for his arrest. Justice Mojisola Dada of the Lagos High Court, Ikeja, had on February 9 ordered Chukwuma to enter his defence for fraud charges filed against him by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). During Wednesdayâ€™s proceedings, it was revealed that Innoson Motors chief had filed a petition at the National Judicial Commission (NJC) against the judge. Our correspondent gathered that the petitioner asked the Justice Dada to withdraw from the case.
