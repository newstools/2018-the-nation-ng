AHEAD of the 2019 general elections, some chieftains of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ogun State, particularly in Ogun West senatorial district, have described the Speaker of the Ogun State House of Assembly, Hon. Suraj Adekunbi, as a gubernatorial aspirant on the platform of the ruling party with all the wherewithal to succeed incumbent Governor Ibikunle Amosun. The APC chieftains, including a former Minister of State for Education, Senator Iyabo Anisulowo, Bolaji  Aretola and Mrs. Funmilayo Adeniran, noted that in order for the party to have a smooth sail in the next year’s election, the APC must present a governorship candidate who had contested election for political office before now and has had experience in governance. The leaders said Adekunbi, who hails from the Ogun West senatorial district, fits the bill of the kind of governor the state needs after Governor Amosun’s tenure. The party leaders stated these recently in Ilaro, Yewa South Local Government area of the state, when Adekunbi met with women groups from the Ogun West Senatorial District as part of his consultations for the 2019 governorship. In her own speech, Anisulowo said the APC leaders in the senatorial district will work with Governor Amosun to select the best aspirant with the capacity to win the next governorship election and also continue the laudable programmes of the incumbent administration. She added that such an aspirant must be a politician, be accessible and also competent. On his part, Aretola, a former local government chairman, said the Speaker, considering his political experience and unflinching loyalty to the ruling party, remains the most formidable aspirant from Yewaland among those seeking to succeed Amosun. “If we have somebody that is number three citizen in the state and the governor would want us to prop up somebody from this senatorial district to become governor for the very first time, I think such a person is our best choice,” he said.
