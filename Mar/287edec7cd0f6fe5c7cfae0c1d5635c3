Popular comediennes will today thrill guests to an evening of fun and laughter at the Grand Ballroom, Eko Hotels & Suites, Victoria Island, Lagos. The comedy show tagged ‘Ladies of Laughter’ will have Chigul, Wofai Fada, Lolo 1, Mandy, Lepacious Bose, Princess and Helen Paul in performance. The comediennes who are excited at performing at this event packaged by organisers to celebrate and appreciate the craft of female comedians as well as embrace the #TimesUp campaign being led by women all over the world, are already uploading the poster of the event to spread the news. The organisers also explained that though the Nigerian comedy industry is well-grounded, it still remains a male-dominated industry. Thus the brain behind the show, to celebrate the women that have been able to break the bars and establish themselves, as well as encourage the upcoming or aspiring comedians.
