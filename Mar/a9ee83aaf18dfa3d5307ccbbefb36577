DO Den Haag defender Tyronne Ebuehi is back in training with his Dutch side few days after it was feared that he will miss Nigeriaâ€™s friendly games against Poland and Serbia. In a video posted by the club, which was monitored by Owngoalnigeria.com, Ebuehi who made his international bow for Nigeria against Argentina in a pre-World Cup friendly which the Eagles won 4-2, was sighted among the players in training. His return to training will no doubt delight Coach Gernot Rohr after he (Ebuehi) limped out of his team 2-0 loss against NAC Breda with a groin injury. The defender who shunned the chance to play for the Netherlands in preference for Nigeria has been ever present for the modest Dutch side this season, and his progress has already earned him a move to Portuguese side Benfica. He is thought to have agreed terms with the Portuguese giants for a move in the summer, when his current deal with ADO Den Haag runs out.
