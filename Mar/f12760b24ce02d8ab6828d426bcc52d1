The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) has donated laptops and accounting textbooks to some tertiary institutions in line with its mission to support the profession’s growth. The benefiting schools are Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) in Zaria, Kaduna State; Benson Idahosa University (BIU) in Edo State; Paul University and Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu University (COOU) in Anambra State. Others are Delta State Polytechnic, Federal College of Education (Technical), Lagos and Lagos State University (LASU). While presenting the books, ICAN President, Ismaila Zakari, said the gesture was borne out of the association’s determination to add value, build capacity and improve the standard in the teaching of accountancy in tertiary institutions. He said: “As a professional body committed to technical excellence and in line with its statutory mandate of setting standards and regulating the practice of accountancy in the country, the institute proactively reacted to challenges facing tertiary institutions by instituting policies to support the growth and development of accounting education in Nigeria. “It is instructive to stress that, apart from setting standard and regulating the practice of accountancy in the country, the institute also ensures that its potential members receive appropriate and quality technical and academic training, which could be benchmarked against global standards.” Zakari said it was in appreciation of the role of information technology on the accountancy profession and the dearth of study materials for students that propelled the institute to invest in acquisition of modern gadgets and textbooks to assist students in using Information Technology (IT) to gain insight into the relevant accounting software.
