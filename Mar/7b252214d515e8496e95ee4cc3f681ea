President Mohammodu Buhari on Tuesday summoned the Inspector-General of Police, Ibrahim Idris, to answer query as to why he breached a Presidential order to relocate to Benue following reported killings in the state. It would be recalled that President Buhari had on Jan. 9 directed the Inspector-General to move to Benue with a view to check the reported cases of attacks on innocent citizens in the state. However, President Buhari who was on official visit to Benue on Monday in continuation of his tour of troubled areas in the country was told by Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue that the Inspector-General refused to obey his directive, alleging that Idris only spent 24 hours in Benue, and later moved to neigbouring Nasarawa state. NAN reliably gathered that the Inspector-General was in the Presidential villa apparently to explain his flouting of the President’s order to remain in Benue at the height of the incidence between farmers and herdsmen. President Buhari who is believed to have summoned the IG, received him in a private audience. The IG left about 30 minutes after without speaking to anyone. ‘”`It is believed that the president demanded for a full report on police operations till date after which he will make further decisions. “”There is a renewed resolve to make sure that the killings and bad security situation in Benue State abates,’’ the source further confided to our correspondent. When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Malam Garba Shehu confirmed the meeting but refused to disclose details.(NAN)
