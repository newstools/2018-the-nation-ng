Speaking at the event, Chairman, Caverton Offshore  Support Group, Remi Makanjuola, said the unveiling by  Caverton fleet of helicopters is a feat and a day Nigeria should be proud of. He said :”This is a day that the aviation industry should be proud of that a Nigerian went to America to acquire 11 helicopters. This is a ground breaking event. Over the past few years, we went through many phases of development as a company in less than favourable circumstances. Nevertheless, we have been able to operate existing contracts successfully, as well as secure a few new contracts.
