The son of Angola’s ex-President, José Eduardo dos Santos, has been formally accused of fraud over the alleged illegal transfer of $500m (£350m) from the central bank to the United Kingdom. José Filomeno dos Santos is also barred from leaving the country, deputy Attorney General, Luis Benza Zanga, said. Mr. dos Santos is the highest profile person targeted in new President João Lourenço’s anti-corruption drive, the BBC reports. He had led oil-rich Angola’s sovereign wealth fund during his father’s rule. However, he was removed from this role in January, months after a BBC investigation into Angola’s $5bn fund and following an internal governance review. The allegations against him relate to the $500m transferred to a British bank, which was then frozen by authorities in the UK. The UK said the money can now be returned. Mr. dos Santos was formally named a suspect in the investigation, along with the former governor of Angola’s central bank, Valter Filipe da Silva. Neither were immediately available for comment on the matter. Mr. Zanga said there was no chance of the case falling under any sort of amnesty currently being offered by the government. “A pardon will not work. This case will run to its final outcome,” he said.
