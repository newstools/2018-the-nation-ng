The Southwest regional think tank for government policies, the Development Agenda for Western Agenda (DAWN) Commission, has concluded plan with other partners to organise the maiden Southwest e-commerce and Expo 2018 in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, from March 26 to 28. The expo, which aims at introducing a new culture of electronic business transactions in the region, is a partnership between the DAWN Commission, Bank of Industry (BOI) and Nustream Conference and Culture Centre. It is said to be in tandem with the mission of the commission, especially on economic competitiveness, social and human development. The expo, with the theme: The Future Started Yesterday and We’re Already Late, will hold at the Nustream Conference and Culture Centre in Ibadan, the organisers said. Addressing reporters to herald the summit, the Acting Director General of DAWN Commission, Seye Oyeleye, noted that the internet connectivity and powerful online tools had resulted in a new commerce arena, called e-commerce. The commission’s chief stressed that “e-commerce offers many advantages to companies and customers”. The media briefing at the commission’s Cocoa House headquarters in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, was attended by a BOI representative, Pacquedis Irabor; Nustream Conference and Culture Centre and IBridge Hub Founder/Chief Executive Officer, Francis Madojenu and e-entrepreneurial consultant, Ladi Thompson.
