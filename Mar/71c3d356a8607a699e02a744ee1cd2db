Former Super Eagles’ player, Emmanuel Amuneke has urged the players to add more flair and bite into their display when they take on Serbia on Tuesday, whilst positing that the 1-0 victory over Poland last Friday was far from convincing. The former Golden Eaglets’ coach, who spoke to AOIFootball.com from Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, said though the Eagles did win the game against all odds, the manner of the victory leaves much to be desired of a Nigerian national team. “Honestly, it’s a good we won to boost the morale of the players, but looking at the game critically, I will say a lot still needs to be done ahead of their subsequent matches. “Their ball circulation and distribution was very poor, and we could not even string four, five passes complete in the opponent’s half. So, I think if they can work on these aspects, the team will do better in subsequent matches,” Amuneke said. The former Al-Khartoum Watani coach further urged the handlers of the team to work more on the team’s organisation and their movement on and off the ball. The Super Eagles are due to face Serbia in their second build-up game to the FIFA World Cup, at the Hive Stadium tonight. The match kicks off by 8pm Nigerian time.
