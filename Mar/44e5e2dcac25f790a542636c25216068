Stakeholders in the agricultural sector have kicked against palm oil   import , urging President Muhammadu Buhari and the Federal Executive Council (FEC) to halt the trend. Nigeria, according to a report, spent N116.3 billion on palm oil import last year. Speaking with The Nation, the farmers and members of the Plantation Owners Forum of Nigeria (POFN) said they were in support of the move by the Senate to ban palm oil import. The Senate urged the Federal Government to ban palm oil import to encourage local production and protect the farmers. The POFN said the adoption of a motion entitled: “Urgent need to halt the importation of palm oil and its allied products to protect palm oil Industry in Nigeria” by the Senate deserved commendation and support of all Nigerians. The group commended the sponsor of the motion, Senator Francis Alimikhena, for decrying the importation of palm oil. POFN’s Executive Secretary Mr Fatai Afolabi joined the Senate and Alimikhena in expressing concern that importation of palm kernel and allied palm products were threats to Federal Government’s campaign on diversification of the economy through increased agricultural production and exports. The group said it was unhappy that Nigeria imported about 450,000 tonnes of palm oil worth N116.3 billion last year, urging the Federal Government to stop it to boost local production.
