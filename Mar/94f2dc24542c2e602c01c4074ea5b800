Shortly after posting a picture in a tight-fitting gold sequined gown, exposing her boobs, controversial actress, Tonto Dikeh, has received a backlash from fans who belief the dress sense betrays her claim of being a born again Christian. Not one to take such criticisms lying down, the mother of one has taken to her Instagram to warn critics whom she described as haters, threatening to upload more daring pictures if they do not let her be. She wrote: “Those of you disagreeing with my outfit on my last post simply because am born again shouldn’t annoy me at all or I will release a bikini picture. “My friend calm your self-righteous ignorant selves down, you can’t judge me li lie… Leave that job for God and work on your happiness and appreciation skill. I am joking ooo… But if you come for me I will cyber murder you my nigga.” In her caption to the photograph in which she was sporting the dress, the actress described herself as The Alpha Woman (A King). According to her: “I am Strong. I am so Damn Beautiful in and out from Head to Toe (Created on a special day). I am a fighter I don’t do pity parties. I am a champion. I am resilient. I create a life and I live it. I don’t put myself down or allow any put me down no more. I am a pro woman. I don’t compete for attention. I am a Drama Queen.” “I make money move. I know when a ship has sailed I know when to move. I am straight forward no in between with me (Its either white or black). I don’t give second chances when hurt, I don’t do cliques I am an embodiment of clique all put in one. I invest in my joy purposefully. I know the life I live is intimidating and annoying to a lot of people but I don’t care I live it still.
