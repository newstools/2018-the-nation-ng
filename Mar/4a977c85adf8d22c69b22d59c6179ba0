The European Union’s trade commissioner said on Saturday there is “no immediate clarity” from the United States on how the bloc can gain exemption from new tariffs on imported steel and aluminium imposed by President Donald Trump. Cecilia Malmstrom met with the U.S Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer and Japan’s Trade Minister, Hiroshige Seko, in Brussels, the BBC reports. She said discussions would continue next week. Mr. Seko called for calm-headed behaviour in the dispute. The EU said its exports should be excluded from the measures. Mr. Trump’s announcement of import tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium has sparked fears of a trade war. The EU has threatened retaliatory tariffs on U.S goods, including iconic products like bourbon and blue jeans.
