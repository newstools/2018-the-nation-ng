 Edo State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Thursday received a boost by accepting 10,000 defectors from opposition political parties in the state. Among the defectors was a chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party in Esan West local government area, Mr. Felix Akhabue. Akhabue is regarded as the strongman of the PDP in Esan West. The defectors announced their membership of the APC at a mega rally to round campaigns ahead of Saturday local elections in the state. Minister of Youths and Sports, Barr. Solomon Dalung, said the rally was a requiem for the PDP in the state. Governor Godwin Obaseki in his speech promised to deliver 1.2million votes for the APC in next year’s general elections.
