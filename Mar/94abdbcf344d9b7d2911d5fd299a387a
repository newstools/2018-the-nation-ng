Come June, the Lagos State governor, His Excellency, Akinwunmi Ambode will be celebrated through song and dance in the anticipated Stage Play, ‘Isale Eko’. In the words of the executive producer of the play, Joseph Edgar, ‘the giant strides of the Ambode-led Administration in Lagos especially in its support for the entertainment industry, infrastructural development and the empowerment of the citizenry to mention just a few remains quite impressive especially when juxtaposed with the fact that Lagos is today the fifth largest economy in Africa and a global mega city needing the visionary leadership of an astute administrator like the Lagos State Governor. According to Edgar, who is also an investment banker, the play which will be staged at the prestigious Muson Centre will dazzle Lagosians’ with some of the most scintillating and excitingly titillating performances by some of the most iconic thespians led by legendary actor and TV presenter, Yemi Shodimu. “The play was performed last year to an uproarious reception with thousands of Lagosians’ trooping out over six shows to watch the spectacle which left the audiences massively entertained as it took them through the intrigues and drama that was 14th century, Lagos,” he said. He also revealed that a twist has been added to the story as, ‘Ambode’ is expected to appear on stage for a three minute Cameo that would see him take the Lead Actress from the 14th century on a tour of modern Lagos, showing her key socio economic developmental projects thereby further selling his vison to the people of Lagos. Theatre remains a very strong vehicle for social mobilization and cohesion. The play would premiere on June 12 to a massive discount in ticket sales to all Lagos State Civil servants and lovers of democracy in celebration of the governor’s birthday.
