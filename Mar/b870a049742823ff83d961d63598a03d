Former Golden Eaglets Coach, Emmanuel Amuneke has hailed the tactical awareness of Al Khartoum Watani players’ following their third away victory of the season in the Sudanese Premier League. The in-form Al Khartoum who narrowly lost to Al Hilal on Sunday bounced back with a hard fought 1-0 win over Al Wadi Nyala courtesy a 42nd minute goal from Musa. Before Sunday’s victory, Al Khartoum had defeated Kober and Merreikh Kosti 2-1 and 1-0 away from home respectively. ‘We played a very good side,’ Amuneke told SportingLife from his base in Sudan. ‘We knew that they are a team you cannot allow to play when they’ve the ball. ‘Tactically we were organized as a team. Mostly, when we lose the ball, we try as much as possible not to allow them play comfortably.’ Al Khartoum now moves into fourth with 11points from seven matches so far this season.
