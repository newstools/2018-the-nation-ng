Some members  of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from the 18 local government areas of Ondo State have defected to the Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN). They were led by Ekundayo Akinola from Ese-Odo Local Government and Emiloju Akinmola from Irele Council. Receiving the new members at its secretariat on Hospital Road, Akure, the state capital, the chairman, Prince Adesanya Olaoluwa, said the party has good programmes for the people. He urged members to intensify the membership drive in their various units and wards to guarantee victory for the party in future elections. He also advise them to collect their  the Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). Olaoluwa hailed the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for granting the party’s request to change the name of the defunct Mega Progressives Peoples Party (MPPP) to Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN). He said: ”The new certificate of MPN was given to our national chairman. The leaders of those who wanted to hijack the party is also a factional chairman of a notable political party in the state. “We note that he is still in this particular party and this is anti-party activity when you have not resigned from one party and you are still claiming to be the chairman of another rival party.” “When Obasanjo’s third force and coalition was launched in Akure, Ondo State, this same person attended as the factional chairman of his party. The MPN Chairman lamented the activities of those negotiating to pull out of the party to weaken the platform. Olaoluwa urged the peopple not to give them recognition as members of the MPN. He said the party has  people-oriented programmes for the people.
