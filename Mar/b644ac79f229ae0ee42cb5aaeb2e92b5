In a  suit filed yesterday by his counsel Mr Olukoya Ogungbeje, Evans is asking for N1 billion as “general and exemplary damages for the alleged forceful seizure of the property and other items without a court order.” The applicant is also seeking N4 million as cost of action against   Inspector-General of Police (IGP), the police, IGP Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) Abba Kyari and Deputy Superintendent Phillip Rieninwa. No date has been fixed for the hearing. Some of the items include N50 million cash, two residential duplexes, a Brigade wrist-watch valued at $170,000, a phone worth $30,000 and five pieces of Saphono Rucci Diamond rings worth $100,000. Others are three Italian travel bags worth $55,000, 10 Spanish shoes each worth N2.5 million, 20 KVA inverter set worth N10 million, two sets of dining table worth N8 million. He is seeking a declaration that the  forcible seizure and sealing of his property without any court order is illegal, wrongful and unconstitutional. The plaintiff is also praying for an order compelling the respondents jointly and severally to immediately and unconditionally release the properties as well as to immediately and unconditionally unseal and vacate the his two  houses located at Magodo in Lagos.
