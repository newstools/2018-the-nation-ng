Obat Oil and Petroleum Ltd. has just entered into a long-term agreement with Vital Allied Energy Supply & Services Ltd, (VAE) to supply 100,000mt of refined product quarterly, with a delivery of 30,000mt monthly. The first tranche of AGO cargo arrived at the Obat terminal in Apapa, within the week and loading activities commenced immediately, upon the discharge of the product into tanks. In view of the high demand for the use of the product in the market, plans are already in progress by VAE, to further increase the monthly volume to meet up with the market demand. The agreement between the two companies is to further strengthen the market supply of AGO and other petroleum products. However, in order to actualize the supply chain mechanism, Obat Oil, in conjunction with its arm of the NUPENG and Petroleum Tanker Drivers (PTD) entered into a Memorandum of UnderstandingÂ  with VAE to ensure the smooth delivery of the products across the country.
