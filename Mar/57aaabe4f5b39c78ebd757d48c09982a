Contrary to reports that the Imo State Deputy Governor, Eze Madumere has absconded from his office over alleged security threat, The Nation investigations revealed that the deputy governor is still in his office carrying out his constitutional duties. When our correspondent visited his office off Orlu road, the deputy governor was said to have driven away for a field job somewhere in the state. The Chief Press Secretary to the Deputy Governor, Mr. Uche Onwuchekwa, described the said report published in one of the national dailies, as unfounded and misleading. He stated that his principal comes to his office at the Government House on daily basis and still engages in field duties any time the need arises. According to him, “the deputy governor has not fled and will not flee from his office. The said report is a mere imagination of the author and does not in any way reflect the situation on ground. The Deputy Governor is elected and cannot be intimidated to abandon his office or constitutional duties”.
