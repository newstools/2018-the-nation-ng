The Organised Private Sector (OPS) and oil marketers have faulted the provision of a single regulator, the Nigerian Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NPRC) in the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill (PIGB) by the National Assembly. They spoke jointly to reporters in Lagos yesterday. While  the OPS was represented by its Chairman, Economic Policy Committee, Manufacturers Association of Nigeria (MAN), Mr. Odiah Reginald Odiah, the Major Oil Marketers Association of Nigeria (MOMAN) was represented by its Executive Secretary, Mr. Obafemi Olawore. The Depot and Petroleum Products Marketers Association of Nigeria (DAPPMAN) was also represented by its Executive Secretary, Mr. Olufemi Adewole. The groups told reporters that they have carefully gone through the PIGB and noted the provision of a single regulator in the bill would be counter-productive and keep Nigerians and the economy in same problems we experience today in the oil and gas industry. They say it has become imperative to point out the problem before the bill gets presidential assent because they learnt the National Assembly has harmonised their positions on it. Creating one regulator for the upstream and downstream sectors of the industry will be too big and the regulator will become ineffective, they argued. They groups said: “We need the National Assembly to create two regulatory bodies or agencies that will be independent, one for the upstream and one the downstream.” At the beginning of Nigeria’s oil industry, it was only one regulator that existed, the Department of Petroleum Resources, and it was not able to properly and efficiently regulate the industry, hence the creation of the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) and the Petroleum Equalisation Fund (PEF).
