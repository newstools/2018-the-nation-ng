The  Lagos State Chapter of the Nigeria Inter-Religious Council (NIREC) yesterday stressed the need to deepen religious harmony in the state. They also endorsed Governor Akinwunmi Ambode for a second term in office. The clerics spoke at the first quarterly meeting of religious leaders and faith-based organisations in Alausa. NIREC Lagos State Chapter Chairman Dr Tajudeen Yusuf said the endorsement was in recognition of the modest efforts of Ambode in infrastructural development and the maintenance of peace in Lagos. According to Yusuf, Ambode’s approval of the existence of NIREC, not only at state level, but across the 57 local government and local councils development areas of the state, has ensured that issues capable of triggering religious crisis in Lagos, are nib in the bud. The religious leader observed that the Boko Haram’s crisis in the northwest could have been avoided had NIREC at the national lived up to expectation. He assured that religious bodies would rally around Ambode to actualise his second term ambition, adding “one good term deserves another”. His co-chairman Alexander Bamgbola, who doubles as Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) Chairman said Lagos is a state that enjoys the special grace of God.  Bamgbola, who described Ambode as a listening governor, called for the support of the government to enable it do more. Commissioner for Home Affairs Dr Abul-Hakeem Abdul-Lateef urged the religious leaders to use the pulpits to preach love and encourage their followers to support policies aimed at improving the welfare of all. According to the Abdul-Lateef, while NIREC at the national level has been unable to function effectively, Lagos has continued to show example of how Christians, Muslims and other beliefs should co-exist. The commissioner thanked the religious leaders for endorsing Ambode. He assured that the state government would continue to ensure that Lagos continues to stand out.
