Barely a week after the Abuja Bureau Chief of Daily Independent, Tony Ezimakor was released unconditionally by the men of Department of State Services (DSS), Musa Krishi, a senior House of Representatives reporter with Daily Trust was whisked away in a commando style to Kano by men of Zone I command of the Nigeria Police Force (NPF). It was a mixture of confusion and fear among journalists and workers of the National Assembly when news filtered out over the manner Krishi was picked up by the police. According to police sources, Krishi was alleged to have written a defamatory report against Governor of Jigawa state. It was however gathered that the problem might be over an advertorial ran by Daily Trust but sourced by Krishi. When journalists covering the House approached the police post in the National Assembly, they were told the authority for the invitation of the reporter was from Zone 1 Command through the Abuja Command which directed NASS post to comply with the directives. “When they (Kano Command officers) came, I think they were taken to the Clerk of the National Assembly  (CNA), who gave the go ahead to carry on with their duty”, a police source who wished not to be named told The Nation. However, rather than being taken to the Area 10 office of Force Criminal Investigation Department (FCID), Krishi was being taken to Kano, it was gathered. When contacted, Daily Trust confirmed that it was aware of the development and has swung into action.
