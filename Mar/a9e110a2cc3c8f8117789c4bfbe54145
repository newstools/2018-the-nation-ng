 A German football fan has been arrested for allegedly masturbating in a stadium on match day. The Hertha Berlin follower was filmed relieving his frustrations before Saturday’s 1-0 loss to Schalke. Images appeared on social media of the man, in his 20s, sprawled on the away terraces with his jeans lowered – and his hand making a seemingly rude action. He is then seen to be surrounded by a group of stewards, while other Hertha fans stand nearby apparently unconcerned. The man was ejected from Schalke’s Veltins Arena and was reportedly arrested after a struggle with police. He now faces indecency and assault charges.  Schalke’s Marko Pjaca scored the only goal of the match to give hand his team the victory. Recently a Brooklyn woman headed home after a long night at work ended up getting into a tussle and stabbing a man who had been masturbating in front of her on the subway. The unidentified victim, who works as a director of events at a hotel, fell asleep on the Bay Ridge-bound R train around 2am, When she woke up the woman said she saw a man staring at her as he masturbated, police said. The 42-year-old woman screamed but instead of fleeing the pervert, identified as 47-year-old Reggie Frank, pulled out a switchblade and canister of pepper spray and doused the woman in her face. Reggie Frank, 57, was arrested and charged for masturbating in front of a woman on a Brooklyn-bound train. The attacker then lunged at the woman allegedly cutting her on her left hand and a fight ensued, according to the New York Post. The tussle spilled onto the platform at the 36 St. Stations in Sunset Park. Witnesses told police that the woman was able to wrestle the knife from her attacker and stab him in the chest and arm.
