The Social Advocacy Project (SAP) of Al-Mu’minaat and Muslim Students’ Society of Nigeria (MSSN) yesterday urged Federal Government to ensure adequate security measures are in place to prevent a similar occurrence. “Our hearts are really gladdened when news broke in the early hours of today (yesterday) that one hundred and one (101) of the abducted Dapchi girls have been released by the Boko Haram. They urged government not to relent on the war against terror and the “killer herdsmen.” SAP Coordinator Sherifah Yusuf-Ajibade said the PMB-led government cannot afford to relax on securing lives and property of Nigerians. Mrs Yusuf-Ajibade said: “We are using this medium to call for the release of the remaining Chibok and Dapchi girls. The intelligence that led to the release should be kept and not breached so that the remaining girls can come back alive and safe. “Stories of how girls have concluded that they won’t return to school get to us daily. Once beaten twice shy. No one can blame parents or even girls who concluded that school isn’t safe for them. Experience has taught them and nothing better that experience. This is one of the very important reasons why our government cannot afford to relent on ensuring security at schools. “Girl-Child education and women empowerment is at stake. If this apathy isn’t addressed, then the future of women, family may be affected negatively.” MSSN Lagos State President Dr Saheed Ashafa appealed that security should be tightened in all schools across the country, adding that attention should be paid to the medical and mental state of the released girls. The provision of a safe environment for education is very crucial and germane to the nation’s progress, he said. “Situations, whereby students are exposed to various degrees of security threats, are unacceptable. Government at all levels must deploy quality resources to address the issue of security pitfalls in schools and our country as a whole,” he said.
