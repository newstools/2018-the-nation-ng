RESIDENTS of Makoko, a slum community near Yaba, Lagos Mainland, have appealed to the state government to  dredge their canal to check flooding. The canal, they said, also serves Ebute-Meta, Sabo and Yaba. The Makoko Community Day  Organising Committee Chairman, Chief Kayode Bamidele, said if the canal is not dredged ‘’our roads will be destroyed by flood when it rains’’. He  called for the construction of a bridge to link Adams Manuel Street in Makoko with Ishola Street at Alagomeji so as to ease movement and  link them to  other areas. The communitY, he said,  also needed a health centre and a secondary school. “We travel to other communities for healthcare services and our children have to go to other communities, travelling miles and taking the risk of crossing the express roads every day to go to school,” he said. Bamidele said Makoko Day  was aimed at showcasing the community’s diverse cultural heritage. Makoko Community President Alhaji Odetunde Mudashiru said the   celebration would foster peaceful co-existence in the community. “We also give gifts, encourage the young ones and make them to know what the community stands for. The programme will ensure togetherness among our people.  We also use this medium to plead with government on our needs in the community,” he said.
