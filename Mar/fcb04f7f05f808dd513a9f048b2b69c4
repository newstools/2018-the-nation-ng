After scoring a big point with the hosting of the inaugural edition of the Africa Junior Athletics Championship in Warri, Delta State is set for another big mark this time with the leading Africa Senior Athletics Championships. According to the Chairman of the Local Organizing Committee of Asaba 2018 African Senior Athletics Championships, Solomon Ogba, a record attendance is expected at the event.

The LOC will be sponsoring two athletes from all the countries so you can be sure that everybody will be present,” the former president of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria assured. Ogba who played a key role in the successful hosting of first Africa Youth Championships, which has served as a template in subsequent editions, disclosed that the aim is to also make Asaba 2018 the best ever in the history of the Africa Senior Athletics Championships. “We want to set a new standard as far as the Africa Senior Athletics Championships is concerned, the goal is to make this edition as glamorous as the World Championships itself,” Ogba stressed.
