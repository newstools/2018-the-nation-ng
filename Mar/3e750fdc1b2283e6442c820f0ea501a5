A front-line educationist and Executive Chairman of the pioneer private polytechnic in Nigeria, The Polytechnic, Ile-Ife, Dr Ramon Adedoyin has advocated the outright scrapping of the Higher National Diploma (HND) programme and replacement with bachelor’s degree in Technology as obtained in advanced nations of the world. Adedoyin was speaking against the backdrop of the removal of the dichotomy between the holders of Higher National Diploma and university degree holders by the federal government recently as announced by the Permanent Secretary, Service, Policies and Strategies Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Mr Ndubuisi Osuji recently at the 40th National Council on Establishment held in Owerri. Adedoyin who stated this while fielding questions from journalists noted that though the removal of the disparity between HND and university degree was a welcome idea, what the federal government ought to do is change all existing Polytechnics to degree awarding institutions by directing all polytechnics to affiliate with existing universities and such universities should admit products of the polytechnics into their 300 level for B.Tech, B.A or B.Sc programmes. He described the present HND programme as archaic and outdated which according to him is why advance countries like the United States and Britain after whom the Nigerian educational system is fashioned have jettisoned the programme long time ago in favour of Bachelor’s degree in Technology.
