 Slow  pace of work at the Samara Stadium one of the venues of this year’s world cup, is giving soccer ruling body FIFA goose pimples .  FIFA revealed this on Wednesday, noting that huge amount of work still needs to be done to get the venue ready ahead of the kick off on June 14. African representatives Senegal will be confronting Colombia at the venue on June 28. Other matches slated for the venue include Costa Rica against Serbia, Demark versus Australia and Uruguay versus hosts Russia. Construction work at the 45,000 capacity Samara Arena has been hit by a number of setbacks in recent months, putting authorities under additional pressure to deliver a proper venue for the tournament. ‘Over the course of this project, we have spoken about delays in Samara,’ FIFA Chief Competitions and Events Officer Colin Smith told reporters at the venue. ‘Those delays are still evident now even though… a lot of progress has been made. There is a huge amount of work to be done.’ Smith said the ‘full support and commitment’ of Russian authorities and the venue’s contractor were essential for the venue to be commissioned by the end of April as had been originally planned. ‘We would expect further progress than this,’ Smith said. ‘But what’s important to us is that the stadium is commissioned on time, then we have the use of the stadium and we can install all our temporary overlay and equipment that we need for the World Cup.’ Sports Minister Pavel Kolobkov said last year that the authorities were monitoring the troubled stadium’s construction and had set up a timetable to track progress and compensate for delays.
