In a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, the President said: “From the very time we came until now, we have been able to do our best and we remain focused on delivering on our promises.” He told the Saudi Arabian delegation that the priority of his administration had so far been on securing the country, buoying the economy and curbing corruption so that Nigerians would start benefitting from their rich natural and human resources. The President expressed appreciation to the King Salman Aid and Relief Centre and the Saudi Development Fund for providing relief materials, worth 10 million dollars, to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the North East. In his remarks, the Minister of Defence, Mohammed Dan-Ali said the delegation from Saudi Arabia had already visited the Ministry of Defence, Defence Headquarters and taken a tour of IDP camps in Maiduguri as part of their schedule. The Leader of the Saudi Arabian delegation from King Salman, Nasser Bin Mutlaq, said the visit and the donation of materials was an extension of the good relations both countries had shared over the years.
