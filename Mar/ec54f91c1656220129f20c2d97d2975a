There are still chances of the Super Eagles of Nigeria going to the World Cup with some players who have not been a part of the set up since the appointment of coach Gernot Rohr. On Thursday the coach released his list of players for the games against Poland and Serbia respectively, and in the list he handed call ups to four new players who have not tasted action under his guide. Al-Ahly Junior Ajayi, Torino of Italy Joel Obi, Stephen Eze of Lokomotiv Plovdiv and Gabriel Okechukwu of Akwa United were named for the first time by Rohr in the 28-man. According to the coach, there could be more new faces in the team in subsequent games, because he intends to make the team competitive to bring out the best in his favoured players. ”We must keep the door always open for new players because if we say we already have our players there’s no competition and it’s not good for the level of all the teams”, the coach said.
