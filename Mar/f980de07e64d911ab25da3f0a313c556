L iverpool wants to sign Leicester City workaholic midfielder Wilfred Ndidi in the summer to replace departing Emre Can at Anfield. The 21-year-old Nigeria international is linked to Merseyside with the German midfielder set to move away from the Reds at the end of his contract, however, Jurgen Klopp is said to be assessing a number of potential replacements for Can. Ndidi has become one of the key figures since he joined the former Premier League Champions Leicester from Belguim outfit Genk in January 2017. However, Guinean journalist Alpha Balde said Liverpool have already approached Super Eagles star over a possible switch in the summer, adding that the midfielder has already agreed but Leicester are likely to demand a big fee for a player who has impressed in his first 14 months at the King Power Stadium. Leicester boss Claude Puel has previously said that he has ‘no issues’ with Ndidi being linked to a bigger club in England’s top flight. Former Genk star has featured 29 times in all competition for the Foxes this season scoring four goals in the process.
