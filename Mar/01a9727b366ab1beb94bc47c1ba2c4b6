While in a discussion with fellow Housemate, Rico Swavey, Cee-C admitted to being beaten up severally by her parents whenever she acted any playlet or drama scene in her childhood. “I have always been like this; I have always been dramatic,” She stated. Cee-C told Rico that her best moment was quitting her job at the law firm and settling for acting. According to her, her life has been better ever since and it didn’t take her much time to achieve the stardom she so desired. While Rico blamed circumstances as obstacles that can stop one from identifying their specific talent in time; Cee-C believed that many Parents did not do enough to push their children towards their dreams. “We need to be better parents than the ones before us. Our parents didn’t do well. The best thing that can ever happen is for a child to be supported by their parents. I was beaten for acting Drama,” Cee-C said. She finally urged parents to support their children immensely. “Do all you can for the well being of your child. We can’t understand things as children, only parents can. Do well to support your children in achieving their dreams,” She advised.
