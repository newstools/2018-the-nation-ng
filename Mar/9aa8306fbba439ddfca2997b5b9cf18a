 A personal trainer who allowed his hands to wonder beyond limit in the course of massaging women has been jailed after three women came forward to report sexual assault Iranian Mohsen Dastvard, 37, abused his victims when he should have been giving them sports massages. The pervert rubbed one woman’s breasts, rubbed oil on another victim’s bum, and touched the third woman’s breasts, bum and inner thigh during several massages. But he was arrested after one of the women went to the police and the other two victims later came forward. Now the former national and world champion kick-boxer – who fights under the name Siavash Dastvard – has been jailed for four years and three months at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court – and will be deported when he is released from prison. The court heard Dastvard told one victim that he gave Thai massages. Prosecutor Peter McCartney said: ‘She went in the room with him. He told her to lie down. She was expecting him to massage her back but he touched her bum.’ Dastvard, of Baird Court, Burslem, pleaded guilty to assault by penetration and two offences of sexual assault. Anis Ali, mitigating, said the defendant – who came to this country in 2013 and was granted political asylum – is embarrassed and ashamed. He lost his job as a result of the incidents and gained alternative work as a labourer. Mr Ali said: ‘The offences were committed against a background of stupidity. He was not thinking straight.’ Judge Paul Glenn told former firefighter Dastvard: ‘I reject entirely that these offences were not sexually motivated. What else could they be? ‘There were three separate complainants. Two were repeat victims. We are not talking of a one-off. These were very unpleasant experiences for the victims and deeply embarrassing. I am sure they will have some psychological effect.’ Dastvard will be on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely and has been barred from a range of activities involving children and vulnerable adults.
