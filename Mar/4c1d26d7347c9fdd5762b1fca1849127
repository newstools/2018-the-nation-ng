A French police officer who swapped himself for a hostage in a supermarket siege on Friday has died. Lt-Col. Arnaud Beltrame, 45, “fell as a hero” and showed “exceptional courage,” French President, Emmanuel Macron, said. The gendarme helped bring an end to a gunman’s shooting spree that killed three in southern France, the BBC reports. The radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was shot dead as police brought the siege to an end. Earlier, Mr. Macron had revealed that Lt-Col Beltrame had suffered serious injuries and was fighting for his life in hospital. At least 16 people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr. Macron called an act of “Islamist terrorism.” Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the November 13, 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. One person – believed to be Lakdim’s partner – has been arrested in connection with the shootings. Announcing the police officer’s death on Twitter, Interior Minister, Gérard Collomb said: “He died for his country. France will never forget his heroism, his bravery, his sacrifice.”
