President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday received the FIFA World Cup trophy at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The trophy is presently touring 91 cities in 51 countries across the globe ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup competition billed for Russia in June. Apart from thanking the world football ruling body, FIFA for allowing the trophy to tour two cities in Nigeria, Abuja and Lagos, President Buhari promised to support the Super Eagles towards winning the trophy in June. He was glad that the Super Eagles was the first African team to qualify for the 2018 World Cup. According to him, football has been a great unifying factor among the ethnic groups in the country. Even as no cash reward was announced at the short ceremony for the CHAN Eagles that won silver in Morocco, the President said that the country appreciated their efforts. “We are proud of you and the team to the Bobsleigh Winter Olympics in South Korea.” He said While commending Coca-Cola for their role in football development in Nigeria, he urged other organizations to emulate the company.
The Sports Minister, Solomon Dalung, disclosed that the two ladies that brought honours to Nigeria at the Bobsleigh Winter Olympics in South Korea, were based in the United States and sponsored their training and participation at the competition. He noted that the honours coming to Nigeria under the present administration won’t have been possible without the support of the President. FIFA representative, Christian Karembeu who presented the FIFA World Cup trophy to President Buhari, urged the Super Eagles to believe in themselves in order to go far in the competition. The President of Coca Cola West Africa, Peter Njonjo, hoped that the ceremony on Wednesday would turn out to be a dress rehearsal for the return of the trophy in July if the Super Eagles wins the competition.
