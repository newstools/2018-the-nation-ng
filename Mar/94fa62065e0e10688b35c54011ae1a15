There was pandemonium yesterday at Ogolonto in Ikorodu,  Lagos, when a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) vehicle crushed a schoolboy. The late Ezekiel Daniel, a primary six pupil of Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Primary School, was on his way to school. It was gathered that he wanted to cross the BRT lane when the bus ran him over. His death sparked a protest as  other road users vandalised two BRT buses but were dispersed by security operatives. Those who commented on the accident on social media , blamed the boy’s death on the absence of a pedestrian bridge around Idiroko/Ogolonto road. They said there were more than six primary schools in that neighbourhood, with pupils at risk of being knocked down while attempting to cross the road. According to a witness, pupils usually crossed the road with the assistance of a man, who stood there in the mornings to stop vehicles for them. “But the man was not there and the child tried to cross by himself. The BRT knocked him down and ran him over. “Authorities should swing into action as soon as possible.  Moreso, a lasting solution should be provided to curb incessant BRT killings in that area. “This can be done by erecting a bridge to save pupils who cross that road every morning to school,” said a witness, Asoro Olatunji. Another resident, Ifeanyi Edmund said: “The question is why would you have schools without pedestrian crossing? What would it cost to mark a zebra crossing there so that vehicles would always slow down for pedestrians? We are our own problems in this country.” Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal said peace had been restored in the area. He said: “We went there and although people gathered, they were dispersed. Nothing was destroyed or burnt there. Normalcy has since been restored to the area.”
