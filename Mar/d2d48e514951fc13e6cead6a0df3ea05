Sterling Bank Plc has expressed its desire to partner with the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) in a bid to positively influence development in Nigeria’s transportation sector. Group Head, Strategy & Innovation, Sterling Bank Plc, Mr. Shina Atilola, stated this while addressing executive members of the Institute who paid a courtesy visit to the corporate headquarters of the lender at Marina, Lagos recently. He said the transportation sector is a major contributor to the economy and that “Without effective transportation, businesses will not attain their true potential because they will be denied the opportunity to connect with supply chain partners and customers. We recognise the important role the transportation sector has played and is playing in the growth and development of the Nigerian economy, hence our engagement with CILT.” Earlier in his remarks, Mr. Paul Ndibe, Acting National Executive Director of the institute, said the organisation started in 1919 in the United Kingdom while it became operational in Nigeria in 1958 and has been contributing in various ways to the development of logistics and transportation sector of the Nigerian economy. The visit was also to enable executive members of the institute to discuss how Sterling Bank could collaborate with it in the execution of the forum and for it to be branded as a friendly bank for the logistics and transport services providers. The African Forum with the theme “Building Capacity for Efficient Logistics & Transport Services in Africa” is scheduled to hold March 14th – 16th, 2018.
