RnB singer and actor, Banky W, who turned 37-year-old yesterday, got an epistle from his wife, actress Adesua Etomi. In her message to the singer, Adesua revealed that as a lover of rides, he is the best she had had in her life. She wrote on her Instagram handle; “Bubba, you know I love rides (rollercoaster rides, car rides, bike rides) and boy have I been on some amazing rides but life with you is by far the best ride I’ve ever been on. It’s a ride I never want to get off. “You make me better and coming home to you every day is one of the greatest blessings of my life. Your heart is unmatched. Your love makes everyday a beautiful day. I am by far the luckiest woman in the world. I love you soooo much sometimes I feel like my heart is going to burst open. “I celebrate you today and I hope I make you feel as special and as loved as you always make me feel. I am so blessed to call you my husband and in 50 years, may we be cute, wrinkly, have great dentition, be in great health and deeper in love. I look forward to dancing with you like this forever, surrounded by God’s peace and love. “As the mountains surround Jerusalem, may the Lord surround you now and forever. May he continue to announce you to the world, may he bless all the work of your hands, and may he make you a channel of blessings. A city set upon a hill cannot be hidden; I declare that your glory shall never be hidden. I speak God’s favour into every area of your life. May the good lord continue to light your path in Jesus name. Happy birthday baby. Words will never be enough.” The couple got married on Nov 25, 2017 in Cape Town, South Africa.
