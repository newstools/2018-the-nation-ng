The Divisional Police Officer in-charge of Ogidi Division, Mr. Mark Ijarafu, who confirmed the incident, told The Nation yesterday that the suspect had been arrested. He said investigation was on. Ijarafu noted that the suspect had no mental problems, “although neighbours said he smokes Indian hemp.” It was learnt that trouble started on the day about 8am when the man, a commercial motorcyclist (okada rider), demanded money from his father to buy a new motorcycle, since, according to him, the one he was using had become old. Our source said his father told him that he had no money, since he had just bought him a new engine to replace the old one in the motorcycle. The source said the suspect did not like his father’s response. He went to the kitchen, took a knife, which he used to stab his father to death. The eyewitness said the suspect also attacked his mother, who screamed for help. He added: “The woman reportedly fell down. The suspect thought she had died and in a bid to escape punishment, he tried to commit suicide by stabbing himself in the chest. “The woman shouted for help and this attracted passers-by and neighbours, who alerted a vigilance group and the Ogidi Divisional Police Officer, Mr. Ijarafu, who went to the scene with his Divisional Crime Officer, Mr. Fidelis Eyisi.” The suspect confessed: “I did what my spirit told me to do.” Ijarafu said the body had been taken to Iyi-Enu Mission Hospital mortuary in Ogidi, while the woman had been hospitalised. He added: “The suspect is in our detention. Investigation is on. He will be arraigned after investigation.”
