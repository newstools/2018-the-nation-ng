The Vice Chancellor of the Osun State University, Osogbo, Osun State, (UNIOSUN) Professor Labode Popoola has said that any of the staff of the university who join the ongoing strike by Non Academic Staff Union of Universities (NASU), will not be paid for the period of the strike. Briefing newsmen over the strike, the Vice Chancellor noted that he had met with workers several times on the issue and others and made the financial position of the university known to them adding that non-academic unions members are not the only body affected. Popoola who blamed the inability of the university to pay the money on paucity of funds noted that despite the financial situation of the university, salaries were paid promptly, a situation he said does not obtain in most state universities across the country. According to him, the university is being funded through the Internally Generated Revenue, the bulk of which comes from the fees paid by students adding that other sources that are expected to contribute to the funding of the university are not doing so because of lack of fund. The Vice Chancellor who said the university authorities have resolved to adopt the ‘no work no pay’ rule on adamant workers said attendance register had already been opened for workers to ensure that workers to go back to work. Popoola called on eminent citizens of the state, parents and guardians, students and well wishers to help prevail on the workers to return to work and give the University peace to move on in the interest of the students and service to humanity. The Vice chancellor expressed surprise that the workers are not appreciative of receiving their full salaries.
