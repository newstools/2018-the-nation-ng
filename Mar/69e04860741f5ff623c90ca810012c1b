The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Imo State yesterday described one Okere Uzochukwu, who took the party to court over the extension of the tenure National Working Committee (NWC) as an impostor. Okere, who claimed to be an aspirant for the chairmanship position in Imo APC, also joined the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the suit number FHC/A6J/CS/219/2018, praying the Court to quash the extension. A statement by the Chief Press Secretary to the Imo State governor, Sam Onwuemeodo, reads: “We start our reaction by stating that Okere Uzochukwu is not a registered member of APC in Imo State. “We have done our checks and could not locate such name in our official membership registers. “It is now left for Mr. Okere Uzochukwu to mention his ward, his registration number and show his membership card. “His case would also help the party to expose some untrustworthy politicians who crawled into Imo APC and have been playing their usual hide and seek game.” The statement added: “The truth is that no genuine member of the party could wake up one morning and take the party and its National leadership to court without clearance from the leader of the party in the state or clearance from the State exco of the Party. “He is an impostor and does not have the support of APC members in the State in his action, especially when he is not a member of the party and since Imo APC is not against the tenure extension for John Oyegun-led NWC. “The APC governors Forum, which the Imo governor chairs had pressed that the extension of tenure be made across the board in which the State, Local Government and Ward Officers of the Party would benefit from the exercise and that was done. “There is therefore no reason to warrant any Court action since the extension was done in good faith. “The leader of the party in Imo, Owelle Rochas Okorocha and the party, its executives and Stakeholders in the State dissociate themselves from the court action.”
