aMny residents of Oshodi have praised the Lagos State Government for clearing the area of beggars and destitute. Officials of the Ministry of Youth and Social Development swooped on the area and arrested about 43 beggars at different places in Oshodi and  environs. A resident of Mafoluku, Sikiru Babatunde said the activities of beggars in Oshodi had become worrisome, adding that some of them were often seen harassing people and insulting those who did not give them  alms. Besides, he said the beggars contributed to  abuse of the environment. “They litter the environment with all manners of trash and dirt. Apart from these, some of them also defecate and urinate indiscriminately on roads, median and other public places,” he said. Another resident  said they were afraid that the destitute’s activities could  pose ‘’great security risk’’ to residents. Commissioner for Youth and Social Development Agboola Dabiri said the exercise would continue  until  every part of Lagos was liberated from the menace of beggars, miscreants and destitute.
