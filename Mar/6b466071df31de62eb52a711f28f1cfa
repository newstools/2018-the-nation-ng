Mr Makinde Ogunleye, a former Chairman of the Nigeria Institute of Town Planners ( NITP ) Lagos State Chapter, on Tuesday urged governments at all levels, including citizens, to prioritise infrastructure maintenance. Ogunleye told our reporter,  in Lagos that lack of maintenance and sustainability culture among Nigerians was the bane of infrastructure development. He said that the housing and infrastructure development in Nigeria should have developed better than its current stage, if the country made maintenance of existing infrastructure a priority. According to him, lots of infrastructure and abandoned projects have been allowed to decay, due to lack of adequate maintenance. Ogunleye suggested that the government and the citizens should make maintenance of existing infrastructure a priority, if the development of such facility was to be improved upon. “It is when one learns to protect and sustain what he/she has, that he can be able to grow it. “Until Nigerians imbibe the maintenance culture, the country may not be able to improve its infrastructure status,” he said. According to him, the country has got diverse infrastructure and capital projects, but lacks the ability to monitor, maintain and sustain them. “Generally, we believed in new projects,  which is good, but what matters is their sustenance. “The governments have performed well by developing the existing infrastructure and other capital projects, but it failed in their maintenance. “For instance, the Bus Rapid Transit ( BRT ) which was introduced in Lagos about 10 years ago, was not given adequate maintenance. “And that is why we are unable to sustain it; today, large number of the transit buses are parked because they can no longer function well,” he said. Ogunleye noted that the nation’s construction sector would have recorded remarkable growth if all the projects embarked opon in the past were completed and sustained. NAN
