Former Minister of Science and Technology Dr. Bode Olowoporoku has described the construction of N14.5 billion flyover by Governor Ayo Fayose as a “misplacement of priority.” Olowoporoku, who spoke in his Ilawe-Ekiti country home after hosting his supporters, said the multi billion naira flyover could not be justified, amidst “acute and unprecedented hunger in the state.” He said the money spent on the construction of the bridge should have been ploughed into agriculture, tourism and investment in human capital. The former senator, who represented Ekiti South District between 2003 and 2007, has signified intent to run for the governor on the platform of Mega Party of Nigeria (MPN). He expressed concern that many people in Ekiti go to bed hungry promising that an MPN government would make food available to them if voted into power. Olowoporoku explained that the fight against hunger, poverty and unemployment would be a cardinal policy of his administration if elected governor. The veteran politician explained that he would tackle the problems with huge investment in agriculture with a policy he described as the “Agric Revolution.”
