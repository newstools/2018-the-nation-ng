The new Russian hypersonic aviation and missile system dubbed Kinzhal (Dagger) has been successfully tested and deployed to the south of the country, President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday. “The creation of the high-precision hypersonic aviation and missile system, which has no analogues in the world, is very important. “Its tests have successfully been concluded. Moreover, since Dec. 1, 2017, the system has been on the mission at the airfields of the South military district,” Putin said during his annual address to the parliament. The unique characteristics of the high-speed carrier aircraft allow for delivering the missile within minutes, Putin continued. Putin said the missile, the speed of which exceeds the speed of the sound by 10 times, is able to overcome the existing and potentially-created air defence and anti-missile systems, reaching the target located up to 2,000 kilometers (1,242 miles) away with ordinary and nuclear warheads. “The creation of the strategic missile system with the essentially new military equipment, which is the maneuvering winged unit, the tests of which have already been completed, is a true technological breakthrough,” Putin pointed out. He said the work to strengthen Russia’s defence capability is carried out within the framework of international agreements. “For my part, I will note that all work to strengthen Russia’s defense capability has been carried out within the framework of existing arms control agreements. We do not violate anything,” Putin said. He said it took other countries centuries to achieve what Russia has achieved over the past 30 years.
