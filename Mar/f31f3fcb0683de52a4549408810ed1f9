Former Governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, on Tuesday urged President Muhammadu Buhari to arrest former President Obasanjo Obasanjo over the $16 billion electricity scam. He said although President Buhari has the guts to fight corruption, he must prove to Nigerians that he is truly fighting corruption by arresting Obasanjo. Kalu, who boasted to be a wealth creator, said he is stronger than President Buhari at fighting corruption and would return Nigeria’s money to the people if he was in the position to do so. The former governor spoke at a public lecture titled: “Culture, Economy and Good governance: The Nigerian Experience,” organised by the Nigerian Institute for Cultural Orientation (NICO). He condemned state governors for not being creators of wealth but instead rush to Abuja every month to share oil money without knowing what it takes to make money. He said: “I call on every aspect of our society for people to invest more on our cultural relationship with others, culture can be a lot, when you go to Calabar to Badagry towards the Atlantic Ocean. We don’t need to do any other job, we don’t even need crude oil, I can develop this economy without crude oil, crude oil is secondary. “With our population and intellectual capacity crude oil is a curse to the country, that is the truth. Because it is keeping us backwards, we can make money from things.”
