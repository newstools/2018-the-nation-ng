An Ikeja Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded the treasurer of Omole Phase 2 Residential Community Development Association (CDA), Lekan Somorin, in prison custody for an alleged N9.5 million theft. The defendant will remain in Kirikiri Medium Security Prisons until he perfects his bail conditions. The police arraigned Somorin, 52, yesterday before Magistrate Bola Osunsanmi. Somorin, who lives at Omole Phase 2, Olowora, Lagos, is facing a two-count charge of forgery and theft. Prosecuting Inspector Benson Emuerhi told the court that the defendant  stole the money and falsified the association’s account records. He said the defendant committed the offences between March 2016 and November 2017 at Omole Phase 2 Residential Association C.D.A office, Lagos. “When he was asked about the N9.5 million, he could not give any satisfactory explanation on how the money got missing. “All efforts made by the complainant to get the accused to refund the money proved abortive,” he said. The defendant  pleaded not guilty. Magistrate Osunsanmi granted him N1 million bail with two sureties in the like sum. Somorin’s trial begins on May 31.
