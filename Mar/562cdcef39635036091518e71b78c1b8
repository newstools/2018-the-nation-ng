The management of the Federal Polytechnic, Auchi, Edo State, has expelled 18 students and rusticated 62 others for misconduct during the 2016/2017 academic session. The Rector of institution, Dr. Sanusi Jimah, disclosed this at the 36th matriculation ceremony for 11,173 students admitted into the institution for the 2017/2018 session. Dr. Jimah warned the new students that anybody that used fake credentials to gain admission into the polytechnic would be fished out. He said the institution has zero tolerance for social vices, adding that the management would not hesitate to expel any student found wanting. The Rector said: “All the credentials you presented during the registration process would be verified. If the credentials are found to be fake; the penalty is expulsion from the polytechnic. “You have come into this institution at a time that management is on a transformation mission. “This transformation agenda is directed at ensuring that corrupt practices are eliminated in the conduct of academic and all other transactions in the polytechnic. “The management of the polytechnic is coming down hard on staff who extort money from students to enhance their examination grades or request amorous gratifications to pass students.”
