He stated that over hundred had been arrested for contravening the law, stressing that assurances had also been given by security agents to help enforce implementation of the ranching law. The Governor said Fulani herdsmen who were causing insecurity in the country were enemies of the APC and all Nigerians, even as he called for the arrest and prosecution of leaders of Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore and other Fulani leaders for their inflammatory statements Governor Ortom acknowledged the support of the party to his administration especially at its trying moment, assuring that he would not betray the confidence it had reposed in him. He tasked the APC on the rule of law, respect for the party’s constitution and the use of dialogue in addressing issues including primaries, saying doing so would reduce acrimony among party members and their supporters. The Governor also told the party’s working committee that issues of irregular payment of salaries were being addressed with improved federal allocation to states. He officially broke the news of the visit of President Muhammadu Buhari to Benue next Monday to commiserate with people of the state over herdsmen attacks and massacre of Benue people.
