Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr has said that any goalkeeper that wants to make the Eagles final squad for this year’s World Cup must prove his worth. Rohr told NationSport that he has not told anyone or any medium the three goalkeepers that would go to Russia but assured that they all have equal opportunities to make the final squad. The coach said that he has very competent goalkeepers’ coaches that could help him in making his final decision on who eventually becomes Super Eagles number first choice goalkeeper, noting that the decision is yet to be taken. Speaking on the much publicised story accredited to him that the Deportivo La Coruna goalkeeper Francis Uzoho is not his first choice goalkeeper for the 2018 World Cup, Rohr has replied: “No, I did not say that he (Uzoho) is not my first choice. That doesn’t mean that he is my first choice. I said that he (Uzoho) is working hard. The first choice goalkeeper will announced just before the World Cup. “There is a fair competition for all our positions (in the team), Including the goalkeeping position. “I never told that to a radio station. Please tell your people to be cautious about the information they consume,” a disappointed Rohr stated yesterday.
