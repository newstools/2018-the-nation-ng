Ogun State Governor Senator Ibikunle Amosun has said traditional institutions are symbols of sovereignty as well as the melting pot for communal efforts towards socio-economic development of communities. Amosun spoke at the installation and presentation of staff of office to Oba Clement Akinola Omosowon of the Orisanwo Ruling House as the new Elewo of Ilewo Orile. The ceremony was held at Ilewo Community High School, Ilewo-Orile in Abeokuta North Local Government Area. The governor, who was represented by the Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Chief Jide Ojuko, noted that apart from the fact that monarchs are custodians of traditions and cultural values of their domains, they also aggregate the collective aspirations of their people. He congratulated insigenes of Elewo community for maintaining peace and order after the demise of the last monarch, Oba Nathaniel Orisabiyi, on February 14, 2014. Amosun said the turnout of the residents was a demonstration of the unwavering commitment of his administration at providing leadership for every traditional institution, where vacancy existed. He added that his administration would continue to discharge its mandate, which is anchored on the five cardinal programmes, as enshrined in the Mission to Rebuild Ogun State. The governor said his administration would pay attention to education, health, agriculture and provide tight security needed for the socio-economic well-being of the residents. “Kabiyesi, you are expected to play the role of a father to all your subjects, including those who have contested the stoll with you. I urge you to also see your appointment as a clarion call to serve your people,” Amosun said. The chairman of Abeokuta North Local Government Area, Kunle Folarin, urged the new monarch to mobilise human and material resources for the rapid growth of the community.
