The Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT) on Thursday adjourned indefinitely the trial of the Senate President, Bukola Saraki, for false assets declaration. The Tribunal Chairman, Danladi Umar, said the decision was taken because of pending appeals on the matter at the Supreme Court. The appeals were filed by Saraki and the Federal Government. “The tribunal has decided to adjourn sine die (indefinitely) pending the outcome of the appeals at the Supreme Court,” Umar said. The defence team led by Chief Kanu Agabi (SAN) had earlier informed the tribunal that the Supreme Court had fixed March 15 for hearing of the pending appeals. Saraki is standing trial on three-count charge of false assets declaration after the Court of Appeal had struck out 15 of the charges in December last year.
