The Federal High Court in Lagos will on March 27 hear a suit filed by a former commissioner in Lagos, Adewale Ahmed, seeking the nullification of the one-year extension of the All Progressives Congress (APC) officers’ tenure by the party’s National Executive Committee. The tenure of the party’s National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun and other officials at the national, state, local government and ward levels were extended at APC NEC meeting on February 27. The officers’ four-year tenure is expected to expire on June 30. Ahmed is praying the court to declare the tenure extension unconstitutional. He is also praying the court to stop the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) from dealing with the Odigie-Oyegun-led National Working Committee once their tenure expires. Odigie-Oyegun, Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Segun Oni, Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Lawal Shaibu, National Secretary, Mr. Ibrahim Gubi, Vice-Chairman (South-West), Mr. Pius Akinyelure, APC and INEC are the defendants. The applicant, in the March 9 Originating Summons, is praying the court to determine if the defendants had the constitutional right under Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Articles 13 and 17 of the APC Constitution to extend the tenure of its NEC and NWC members. Justice Mojisola Olatoregun directed Ahmed to serve all the processes and hearing notices on the defendants. She adjourned the matter till March 27 for hearing.
