Dutch coach, Clemens Westerhof has said Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr’s 28-man squad for the two friendly matches against Poland and Serbia represents Nigeria’s best squad for the Russia 2018 World Cup. “Is Mikel in the team? What of (Wilfred) Ndidi, (Odion) Ighalo, (Ogenyi) Onazi, (Victor) Moses?,” Westerhof asked. When told they were in the team, he said Coach Rohr has unveiled his real World Cup team. “Good, that is the best team Nigeria has at the moment. That is the team he (Rohr) will take to the World Cup. But they must fight to get to the quarter-final, semifinal, yes. Nigeria has good players, but they must prepare very well. The coach must use good tactics at the World Cup,” he told Scorenigeria.com.ng. Westerhof qualified Nigeria for its first World Cup in 1994, when the Eagles reached the Round of 16.
