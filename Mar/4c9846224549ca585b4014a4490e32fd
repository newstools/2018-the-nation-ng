The Technical Director of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN), Sunday Adeleye has dismissed the fears that the disappearance of Emmanuel Bamidele from the Abuja camp would affect the performance of the team at next month’s Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. There are indications that Bamidele may have opted to represent Qatar after competing at the national trials where he ran the second best time in the world in men’s 400 metres. The record breaking athlete dwarfed his personal best twice at the Commonwealth Games in Abuja having run 45.85s in the semi-finals and then ran 45.28s to win the event ahead of colleagues – Orukpe Erayokan who finished second in 46.40s, and Isah Salihu who finished third in 46.56s. Bamidele’s time in the final (45.28s) is the second world leading time after Botswana’s Isaac Makwala time of 45.03secs. While insinuations are rife that Bamidele may have switched allegiance to the oil rich nation of Qatar, the AFN technical director, Sunday Adeleye told NationSport that the athlete absconded from camp. “I don’t want to believe he has change nationality to Qatar because he just absconded from camp after the trials and we believe he cannot represent Qatar for now as the transfer window has been closed by the International Associations of Athletics Federation (IAAF). “I must also state categorically that his absence would not affect the performance of the team in Australia. We have over three athletes we are preparing to better his time in the men’s 400 metres and we believe they can better his time before the Commonwealth Games,” Adeleye added. He, however, said that the team would continue its training in Abuja ahead of the Games as they are expected to depart the country to Australia on March 25 for the final conditioning and competition at the games.
