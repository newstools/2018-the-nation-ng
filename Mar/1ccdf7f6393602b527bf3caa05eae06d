Facetime is that song you can enjoy stuck in the traffic, stuck in the bathroom shower or on the road just taking in good vibes. LottoBoyzz’s FaceTime is a song that is going to give lead vocalists a run for their money. Even WizKid’s and Tiwa’s vocals should be warned. These two fellas got bars. While people would rather WhatsApp or use Facebook Messenger, Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat; Lottoboyzz would rather prefer a Face time. FaceTime is an app that shares the same features as IMO or WhatsApp visual features in connecting with your partner. It is purely FaceTime where you communicate through video and instead of clacking fingers via keypads; FaceTime is a persuasive call to a lover to just have a Face time than wallowing in the business of exchanging wack emojis. Which obviously betrays one’s true feelings. In a world where fake responses occur via chat; FaceTime is a way to test the true strength of love’s resolve. Hence the first line: “And I don’t really like typing, Babe just FaceTime me.” The features of FaceTime require you registering undiluted attention to the person in the visual conversation and as such, the song begs the lover to leave other guys on WhatsApp and spend quality time with him, asking her how she got the perfect body curves. It doesn’t just stop there; this smitten lover wants more than just company, he wants to spice up the game by eventually hanging out with his lover.

He obviously wants to use the FaceTime to check how curvy the lady on the other side is. If she is not thick enough or her curves are not real enough, they wouldn’t hang out or go on a date. Isn’t that why he wants to ask how she got her bum fat? What is spectacular about FaceTime is LottoBoyzz ingenuity in registering a theme we are familiar with. Other artistes sing songs praising female attributes openly but LottoBoyzz do this seamlessly with several metaphors hidden in the lyrics and feel good instrumentals to accompany the beat. FaceTime is sweet yet sublime with several puns and vague expressions oozing out with a very well delivered lyric. If you don’t like this song from the first word till the end; you definitely are a rock that doesn’t want to be moved. I will rate FaceTime a 9/10. It is a song for all seasons and it says the same thing differently. Nigerian Music has continued to have song clichés; you can easily predict how a song like this would do in the hands of popular A list artistes with loads of several vulgar characteristics to describe the body of a woman. FaceTime says this in mild terms with a video that is just fine. LottoBoyzz would go far in the Nigerian Music scene with songs well laid out like this.
