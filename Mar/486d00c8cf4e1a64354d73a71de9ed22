The Coordinator of NAYES, Mr Abdullahi Labaran Maina, made this known in Keffi, Keffi Local Government Area of the state on Thursday that the scheme was part of the government’s efforts to create job opportunities for youths. According to him, Gov. Tanko Almakura of Nasarawa State is committed to reducing youths’ restiveness, poverty, as well as improve standard of living. The NAYES coordinator urged youths to be proactive in the discharge of their duties, stressing that their work was mainly to protect the environment and check indiscriminate cutting of trees.
