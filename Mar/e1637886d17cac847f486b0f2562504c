Journalists in Lagos have been urged to avail themselves of the on-going health screening at the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) secretariat,  Alausa, Ikeja, Lagos. According to NUJ Lagos Council Chairman Dr Qasim Akinreti, the council and a non- governmental organisation (NGO), Breast Alert Nigeria, have organised a one-month health programme for journalists, their relatives and the public. “Health is wealth. Welfare of journalists is important to this administration and that is why we are extending the health screening by two more weeks. From 9am to 5pm daily, Monday to  Saturday, the team of Breast Alert Nigeria is around to attend to participants, including during the Easter holidays. Records have shown that many journalists are taking advantage of the programme. We are here to serve, so due to popular demand we are extending the programme by two more weeks. It ends next Saturday. ‘’Our members can also come in on Saturdays because we realised some cannot participate during week days due to the dynamics of our call of duties.” The chair of the health committee, Mrs Julie Ekong of the Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), said the  screening would cover the following: Clinical breast examination, cervical cancer screening using visual inspection acetic acid solution method. Eye check and collection of glasses, screening for hypertension and diabetes. Breast Alert Nigeria founder, Dr Chidima Opoko said each participant would pay N1,000. The first 100 persons to access the services would go home with free breast examination devices to help them do self-breast screening. Any patient with a suspected case of breast or cervical cancer would be referred to the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH) for follow up, he added.
