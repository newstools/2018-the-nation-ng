The Delta State Chief Judge, Justice Marshal Umukoro has advocated for an independent department within the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) that will prosecute suspects following conclusion of investigations. Justice Umukoro made the call in Asaba-the Delta State Capital when the anti-graft agency, Benin Zone paid him a courtesy call. Umukoro described corruption as a cancer which has infected the socio-economic and political fabric of the Nigerian society. He said one of the ways to tame the “monster” is to tailor the operations of the EFCC towards the prosecutorial architecture of England Police and adopted  by the State’s Ministry of Justice where the police  arrest , investigate  and handover to the Crown Prosecution Service for prosecution. He said this procedure will reduce the human element vulnerable to corruption, bias and power abuse. Justice Umukoro decried media trial of suspects where the EFCC uploads whole proof of evidence unto the social media, thereby jeopardizing unbiased assessment of facts and figures. He said no matter the damaging evidence has been uploaded and tested before a court that it becomes evidence. Head Operations, EFCC Benin Zone, Mailafa Yakubu said the agency was in Asaba to appreciate the judiciary in the fight against corruption by speedily disposing of cases brought before it.
