Southampton on Tuesday sacked manager Mauricio Pellegrino. This came as the team is just one point and one place above the Premier League relegation zone with eight games left this season. The Saints have won just one of their past 17 league matches and lost 3-0 at Newcastle United on Saturday. Pellegrino, a former Argentina defender, was appointed in June as the successor to Claude Puel. Saints face Wigan on Sunday for a place in the FA Cup semi-finals. They are in their sixth successive season in the Premier League and have not finished lower than 14th in any of the previous five. Following Saturday’s match, Pellegrino said he “observed some players who gave up”. However, Alan Pardew is the odds-on favourite to be the next Premier League manager sacked after his poor West Brom record continued. Pardew has enjoyed just a single victory in the 18 matches that he has been in charge at The Hawthorns.
