One of the richest African women, Folorunso Alakija, paid a courtesy visit to the Head Office of The Nation Newspaper in Lagos, on occasion of the International Women’s Day Celebrations last week. Folorunso Alakija, a Nigerian business woman, is a business tycoon involved in Fashion, Oil and advocating better life for the women. Emphasizing the secrets of success, she said we all need success in every area of our life in order to press for progress. Sacrifices must be made to accomplish progress and mark difference. “For success to be attained there must be an agenda in your head. Be focused, utilize your time properly, embody credibility, be reliable and responsibility will make you succeed,” Alakija stated. The Business tycoon clamoured for equal opportunity amongst men and women, encouraging females to think beyond the barrier of just rearing children alone. “Females should be encouraged that there is more to life than rearing children and they can be whoever they want to be. The girl child should be given equal opportunity just as the boy child. Gender equality should be a foundation laid by parents just has charity begins at home.” “You are responsible for your life, utilize your opportunities and say no to those who say you can’t achieve it.”
