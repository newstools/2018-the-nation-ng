MEMBERS  of the United Community Development Associations (CDA) in Era and Adaloko in  Oto-Awori Local Council Development Area (LCDA) of Lagos State have asked the Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) to stop sending then crazy bills. They demanded for pre-paid meters to guide against ‘’these outrageous bills’’. They said they would take steps to bar the firm’s officials from coming into their communities if their conditions are not met. The CDA appealed to the Federal Government to allow it to buy pre-paid meters from the manufacturers so as to stop Disco staff from exploiting customers. The CDA spokesman, Mr. Dele Odebiyi, said the communities contributed to buying their cable poles,  aluminium conductors and transformers. “We also contribute to pay for services and parts anytime our transformers develop faults. All the Discos come to do is to install and switch on the transformers, for which they arm-twist us into ceding the ownership of the equipment to them as a pre-condition to linking us to the national  grid, for which we also pay them to do. So, why are we paying for services not rendered? Why must we continue to pay for darkness?” he asked.
