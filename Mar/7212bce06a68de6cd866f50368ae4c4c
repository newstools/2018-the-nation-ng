A group, African Farmers and Cultural Organisation (AFCO), has  mapped out strategies to reduce unemployment among youths through agriculture. AFCO, which has members across the country, aims at using agriculture to correct social vices due to unemployment, and to redirect the government’s policies towards agro-based economy. At its programme tagged: “Job creation/empowerment for the unemployed” in Lagos, its founder, Prince Chukwunwike Moses Esiole, said the  group was striving to create jobs through agriculture. He said the approach was to train youths to explore the various aspects of farming. “Any job seeker, who wants to go into farming and does not have the technical knowhow and logistics, AFCO will train you in the area you want to be specialised and empower you also. As a member of our organisation, if you do not have a job, no idea of what to do, no good educational background, and no skills, AFCO will develop your skills through our Institute of Fine Arts and  empower you financially.” Its Secretary-General, Francis Sokomba, said AFCO would organise a farmers’ friendship festival to promote  food  production  and  sustainable livelihood strategies. “Our traditions and heritage have always been powered by food rites, and our co-existence is relatively secured by agriculture. Through this event, we  are  welcoming ideas and seeking co-operation from Africans in the Diaspora,” he said. At the event were Chief Adione Gabriel Ifeanyichukwu, Mrs Tracy Esiole, Nollywood actor Victor Osuagwu and other top dignitaries.
