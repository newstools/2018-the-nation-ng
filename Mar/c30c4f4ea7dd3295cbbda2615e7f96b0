Isolo Local Council Development Area (LCDA) Chairman Alhaji Shamsudeen Abiodun Olaleye has distributed gifts and cash to 100 widows, physically-challenge and the aged people. Olaleye said the programme will run every quarter. He appealed to those who do not benefitted from the gesture to wait for the next edition. According to him, every deserving beneficiary cannot be captured at once due to paucity of funds. He said: “The point is everybody wants to benefit at the same time which is practically impossible. It is not about my officials. It is about patience of the people. We have addressed that from onset. We envisaged situation like this, that’s why we are appealing to them that those that do not benefit today (yesterday) stand a chance in the next quarter,” he said. Olaleye said the programme was parts of his campaign promises to cater for the less privileged in the council. “It’s very easy to maintain because it has been budgeted for. The extension has been stated in the financial book of the council and it is a campaign promise too. It is not just this programme, we have the Bursary programme that runs every quarter,” he said. According to him, beneficiaries have to be resident in the council regardless of which political divide such person belongs, adding: “we don’t draw a political line among those categories of people. You don’t need to be member my party, All Progressives Congress (APC) to be a beneficiary. All you just need is to be a resident of the local government and we determine that with your Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASRRA) card.”
