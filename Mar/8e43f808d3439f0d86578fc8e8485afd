Former Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Science and Technology in the 3rd Republic and now a traditional ruler in Lagos State, HRM Oba (Dr.) Oladele Friday Kosoko (JP), Ogundeyi 11, Oniworo of Iworo Kingdom, at the weekend opposed the plan by the federal government to build new toll gates in 36 strategic locations in the country. He called on the National Assembly to stop the planned reintroduction of toll gates by considering a bill on the alternative to toll plaza. He told The Nation that the recent call by the Hon. Minister of Works, Power and Housing, Mr. Babatunde Raji Fashola (SAN), for the federal government to reintroduce toll gates on Nigerian highways is a waste of public funds. He made the statement in Lagos while reacting to recent reports which indicated that the federal government has concluded plan to meet stakeholders on the proposed new toll gates but the royal father said toll gates were initially constructed with billions of naira and later dismantled with billions of naira, which is wasteful. Dismissing FG’s new plan to reintroduce toll gates as an ‘unfavourable policy’, Oba Kosoko said if the aim of the government is to generate funds for maintenance of roads, there is a better alternative to toll plaza from which the government can generate N400billion annually. According to him, “this should be sufficient to maintain our roads.” Oba Kosoko also said “it is worrisome that Hon. Minister of Works, Power and Housing could mislead the federal government on the way to generate fund for the maintenance of federal roads,” warning that “if the toll plaza is allowed to function, it would create avenues for hoodlums and bottleneck for road users.”
