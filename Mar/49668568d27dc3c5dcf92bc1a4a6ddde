Malaga FC of Spain striker, Brown Ideye has not ruled out the possibility of playing for the Super Eagles in the future, saying he is ready to prove his worth and fight for the opportunity to represent Nigeria at the World Cup if given the chance, reports AOIFootball.com. Ideye, who was instrumental to the Super Eagles’ 2013 AFCON triumph, after forming a solid partnership with Emmanuel Emenike, said he was still willing to play for the Eagles despite the fact that he has been overlooked for the Poland and Serbia friendlies. He said he would continue to give his best at club level to improve his chances of getting a another invitation to the Eagles. “It’s not too difficult to understand why I was out of the national team fold for a while because of my situation in China last year. But I am here now in Malaga and I believe I can fight and lay a claim for a recall to the Super Eagles’ fold. “Maybe the upcoming friendlies are too soon, but I am keeping my options open,” Ideye added. The former West Brom striker, however, stated that his eyes were set on making the Eagles’ preliminary squad for the World Cup, insisting that it will provide him an opportunity to prove all doubters wrong. “I am working so hard on and off the pitch to make the 30-man preliminary list for the World Cup. Then I will prove myself to the coaches and all Nigerians that I deserve a place in the national team. It won’t be easy but I am fully prepared for the task ahead,” Ideye concluded. Ideye last featured for Nigeria in 2016 and will be looking to add to his current 28 caps as the World Cup draws closer.
