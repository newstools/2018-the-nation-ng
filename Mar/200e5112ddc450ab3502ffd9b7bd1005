Minister of Health, Prof. Isaac Adewole has praised oil giant Shell Petroleum Development Company for donating a radiotherapy machine for cancer treatment to the National Hospital, Abuja. He spoke while inspecting the Elekta machine for Linear Accelerator (LINAC), made up of several components, would be put to use in June. Adewole said the Abuja Radiotherapy Centre would be running on two linear accelerators. He said: “The beauty of having two machines is that if one packs up, the second one will be in use for the benefit of cancer patients.’’ Adewole the machine will contribute immensely to the fight against cancer. He called on other multi-national organisations, individuals and groups to emulate Shell. He reiterated Federal Government’s commitment to the reduction of cancer, which is being demonstrated by the phased installation of one cancer treatment machine in each of the six geo-political zones and two in Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The National Hospital, Abuja, Chief Medical Director, Dr. Jeff Momoh, noted that the second machine would assist in providing  standard cancer treatment to patients in Nigeria and other African countries, thereby reducing cancer burden in the continent. The representative of Shell Petroleum Development Company, Dr. Akinwumi Fajola, said the donation the machine was one of the company’s way of giving back to the society.
