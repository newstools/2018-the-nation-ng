A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Ebenezer Babatope, said on Saturday the exit of Prof. Tunde Adeniran and Prof. Jerry Gana from the party would not diminish its strength. Babatope, a former Minister of Transport, stated this in a chat with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN). Adeniran and Gana dumped the PDP for the Social Democratic Party (SDP) recently. Babatope said although the two politicians contributed greatly to the PDP, the party should respect their decision to move on. He said there was no need calling for their return to the PDP as they were competent adults. “Prof. Adeniran and Prof. Gana were strong members of the PDP. Unfortunately, they have left and there is nothing anybody can do about that. “I am not one of those calling for their return to the PDP because they have the democratic right to join any party that suits them. “Again, they are competent and intelligent adults who must have reasoned very well before they took the decision. “Even though the feeling might not be too good, being that I have known them for long, especially Adeniran, I cannot fault or stop their decisions. “I believe the PDP will remain strong even with their exit, as the party was built on strong foundations and not personalities,’’ he said.
