Dr Celine Njoku, a Marriage Counsellor at Holy Family Catholic Church, Festac Town, Lagos, on Thursday advised couples to be patient and tolerate one another to avoid divorce. Njoku, a Counselling Psychologist, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that most couples did not know what marriage was all about before venturing into it. “We are getting everything wrong. I think these are the problems we are having divorce. “Divorce should not be in the agenda. To start with, majority of us are Christians. We are lacking tolerance. ‘’We are lacking peace; we are being judgmental; we are not overcoming anger.  “Then, we should be able to tolerate; we should be able to overcome anger. In the beginning, God saw all these things and say for better or worse. “Some people are 60 years in marriage. Are they superhuman? They are not. They passed through all these troubles. ‘’Marriage is sweet. At the same time bitter and at the end you come out glorified,’’ she said.
