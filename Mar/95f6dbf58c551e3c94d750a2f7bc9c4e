Six governors in the north met in Sokoto State on Wednesday to sign a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Dangote Foundation and USAID to extend the routine polio immunization programme. Nasiru El-Rufa’i (Kaduna), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Kashim Shettima (Borno), Muhammed Abubakar (Bauchi), Aminu Tambuwal (Sokoto) and representative of Governor Ibrahim Gaidam of Yobe State were present at the signing. Also present was Minister of Health Prof. Isaac Adewole. Tambuwal described Bill Gates as a demonstration of a true philanthropist, who not only touched lives, but went beyond his race and country for humanity. He described Aliko Dangote as an unequal interventionist in economic development, health and other humanitarian activities in Nigeria and Africa. Tambuwal also hailed the Federal Government for supporting the programme and promised that Sokoto State would ensure quality and standard healthcare service delivery to the people. El-Rufa’i noted that the north had been on the news for the wrong reasons, especially for health-related matters. He stressed that the region is committed to changing the narratives. He described the signing of the MoU extension as a significant milestone that would ensure the integration of all critical elements, with a shift to more functional health system services against killer diseases.
