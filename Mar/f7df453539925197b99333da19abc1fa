NOLLYWOOD actors, Grace Ama and Doris Simeon, were among celebrities who came out to support their colleague, Queen Blessing Ebigieson as she celebrated military widows at the Ikeja Military Cantonment recently through her foundation, Queen Blessing Foundation. At the event, social activist and Women Arise founder, Dr Joe Okei-Odumakin, commended the philanthropic efforts of the founder of Queen Blessing Foundation, ambassador Blessing Ebigieson. The activist who received a humanitarian award along with the founder of God Bless Nigeria, Pastor Tony Rapu, said that the community was in dire need of ordinary people with the golden hearts like Queen Blessing Ebigieson as a lot of needs could be met through caring hearts. Scores of widows from the Nigeria Army Officers Wives Association, NAOWA and their Navy and Air Force counterparts were feted at the 10th anniversary of the foundation and the 5th edition of its Valentine special. A day skill acquisition on bag-making, bead-making and shoe-making using local fabrics was carried out before the valentine empowerment event with the gifted hands of Ambassador Chibuzor Patrick, aka Oluchi. Out of the few women that participated, the first sewing machine was won by the woman who made a bag from her experience in the training. Patron of the foundation, Jimi Agbaje, presented wrappers and other gift items to the widows. Other colleagues of the movie producer, who hails from Okpella Edo State, who turned out to support their own were Ejiro Okurame, Gloria Mba and broadcaster Monalisa. The convener noted that eighty percent of the materials came from her purse as she is passionate about plight of widows and wishes to do more but for lack of funds and support. In his closing remark, the Brigadier General A. E Attu congratulated Queen Blessing for the wonderful jobs done for their widows.
