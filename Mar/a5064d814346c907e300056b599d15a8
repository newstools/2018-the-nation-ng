Former Governor of Edo State, Adams Oshiomhole, has urged enlightened members of the public and the media to always link Nigeria’s recent history to the present when discussing on current hardship in the country. Oshiomhole said it was laughable for people to blame the problems of unemployment, economic hardship and herdsmen on the All Progressive Congress (APC) when several editorials written by Nigeria’s newspapers in the past had always harped on such issues. The ex-governor said the current economic hardship in the country was the result of the PDP’s looting of funds meant for public welfare. Speaking to journalists at his Iyamho country home at the weekend, Oshiomhole said President Buhari cannot rebuild the country overnight. He said the daily confession of PDP members on how public funds were looted should tell us that “the armed robbers of yesterday cannot be our option.” He said: “All the newspapers editorials written from the days of the PDP were about all these issues you raised. They did not develop yesterday. What was meant for public welfare was stolen by the PDP. “These are being revealed everyday. I read them from the pages of the newspaper how much that were stolen by all kinds of ministers, directors and so on. If a house has been emptied like that, don’t you know there will be consequences. “Rebuilding Nigeria cannot be an overnight affair. Look at the numbers being thrown up everyday. There are confessions everyday. The enlightened members of the public which the media represent must be able to link the present with the recent past and understand this house cannot be rebuilt overnight. What no one can dispute is the fact that something is being done but the results cannot be a miracle. There are no miracles in a nation’s life, it has to be steady.”
