Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has assured  scavengers and other workers at the Olusosun dump that he would help them find ways of earning a living without risking their lives. In a statement at the weekend,   Ambode’s Chief Press Secretary Habib Aruna said the governor spoke when he visited the dump follwing Wednesday’s fire. The dump is still emitting smoke, which is affecting motorists’ visibility. The governor noted  that there was need to engage the scavengers and workers following the dump’s closure. According to him, the location of the facility is no longer healthy for traders and residents. The facility’s structure, he added,  was also risky and susceptible to  hazards such as fire. Ambode said : “We thank God nothing bad happened to those living there and around the neighbourhood. What we have decided now is that there will not be dumping of refuse here any longer. “But the most important aspect of it is that I cannot open my eyes and allow diseases to befall you here. “You may not have diseases now, but there is no way you can say you are looking for money without contending with series of hazards and a clear example is the fire outbreak. “At the end of the day, it is government that will still care for you. So, we have to sit down and agree’’. The governor said it was not government’s intention to make people lose their means of livelihood, adding that all the stakeholders must agree on what to be done going forward. “We are not here to cause pain for you, we will engage all of you on how we can improve on the environment and also make life bearable for you and your children,” Ambode said.
