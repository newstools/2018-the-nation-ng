From the way things are panning out in Nairobi, Kenya at the 2018 ITTF Africa Top 16 Cup, Olufunke Oshonaike believes nobody can lay claim to the title at the start of the competition. Oshonaike, who defeated Seychelles’ Bristol Christy 3-0 in the first round of the women’s event told NationSport that the altitude in Nairobi is working against most of the players. “I must say that nobody is sure of winning the tournament because the altitude has not been helping at all and every player has been complaining about this. But there is nothing we can do as we just have to give our best and do well. My target is the title but I know it is not going to be an easy task for me in Nairobi,” she said. “My first game was a bit difficult because I am yet to get used to the atmosphere in Nairobi but with time, I am going to be used to it. I know the Egyptians are roaring to go but we will allow them to run over this time around as we are ready to give them a fight till the end of the competition,” she added. The 2016 African Champion however, lauded the organisers of the tournament – Kenya Table Tennis Association (KTTA) for putting up a good show despite the low-level of the sport in the Eastern African nation. “I am so much impressed with what I am seeing in Nairobi because the organization has been superb and I know with more tournament being staged in Kenya, they will also be among the top playing nations in the continent,” Oshonaike said.
