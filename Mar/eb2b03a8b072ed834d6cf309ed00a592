Ondo Professionals in Edo State have said that achievements recorded by Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State in the past one year have shown that the administration of Olusegun Mimiko was directionless. A statement issued to journalists in Benin City and signed by its chairman, Dr. Samson Falana, said the people of Ondo are now breathing the air of freedom, and prosperity as against when they languished in hopelessness under Mimiko. Dr. Falana noted that the state economy is bouncing back under Akeredolu following the construction of the largest egg powder factory in Africa. Falana urged the people to support Akeredolu as projects commissioned to mark one year in office could be compared to the regime of Governor Adekunle Ajasin. The statement reads in parts, “We implore politicians in the state to support Akeredolu to deliver dividends of democracy.”
