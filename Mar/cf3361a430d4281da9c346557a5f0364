The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Ondo State Command, has arrested three students for alleged examination malpractices during the ongoing Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). The Commandant, Mr. Pedro Awili, told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday in Akure that the suspects were nabbed at Adeyemi College of Education, Ondo and Oyemekun Grammar School, Akure. He said only NSCDC was given the mandate to deploy officers and men across the country to monitor and supervise UTME Computer Based Test (CBT). ”Despite the command’s effort to educate students and warn them to shun examination malpractices, some who cannot write exams without cheating were arrested. “During this UTME, the command has arrested three suspects – one female and two males. They are in our detection. “Those caught will be prosecuted. This will act as a deterrent to others,” Awili said.
