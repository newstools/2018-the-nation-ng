In commemoration of World Forest Day 2018, officials of the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI) organised a comprehensive tour of the first engineered sanitary landfill located in Epe. The landfill is being developed by Visionscape Sanitation Services. The tour, attended by environmentalists, waste management companies, Non-governmental Organisations and government officials, included bodies like KidsBeachGarden, 123Recycle, RecyclePoints, E-Terra,  was to give an insight into the workings of the landfill and the process of waste management within a controlled environment. The Landfill Operations Manager, Mr. Sumeet Singh said over 350 scavengers had been registered and inducted into Visionscape’s processes. According to Singh, an average of 30 trucks from various Waste Collection Operators (WCO) already use the landfill daily to dispose waste, which is then levelled to prevent waste piling. Sumeet reiterated the company’s commitment to working with all waste collection operators, assuring that “Visionscape is committed to building local capacity in the waste management industry; we will work and support all players to improve standards and overall efficiency of all waste management operations.” He said the firm kick-started operations at the landfill in January 2018. The landfill at Epe is the first in Nigeria; it is expected to serve as an Ecopark, where waste-to-energy plans, wastewater treatment, material recycling, and other vital environmental friendly procedures are carried out daily.
