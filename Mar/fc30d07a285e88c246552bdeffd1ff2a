I am currently a fake wrist watch carrier. This is my personal confession on the path to restitution. I know you are all smiles now probably wondering what I mean by being a “fake watch carrier.” A fake watch carrier is one who wears a watch that doesn’t work. Now this watch that never works can never ever work. You heard me clear. It can never work! And for some of us, the watch used to work before but since it is too fashionable, like mine, it is too hard to throw away. While for some others the watch has stopped working ages ago. But slay queens must pepper them and men must show their swag. So, what do we do? We wear fake watches that never tells the time. Don’t blame us. You know I said this was a confession. I am changing slowly, so I publicly restitute with this testament. If you are a fake watch carrier just say “Oh, yeah!” One day I was quietly embarrassed by the fake watch. Many times, I cradle my phone, so when someone asks for time from my watch, I just use my phone and tell the time. On this very day, I was running late and I got into this three vehicular machine we all use. Three minutes down the line and someone was gesticulating to my fake watch. Apparently, he went thus: “Sir, he nodded with respect, ” What is the time?” I quickly spun out my phone and told him. He wasn’t too convinced and looked at me wondering why I had to stress myself. Reaching for my phone was now stress, in his mind. He stared at me for awhile and the beautiful lady who might have laughed at me in her mind. I was sad, I knew I was ousted. But how can I stop wearing this favourite watch of mine? It has this silver lining that is responsible for its beautiful glitters. I love it and I am too lazy to repair it. Too much workload and stuff to worry about. But sadly, I wear this watch all about Lagos. Are you a fake watch carrier? Tell us in the comment box! I will be waiting.
