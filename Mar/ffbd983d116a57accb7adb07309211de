The United Nations said on Saturday suspension of humanitarian operations in Rann, Borno State, was still in force. The UN withdrew its workers from the community after a March 1 attack by suspected Boko Haram terrorists killed eight persons including three aid workers. A nurse was also abducted by insurgents during the attack. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN-OCHA) said Nigeria’s Humanitarian Coordinator, Mr. Edward Kallon, was meeting with high-level government officials in Abuja. It also said that Kallon would travel to Maiduguri next week for assessment of the situation in the North East. “At present, there is no aid worker presence in Rann as the 52 aid workers who were there were evacuated last Friday. “Across North East Nigeria, there are approximately 3,000 aid workers operating in 26 locations, compared to only a few hundred in early 2016,” the UN said. It explained that the operational capacity of humanitarian partners in the three states most affected by Boko Haram insurgency – Adamawa, Borno and Yobe – continued to expand. The UN said the humanitarian partners in the three states consisted of 73 national and international partners. NAN
