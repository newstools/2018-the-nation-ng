Rivers State High Court in Port Harcourt yesterday ordered substituted service on the state chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) and seven other chieftains in the N1 billion defamation suit brought against them by King Ateke Tom. Tom, the Amanyanabo of Okochiri clan in Okirika Local Government, last month filed a N1 billion suit against eight chieftains of APC for alleged defamation. The matter was mentioned for the first time yesterday.   The respondents were absent. They have not been served. The plaintiff told the court that they evaded service. The APC chieftains sued are Asita O. Asita, deputy governorship candidate of the party in the 2015 election, Dr. Davies Ikanya, the state chairman, Dumo Lulu Briggs and Sampson Ngerigbara. Others include Prince Tonye Princewill, Sekonte Davies, Emeka Beke, APC secretary and Lawrence Chuku. Counsel to the plaintiff, Granville Abibo, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), said efforts to serve the defendants failed. He alleged that they evaded service and prayed the court to grant the bailiffs an order to use substituted means to effect the service. The request was granted. Justice Constance Green ordered the applicant and the bailiff to serve the defendants by substituted means. He adjourned the matter till May 9 for pre-trial conference.
