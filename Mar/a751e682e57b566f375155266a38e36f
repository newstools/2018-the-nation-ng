Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) undergraduate, Enoch Adegoke will be making his senior debut for Nigeria at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and the sprint specialist is not ready to just be a participant at the Gold Coast games in Australia. Adegoke, 100m men champion at the final of the Athletics Federation of Nigeria (AFN) Commonwealth Trials in Abuja, told NationSport yesterday that it was a dream comes true for him making the 37-man Team Nigeria list to the multi-sport championship. “It has always been my dream to compete for Nigeria at big stage like the Commonwealth Games and I cannot describe my feeling for making the final cut. I am just too excited that I will be competing at my first international tournament at senior level. It is not a smooth route to make the list; it was years, months and days of training under the watchful eyes of Coach Ayokunle Odelusi who has been an inspiration to me. I am not going to Australia to admire other athletes but to prove a point and also make my presence counts,” Adegoke said. The year two geography undergraduate however, admitted that representing Nigeria at such a big tournament would spur me on to aim high in the competition. “I want to thank God for ensuring that my dream becomes a reality. It has been a tough road to this stage and I am hoping that I can improve my personal best to 10.1secs at the games. I believe it is possible because other competitors are human being like me and everybody will only give his best,” he added. He expressed confidence in the team, adding that the training at the Abuja camp would aid the athletes to put the country on the podium at the games. “The camp is going on well and I am confidence that we can make Nigeria proud at the games because we have been training very well under the watchful eyes of the technical crew. We also need to believe in ourselves if we hope to make impact in Australia,” Adegoke enthused.
