The Cattleman Feedlot Service Group has said it has all it takes to tackle the  lingering farmers and herdsmen clashes bedeviling the country. The group said it will do it through its proposed agri-prenuers training for both parties on modern way of farming and rearing cattle, which in return will facilitate the growth in the agricultural sector and boost the nation’s economy. In a press statement by its spokesperson, Mr Richard Ogundele, the group said, the unmet demand for healthy meat consumption and the clash between farmers and herdsmen necessitated the training. According to the statement, the training in collaboration with JMSF Agribusiness Nigeria will be supported by the Nigerian Institute of Animal Science (NIAS), whose registered member will be in attendance. It argued that, Nigeria as a nation is yet to tap from the economic benefit attached to modern livestock rearing and that the training when completed will provide the participants with ability to produce special cattle feeds for rapid turn around and production circles. According to the group, “Nigeria’s population is expected to reach 350 million by year 2030. Over 7. 5 million cattle and 35 million  goats and sheep worth  an estimate value of N180 billion is consumed annually, and  in Lagos state, over  six thousand cattle slaughtered daily accounts for about 23 per cent of national consumption. ” It said, the training scheduled to commence from 26th to 30th of March of in Lagos, will apart from shifting the focus of herders away from grazing to modern way of cattle ranching, also avail them with the opportunity to learn production of finished feeds while market will be created for both cattle rearers and feed makers. “Training Materials, certificate, access to market, weighing belt will be given to all participants, with 2-month pro-bono consultancy.” he added.
