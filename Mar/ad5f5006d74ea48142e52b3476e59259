The three month old strike by non-teaching staff of Nigerian Universities may soon come to an end as there appear to be light at the end of the tunnel following conciliatory meeting between the striking and the federal government team. The three unions namely Non-Academic Staff Union of Educational and Associated Institutions (NASU), National Association of Academic Technologists (NAAT) and the Senior Staff Association of Nigerian Universities (SSANU) operating under the acronym of the Joint Action Committee have been on strike since December 4, 2017 and have summoned a meeting of the National Executive Committee for Wednesday to access the strike. The Minister Labour and Employment, Senator Chris Ngige who presided over the conciliatory appeal to them consider the plight of the students and return to work while the government address their demands. The meeting which had the leadership of the unions and the officials of the Federal Ministry of Education in attendance deliberated exhaustively on all the outstanding issues raised by the unions. Ngige recounted steps already taken by the current administration to permanently resolve all outstanding matters that disrupt academic activities in the universities as well as the measures being taken at present to settle the trade dispute with the Joint Action Committee and appealed to them to call off the strike. Chairman of the Joint Action Committee and National President of the Senior Staff Association of Nigeria Universities (SSANU), Comrade Samson Ugokwe said the strike  continue until there is something concrete from the government side. Ugokwe told The Nation on phone after the meeting that a meeting of the leadership of the three unions has been called for Wednesday at the NAAT secretariat to take a position on the strike. He said the Minister of Labour has assured them that they will be formed of what the government is approving to meet the workers demand after the Federal Executive Council meeting on Wednesday, adding that the figure from the government will be presented to the NEC for consideration, saying if members decided to suspend the strike, it will be suspended.
