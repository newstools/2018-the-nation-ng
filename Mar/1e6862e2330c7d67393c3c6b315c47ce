A former sole administrator of the Delta State University (DELSU), Abraka, Prof Abednego Ekoko, has decried the upsurge in reported cases of sexual harassment by male lecturers in universities. He attributed the scourge to low morality and discipline plaguing the nation. He urged the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC) to enact stringent laws and policies to check sexual harassment and plagiarism in tertiary institutions. Ekoko, who spoke in Asaba, Delta State, said the issue of “sex for grades” in many universities between male lecturers and female students had not only lowered academic standards, but also debased the value and honour of the girl-child. He advocated dismissal and jail term for any male lecturer harassing female students, adding that this would restore the dignity of womanhood and required academic excellence. Ekoko described the standards of universities as “abysmal and deteriorating”, urging universities to live up to expectation. He said plagiarism was rife in universities, adding that staff discipline should be revisited, as “academics who plagiarise are imparting academic leprosy to students”.
