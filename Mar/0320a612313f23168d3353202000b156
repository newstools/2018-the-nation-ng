The Lagos State government has stressed the need for material testing as a way to achieve the vision of zero-building collapse in the state. Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Prince Rotimi Ogunleye said the vision must be concertedly and meticulously pursued by government and the building professionals with strict adherence to guiding rules, regulations and professional conduct. Ogunleye spoke during an inspection tour to the State Materials Testing Laboratory (LSMTL) at Ojodu. He said additional responsibility of regulating and certifying the practices of privately-owned testing laboratories added to the mandates of the LSMTL should spur the agency to live above board. He said: “This agency is one of the core agencies of the ministry and its role is vital. The incidences of building collapse send a negative signal to government and this explains why the government has been doing everything within its ability to reduce the incidences to barest minimum if not totally eradicate it. “Having inspected the various facilities here, I am convinced that if we do the right thing, this agency would perform its role diligently and effectively. We cannot afford to be lackadaisical; we must reach our peak to drive the built sector forward and ensure zero tolerance to building collapse.” LSMTL Acting General Manager Olalekan Ajani promised that the officials of the agency will continue to discharge their duties diligently and with integrity, noting that the recruitment of additional professionals – engineers, geologists and builders – are good impetus for the manpower capacity of the agency. “We are working on capacity building, this we do through retraining of our staff by organising trainings and conferences regularly so that we can key into the vision of the state government. We reiterate the need for our staff to demonstrate diligence, honesty, loyalty and integrity in the discharge of their duties”.
