The Senate may have concluded arrangements to upturn the rejection of the amendment to the Electoral Act by President Muhammadu Buhari, it was learnt yesterday. President Buhari’s letter declining assent was read on Tuesday The Presidential letter sparked anxiety at the two chambers of the National Assembly leading to a series of clandestine meetings by the pro- and anti-Electoral Act amendment lawmakers. A source privy to the meeting, said “pro-Buhari governors, senators, House of Representatives members and ministers” attended one of the meetings “to formulate measures to frustrate the plan to override the assent of the president on the Bill.” In the same vain, lawmakers determined to override the president on the Bill were also shopping for members to make up the 74 needed by the Senate to override the president. “Some friendly governors,” sympathetic to the National Assembly on the reordering of election sequence in the country, were said to have continued to hold meetings with interested lawmakers. It was learnt that “if the leadership of the National Assembly is convinced of the required number,” the lawmakers might over ride the president next week. The Senate leadership is said to be of “high hope” that the required number of senators who would back the move to over ride the president would be met. The source also said that “serious flaws have been identified in the constitutional provisions relied upon by the president to withhold assent to the Bill.”
