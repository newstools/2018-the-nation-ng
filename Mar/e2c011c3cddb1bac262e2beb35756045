SUPER Eagles Group D match against Argentina on June 26 in Saint Petersburg has been sold out, but not so for Nigeria’s two other group games against Croatia and Iceland. The most expensive ticket for these group games goes for over 70,000 Naira. All three group games of Egypt have also been sold out – Egypt versus Uruguay, Russia versus Egypt and Saudi Arabia versus Egypt. Several other matches involving other African teams at Russia 2018 have also been sold out – Japan versus Senegal, Belgium versus Tunisia and Portugal versus Morocco. Experts have therefore questioned the passion of Nigeria fans for the game with some blaming the recent recession in the country for the slowness of ticket sales concerning Eagles group games.
