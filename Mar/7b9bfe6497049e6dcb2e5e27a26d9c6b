WITH a mission to entertain, educate, and empower kids with knowledge, Mango TV, from the stable of Mango Television and Production Company Limited, is set to hit TV screens soon. According to its management, Mango TV is a special purpose vehicle founded by highly experienced business, media management, production and marketing experts. Speaking on the plans for the new station, one of its directors, Francis Ogboro revealed that the administrative arm of the company will launch out of Nigeria from a management and content creation standpoint, which will be known as Mango Media, while the channel will be known as Mango TV. According to him, Mango TV will be a safe place for families to watch television as it will see the emergence of a carefully created African Children’s TV Channel that will not only entertain African Children, but also educate the African Child using examples, characters and stories that they can relate to. “It is vital that the African Child is exposed to ‘Afro-Centric’ programs which entertain and educate, the result of which will manifest in a more informed, educated, aware, open-minded, confident and empowered adult. “Mango TV content will be made primarily in Nigeria, thus employing young presenters and actors, while creating much needed work for professionals within the various disciplines of the Nigerian Creative Industries,” he said. True to his words, some of the TV’s content currently on its YouTube channel include a children’s anthem rendered by a couple of Nigerian kids, as well as animated stories like ‘How The Zebra Got Its Stripes’, ‘Ani Owo’, narrated by actress, Dakore Egbuson Akande as well as ‘The Old Warrior’, narrated by comedian and actor, Bovi Ugbomah.
