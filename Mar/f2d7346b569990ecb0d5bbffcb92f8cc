Abuja youths in partnership with the police, Lugbe Division, have planned a peaceful rally to check youth unrest in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The rally, according to its organisers, is to foster peaceful co-existence among the youths and engender mutual relationship between commercial motorcycle operators and the Abuja Joint Task Force (JTF). Speaking on behalf of the youths during a briefing in Abuja, Sadiq Badamasi described the rally as important considering persistent clashes with security operatives in the territory. He said rather than the police and JTF arresting corrupt politicians, there is a crackdown on youths, who hawk and do little businesses to make a living. Badamasi, who is the National President of Youth Initiative for Diversity in Nigeria, said the rally will hold on March 31, with support from the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Nigeria Security Civil and Civil Defence Corps  (NSCDC) as well as officials of the Man O War. According to him, the rally will discourage youths in the territory from being used as political thugs. “The level of youth involvement in political participation leaves a lot to be desired. Youths have failed to commit to social restructuring and many simply just don’t care. Meanwhile, others who are in a hurry to hit it big have devised unscrupulous means to enrich themselves,” he added. Representative of the police, Assistant Suprintendent of Police, Efuyobu Ngbede lauded the initiative but urged the group to officially write to the police division. In her remarks, FRSC Chief Route Commander, Chioma Ekeocha pledged to support the peaceful rally by providing officers to reduce traffic and offer needed support in case of emergency.
