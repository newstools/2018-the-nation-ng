Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has approved the appointment of 2,459 local government workers. The employees include  1,500 regular administrative and professional workers, 114 physically-challenged and 845 street sweepers. The employment was the first in the last 10 years by the Local Government Service Commission (LGSC). Introducing the workers to the ethics of the civil service at an interactive session  at the Local Government Training School on Monday, LGSC’s Chairman Mr Babatunde Rotinwa urged them to treat the public courteously. The session was held by LGSC in conjunction with Lagos State Pension Commission (LASPEC), with some accredited Pension Fund Administrators (PFAs) in attendance. Rotinwa said: “Be well behaved, dress well and be a good ambassador of this commission and the local government where you may be posted to serve. You must all remember that you are now part of a service that is being sustained by the tax payers’ money. Remember that Local Government business is a serious business and your actions and inactions can hurt, kill or move the local government forward.”
