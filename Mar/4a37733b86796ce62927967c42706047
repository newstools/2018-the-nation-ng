The Handball Federation of Nigeria (HFN) has confirmed it has secured a mouth-watering sponsorship deal that will revive the National Handball League, which has not been held for about seven years. The Secretary General of the federation, Haruna Maigidansanma, who disclosed this at the weekend, assured that the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), would soon be signed in the coming weeks with the unveiling of the sponsor. “It is a good development for handball and the move will help reposition the sport, which was one of the top before it fell on hard time. Right now, the HFN board led by the President Sam Ocheho is working tirelessly to bring back handball to its glorious days. “The unveiling of the sponsor will be done latest in two weeks and our hope at the HFN is that it will revitalize handball in the country. With a good league, our players will be busy for most part of the year and our national teams will become competitive once again,” Maigidansanma added. Maigidansanma disclosed that 12 teams in the male category and 10 teams in the female category would take part in a tournament slated for Abuja from April 27 to May 6, for the first phase, while the second phase will hold in October. The HFN scribe explained that the deal would see the winner go home with the sum of N1, 000, 000, the second placed team will get N750, 000, while the third place team will smile home with N500, 000 in both the male and female categories. He said each team would also get a subsidy of N250, 000 in each phase with branded Jerseys. Maigidansanma said the deal is a groundbreaking one in the history handball and expressed delight at the Samuel Ocheho-led HFN board.
