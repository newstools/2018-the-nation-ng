The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted partly cloudy to cloudy weather conditions over the central states of the country on Saturday. NiMet’s Weather Outlook by its Central Forecast Office in Abuja on Friday also predicted day and night temperatures in the range of 33 to 41 and 19 to 29 degrees Celsius respectively. The agency predicted that the southern states would experience cloudy morning over the inland and coastal cities with day and night temperatures in the range of 30 to 36 and 22 to 26 degrees Celsius. It also predicted localised thunderstorm over Owerri, Akure, Ibadan, Oshogbo, Ikom, Asaba, Ogoja, Calabar, Warri, Eket, Yenegoa and Portharcourt in the afternoon and evening hours. According to NiMet, Northern states will experience partly cloudy to sunny conditions throughout the forecast period with day and night temperatures in the ranges of 38 to 42 and 20 to 27 degrees Celsius. “Localised thunderstorm over some parts of the southern region of the country are not unlikely and stability over some parts of the northern states in the next 24 hours,” NiMet predicted.
