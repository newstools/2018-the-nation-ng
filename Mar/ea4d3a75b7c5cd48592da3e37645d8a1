Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has signalled that House of Representatives Majority Leader Femi Gbajabiamila will seek re-election in 2019. The governor gave the indication at the inauguration of a road the lawmaker facilitated at Modele and Mathew area of Surulere Federal Constituency. Gbajabiamila also installed solar-powered lights on Randle Avenue and Fred Anyiam Street last Friday. Indications that Gbajabiamila would get a re-election happened at the weekend when the lawmaker was expressing appreciation to his constituents for the unprecedented support he got from them over the years. His speech at the event drove home his desire to return to the National Assembly next year. The moment Gbajabiamila used his first finger to indicate support he received in his first term, second finger for his second term through his fourth finger for the fourth term, the opening of his five fingers triggered the response of the governor. Ambode affirmed with his five fingers’ thumb-up to the delight of Surulere residents, who were celebrating the inaugu8ration of the new road the lawmaker facilitated in the area. Moments later, All Progressives Congress (APC) members and other residents displayed their five fingers to affirm the non-verbal consent of Ambode to Gbajabiamila’s aspiration in 2019. Gbajabiamila was the choice of the ruling APC in the race for the Speaker of the House of Representatives in 2015 with the incumbent Speaker, Yakubu Dogara, running in defiance to the directive of the APC and in collusion with the opposition, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which led to the narrow defeat of the Majority Leader with six votes. “Your Excellency, I have no reason to fail our people in Surulere. They have been supportive and rewarded my representation with overwhelming votes in my first, second, third, fourth terms. “
