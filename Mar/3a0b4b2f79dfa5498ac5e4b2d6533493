The Chief Judge of Lagos State, Justice Opeyemi Oke, on Wednesday launched new sentencing guidelines for use by courts in the state. The guidelines were signed by the chief judge as practice direction for magistrates and high court judges as part of justice sector reform. They were intended to ensure uniformity in sentence and fines imposed for certain offences by magistrates in particular and forestall prison congestion. Addressing the inaugural meeting of Justice Sector Reform Committee on Wednesday, Justice Oke pointed out that the vision of the Lagos State Judiciary under the present administration is to make speedy dispensation of justice a hallmark of the judiciary and improve on its reputation as a pace setter. The chief judge noted that this can only be achieved through inter agency collaboration and cooperation of stakeholders. She disclosed that a committee has also been set up to proffer practice direction for the use of the Administration of Criminal Law of Lagos State for the purpose of making the law more explicit for judges, magistrates and prosecutors.
