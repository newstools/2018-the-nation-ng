Kenyan opposition figure, Miguna Miguna, said he was beaten and drugged before being forcibly removed from the country for a second time. The deportation came hours after a court held top officials in contempt for failing to release him from the airport where he was being held, the BBC reports. Kenyan officials have argued the lawyer – who holds dual Canadian nationality – is not a citizen. But Mr. Miguna, who was flown to Dubai, said their motives are political. He has now appealed for help through his social media accounts. “I was dragged, assaulted, drugged and forcefully flown to Dubai,” Mr. Miguna wrote in a Facebook post on Thursday. “I woke up in Dubai and the despots are here insisting that I must travel to London.” He added he was being threatened, and wanted to fly to Nairobi and “nowhere else.” “I’m sick. My ribs and body is hurting all over. This is a travesty of justice,” he wrote. Kenyan High Court judge, George Odunga, has now fined the country’s interior minister, the head of police and head of immigration $2,000 (£1,400) each for contempt of court. Judge Odunga said the three senior government officials had “failed to adhere to the rule of law” and ignored the orders of the court in their treatment of Mr. Miguna.
