Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser, Gernot Rohr has been urged to retain Deportivo La Coruna shot-stopper Francis Uzoho against the Serbian senior national team when the team takes them on Tuesday night, AOIFootball.com reports. Uzoho, who was in goal against Poland, had a below average first half but improved in the second half and former Nigerian goalkeeper, Abiodun Baruwa believes the young goalkeeper can be better with more games and has advised Coach Rohr to give him another chance to help build his confidence in goal. Baruwa stated this while speaking on Brila FM, monitored by AOIFootball.com. “Uzoho did well overall against Poland, though he had a poor first half, he improved in the second half. My opinion is that the coach should give him another chance to help build his confidence. I think he will come good with time,” he said.
