AXA Mansard Health Limited, a leading health insurance provider and its partners African Women’s Entrepreneurship Programme (AWEP) and Alliance Hospital, Abuja have showed their commitment to tackling breast cancer by sponsoring a breast cancer seminar. It was titled: ‘Current trends in the management of breast cancer.’ The event featured the education on breast cancer and its management. An oncologist Dr Bisi Ademuyiwa listed strategies on preventing cancer, handling triple negative breast cancers, global best practices and emerging new trends in breast cancer treatment. She dispelled myths and  tales about the nature, causes, spread and treatment of breast cancer. Dr. Ademuyiwa also consulted with 40 breast cancer patients at the Alliance Hospital, Garki, Abuja. This was in line with AXA Mansard’s focus on the needs of the  women, and its SHE (Super Heroes Everyday) Initiative, through which the firm demonstrates its understanding of the woman – her nature,  needs, goals and achievements. The SHE initiative identifies how important the woman is and proffers solutions to her challenges. AXA Mansard Health Limited Chief Executive Officer Mr. Tope Adeniyi said: ” Breast cancer is beyond just a health issue; it has social and economic implications on its victims, their families and their societies. We will, therefore, continue to be an active participant in the fight against the deadly scourge.” Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women. It kills about half a million of them yearly due to insufficient medical care and awareness about the disease.
