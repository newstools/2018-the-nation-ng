Lagos State House of Assembly yesterday gave  Commissioner for Local Government and Community Affairs Muslim Folami, and Onibeju of Ibeju-Lekki Rafiu Salami a week to reverse the installation of Mufutau Olamiji as Baale of Okegun, Ladeseso in Ibeju Lekki. The lawmakers will determine their next line of action after the expiration of the one-week deadline. The resolution followed the adoption of the report of the House Committee on Judiciary, Human Rights, Public Petitions and LASIEC on a petition titled: “Complaints against the representation of one Mufutau Olamiji as the Bale of Okegun of Ibeju-Lekki Local Government Area of Lagos State.” The petition was brought by Ismaila Ogunkoya of Okegun Odofin. In the committee’s report, its Chairman, Mrs Adefunmilayo Tejuoso  noted that only Okegun Odofin, Okegun School were genuine, adding that the one  created by the Onibeju known as Okegun Ladeseso to which Olamiji lays claim  was unknown in the original layout of Ibeju-Lekki. It said Oba Salami fraudulently installed Olamiji, who was his personal assistant as Bale of Aladeseso to override Ogunkoya. The panel said the commissioner connived with the Onibeju to install Olajimi, adding that Folami also proceeded to the tribunal when the  committee was doing its job despite being asked to stay action. Speaker Mudashiru Obasa warned Folami and Salami to respect the resolution so as not to incur the lawmakers’ anger.  He directed that the Attorney-General  be officially informed of the resolution. “We will give them (Commissioner and Onibeju) the opportunity to rescind. We will use this as a test case and I am sure they will comply. They should ensure sanity in Okegun. “There is need to review the law on chieftaincy titles, the remuneration and to regulate the way and manner Obas and Baales emerge in every nook and cranny in Lagos State,” he said.
