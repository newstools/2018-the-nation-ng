WHILE people have been wondering about the sudden disappearance of Rudeboy Records signees, Muna and Lucy, the label owner and singer, Paul Okoye has come out to reveal reasons the artistes left his outfit. Paul told The Nation that education caused Lucy’s decision to leave while Muno left willingly early this year. “I am going to be honest with you, let me be the first person that owns a record label that will make such decision. I have two artistes Lucy and Muno. Lucy was in school for a long time and then her parents said they wanted her to finish school and it was taking my time for almost a year and they said they want her to be on her own and I said ok no problem. Like I always say, my own thing is stronger than any other thing. That’s one thing I understand so they best thing I did was accept and we prepared document to let her move. Also, early this year my male artiste came and said he wants to leave and I said no problem. “These are signs for me to know that some people don’t have patience. Look at what is going on between artistes and labels now. I don’t think I have time. Trust me, I no get energy. It’s going to be hard for me to sign an artiste now but I can assist or help,” he said. Continuing, he said that people have to understand that there’s what they call luck and there’s what they call patience at the same time. “If you are lucky one or two songs is enough to blow you but if you are patient you continues until you actually discover yourself. Or you expect me to call people to put you in shows? No! Your music should draw people to call you themselves. For me, signing an artiste is not in my agenda,” he added.
