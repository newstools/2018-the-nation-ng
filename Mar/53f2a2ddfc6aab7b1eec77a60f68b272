 Bastian Schweinsteiger and Ana Ivanovic have announced the birth of their first child after posting a series of heartwarming pictures of their baby boy on social media. The former Manchester United midfielder took to his Instagram page to share a picture of his little boy’s feet with the caption, ‘Welcome to the world our little boy! We are so happy.’ His wife and ex-tennis star Ivanovic also announced the news of their new-born baby on Monday morning and showed off his huge teddy bear collection. Ivanovic said with delight on her Instagram page: ‘Welcome to the world our little boy. Words cannot describe the joy and the happiness we feel in our hearts!’ The couple revealed the news that they were expecting back in November after Ivanovic posted a picture of a tiny pair of Adidas Yeezy trainers alongside her own and her husband’s. Schweinsteiger, 33, now plays for Chicago Fire and has one assist in the one game he has played this season. The World Cup winner spent two seasons at Old Trafford before making his switch to the MLS. Ex-United boss Louis van Gaal recently hit out at Jose Mourinho’s treatment of Schweinsteiger during his time at the club. The Dutchman said in February: ‘Schweinsteiger was older, of course, but not too old. Still, his body was not able to keep up with the high demands of Premier League. Bayern sold him to us as fit player, but, in reality, physically he had reached the end. ‘How Mourinho treated him after me, Schweini did not deserve this. But it also explains how things were with Schweinsteiger. ‘It’s a shame because he is a player like Luis Enrique, Mark van Bommel or Philipp Lahm, a character always present on the pitch.’
