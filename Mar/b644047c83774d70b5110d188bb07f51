With preparations for the 2018 Gidi Fest in full swing, organisers have added more names to the line-up of artistes who will be thrilling guests come March 30. Scheduled for Hard Rock Café Beach Front, Landmark , Oniru, Lagos, the latest additions to artistes performing are DJ Spinall, Ric Hasani, Ghanaian Songstress Efya, Tay Iwar, Odunsi, while the duo of Spanky and Jess will host the show. One of the founders of the concert series, Chin Okeke, explained that “it had to be special for our 5th edition and we wanted to make sure there was something for everybody.” This year the organisers have introduced the Next Gen Stage, which they will curate and promote in partnership with Universal Music. The stage serves as an ode to a very progressive movement of young determined creatives who aren’t taking no for an answer and challenging the status quo. So it’s only makes sense that they have their platform. GidiFest2018 is put together by Eclipse Live, sponsored by More Live and Seatgate and is refreshed by Pepsi and Power Horse as the exclusive energy drink partner. It is also supported by Hard Rock Café, Jameson, Virgin Atlantic, Mikano, Ntel, Universal Music and Lagos State.
