Recuperating Super Eagles goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme will return to the national team to take the traditional kick off before Nigeria’s final World Cup friendly against England in May. Gernot Rohr confirmed this while speaking in a BBC World Service programme monitored by Owngoalnigeria.com. It means he will once again be back in the Eagles fold for the first time since he was diagnosed with Leukaemia just before the start of pre-season training at English Championship side, Wolverhampton Wanderers. The goalkeepers crisis rocking the Eagles became an issue of concern to many Nigerians after first choice goalkeeper, Carl Ikeme was diagnosed with Leukaemia. Ikeme’s unfortunate diagnosis left the Super Eagles coach, Gernot Rohr with few options in the goalkeeping department, and after using Daniel Akpeyi for a while, Ikechukwu Ezenwa is now the first choice shot stopper of the team. Ezenwa upstaged the Chippa United safe hands after injury ruled him out of Nigeria’s back-to-back 208 World Cup qualifiers against Cameroon in Uyo and Yaounde respectively. Despite the performances of the duo Nigerians are still skeptical of their abilities, with many clamouring for Deportivo La Coruna B goalkeeper, Francis Odinaka Uzoho to man the post at the World Cup.
