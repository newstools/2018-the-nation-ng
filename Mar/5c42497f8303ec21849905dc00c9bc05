• Friendly foes, Poland up to sixth Nigeria remain in 52nd place in the latest FIFA Rankings released yesterday, but fellow World Cup finalists Poland, who the Super Eagles will battle later this month in a friendly, have shot to sixth place in the ratings. Most countries have not been in action in the past month which has led to very little movement in the global rankings by FIFA. Consequently, Nigeria stays seventh in Africa, behind Tunisia, Senegal, Congo DR, Morocco, Egypt, and Cameroun. However, Nigeria’s 2018 World Cup Group D opponents Argentina, Croatia, and Iceland are among the top 20 as they sit 4th, 15th and 18th in the updated rankings. The Super Eagles next two opponents Poland and Serbia are ranked 6th and 34th respectively. There were no changes in the top five. Germany tops the rankings, with Brazil, Portugal, and Belgium completing the best five teams in the world. The next FIFA Coca-Cola rankings will be released on April 12, 2018. Poland are now just a spot shy of their best-ever position in the rankings. The Eagles will face Serbia four days after they take on Poland on March 23. The Serbians remain in 34th spot.
