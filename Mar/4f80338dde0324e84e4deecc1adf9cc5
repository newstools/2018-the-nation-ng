THE Lagos State Consumer Protection Agency (LASCOPA) yesterday vowed to check all forms of abuse of consumers’ rights. It warned that “it will no longer be business as usual.” Its officials marched from the Lagos State Secretariat, Alausa,  to Allen Avenue, Ikeja, as part activities to mark this year’s World Consumer Day. Addressing reporters after the walk, LASCOPA Chairman Mrs Funmilola Falana said the agency would do everything  to protect consumers, adding that its services were free. LASCOPA General Manager Oluwakemi Olugbode said the era of cheating and short-changing consumers was over. She urged the public to visit the agency’s office, call or send emails to report any individual or company that deprived them of their rights. She said plans were underway to take the sensitisation walk to Epe, Badagry, Ikorodu and other areas of the state. She said it was time to give consumers value for their money. March 15 is observed yearly as World Consumer Protection Day.
