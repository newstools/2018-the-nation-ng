Anambra State is partnering Readers Association of Nigeria (RAN), a literacy enhancement project, to improve reading culture, Education Commissioner Prof. Kate Omenugha has said. She told News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Awka that the partnership had led to a workshop to enhance educational development and boost reading culture. Omenugha said the workshop would help teachers to assess their pupils. She said with Anambra being a pacesetter in education, pupils should be able to read and do a self-assessment for improved performance. The commissioner said Governor Willie Obianoâ€™s efforts in the sector had positioned the state on the path of academic excellence. She said a resource person, Prof. Rob Tierney, from the University of Sydney, Australia, was invited to speak to teachers on the need to embrace portfolio assessment. Omenugha said it would help teachers to assess pupils, who will assess themselves for enhanced development. She said teachers should play a vital role in making reading interesting to children, adding that this will enable them develop interest in academic activities. The commissioner urged teachers not to be harsh on pupils when they make mistakes, but correct them with love. She hailed the National President of RAN, Mrs. Irene Mbanefo, and her team for their good work to revive reading culture. Omenugha said the workshop would inculcate reading skills in teachers.
