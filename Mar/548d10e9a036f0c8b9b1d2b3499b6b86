A FOUR-and-a-half- year-old pupil of Chrisland School, Lekki Lagos yesterday told an Ikeja Sexual Offences Special Court how her supervisor, Adenekan Adegboyega, defiled her two years ago. She was led in evidence by the prosecutor, Mr B.T. Boye, before Justice Sybil Nwaka. Asked why she was in the court room, she said: “I am here to explain all the bad things that Mr Adenekan did to me”. When asked how many times she was defiled, she said “two times.” She said: “The first time, he did it in his office. The second time was in the corner outside. He put his hand inside my wee wee. It really pained me. When I screamed, he covered my mouth with his hand. When I tried to scream again, he tightened his hand on my mouth”. At this stage, the prosecutor asked her to identify Adenekan in court but she refused to look at him in the dock. But when confronted with the pictures of the defendant, she identified her aggressor and retorted: “I remember now. He put his wee wee in my mouth”. Asked to show where Adenekan’s wee wee was, she touched the mid region of her body to indicate the location of a male’s manhood and to the lower region of her body to indicate her private parts. She denied visiting Adenekan in her office except on the day “when he did bad thing to me”. Asked by Adegboyega’s counsel Olatunde Adejuyigbe (SAN), if she loves drawing, she said: “I love drawing but I don’t want to draw in this place. It is very scary.” The judge then intervened and calmed her. When confronted by the defence counsel that she was tutored on what to say, the girl replied: “nobody told me what to say when I come here today”. Earlier under cross examination by Adejuyigbe, the girl’s mother said her daughter told her that Adenekan abused her in his office and at a nearby corner. The case continues on May 21.
