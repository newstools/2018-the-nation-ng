A chieftain of the All progressives Congress ( APC ), Mr. Adewale Hameed, on Wednesday urged a Federal High Court in Lagos to declare the purported tenure elongation of APC’s national officers as unconstitutional. Listed as the defendants are – the National Chairman of APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Segun Oni and Deputy National Chairman (North), Senator Lawal Shaibu. Others are – the National Secretary, Mr Ibrahim Gubi and Vice-Chairman (South-West), Mr. Pius Akinyelure, as the fourth and fifth defendants. The APC and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) were the sixth and seventh defendants in the matter. The National Executive Committee (NEC) and the National Working Committee (NWC) of the party had at a joint meeting in Abuja extended the tenure of the officials by one year with effect from June 30. Following the decision, the applicant had on March 9 filed an originating summons, asking the court to determine whether the tenure elongation was constitutional. He wants the court to determine if the defendants had the constitutional right under Section 223 of the 1999 Constitution and Articles 13 and 17 of the APC Constitution to extend the tenure of the party officials.
