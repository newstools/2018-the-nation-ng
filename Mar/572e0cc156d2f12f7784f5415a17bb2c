The duo will be supported by an array of some of the most sought after Nigerian acts making waves across the globe. Among them are Maleek Berry, Ycee, Adekunle Gold, Brymo, Show Dem Camp and Mayorkun. Speaking at the media unveil of the 2018 edition of Gidi Fest concert held at Hard Rock Café recently, one of the organisers, Chin Okeke said that this year’s concert will feature a second stage that will raise up the next generation of very talented artists that are moving the underground and redefining the Nigerian sound. This new wave, Okeke said, will be represented by D-Truce, Makka, Remmy Baggins, Lady Donli, D-O, Chyn, Jinmi Abduls, as well as Jamal Swiss. “The festival has in previous years featured African and international acts and this year will be no different so stay tuned for the second announcement that will fortify the Gidi Culture Festival as the foremost and most progressive music festival on the continent that has set out to empower the youth and bridge the gap on and off the continent,” he said. Also speaking at the event, 2Baba said; “It’s a pleasure and honour for me to be on this festival. Gidi Fest has been there and somehow I’ve always missed out so to speak. This year I’m happy to be a part of this. It’s only going to be bigger and better.” Gidi Fest 2018 is sponsored by Pepsi, Hard Rock Café, Power Horse with support from Eko Hotel, Virgin Atlantic, Mikano, as well as Universal Music.
