United States Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, has departed for Africa on a weeklong five-country official visit to Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti. The visit will end March 13. Tillerson, during the visit, will meet President Muhammadu Buhari and other top government officials, and the leaders of the three other countries. The trip, his first official visit to Africa, as Secretary of State, will begin with a trip to Ethiopia and later to Djibouti from where he will go to Kenya and Chad before coming to Nigeria. Speaking at George Mason University, Virginia, before his departure, the Secretary of State expressed optimism that there was ample opportunity in Africa for economic growth, greater prosperity and for responding to global challenges through mutually respectful partnerships. According to him, he looks forward to returning and building on a strong foundation of U.S.-Africa relations, including visiting Chad, a country that has never before welcomed a visit by the Secretary of State. Speaking on “U.S.-Africa Relations: A New Framework,” Tillerson said over the past century, as African nations emerged from their colonial past, there had been a dramatic increase in America’s engagement with Africa. “40 years ago this month, President Jimmy Carter visited Liberia and Nigeria, where he announced that ‘our nation has now turned in an unprecedented way toward Africa’. “Today that turning continues. Our country’s security and economic prosperity are linked with Africa’s like never before,” he said, adding the Africa-U.S. engagement will only intensify in the coming decades for several reasons.
