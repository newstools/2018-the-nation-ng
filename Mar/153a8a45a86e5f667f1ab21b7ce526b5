President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated former Technical Adviser of the Super Eagles, Adegboye Onigbinde, on his 80th birthday, slated for March 5. Buhari’s congratulatory message is contained in a statement issued by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Sunday. The president felicitated with the highly respected football coach and administrator, his family, friends and teeming fans, on the landmark of turning an octogenarian. He noted that at 80, football administrator had recorded a retinue of awards, recognition and achievements at national, continental and global levels. The president said Onigbinde’s feat as a coach would always be cherished and remembered as milestone attainments for the nation. Buhari said his wealth of experience and the leadership skills he acquired over the years would be most useful in inspiring the national team, upcoming footballers and Nigeria’s local league to greater heights. He, therefore, prayed that the Almighty God would grant him longer years on earth and more strength and wisdom to keep serving the country. Onigbinde, born on March 5, 1938 in Modakeke, Osun, led the national team to the FIFA World Cup in 2002. He also took the country’s football teams to continental tournaments like the African Nations Cup and the African Clubs Champions Cup.
