As the Adeleke University, Ede in Osun State  matriculates 1,200 fresh students for the 2018/2019 academic year, the institution Vice Chancellor, Prof. Samuel Ekundayo Alao, has urged the Federal Government to declare a state of emergency in the education sector. The declaration, he said, will enable the government to restructure, reinvigorate and reposition the education blueprint of “this great nation”. Alao, who spoke at the university’s Seventh matriculation, said the Federal Government should intervene to check the decline in education standard in the interest of Nigerian youths. He said: “We have all lost focus and sense of direction in our educational goals. I appeal with all sense of respect and decorum to the National Assembly and education stakeholders, to declare a state of emergency on the education system of the country. Such declaration will enable us to restructure, reinvigorate and reposition the education blueprint of this great nation. “Out of several millions of applicants that applied for undergraduate admissions in Nigeria, just about 15 to 20 per cent will be given admission this 2018/2019 academic year.” He also called on the government to vote more fund to the education sector and adopt holistic approach in identifying multifaceted problems, which according to him, were thwarting the delivery of uninterrupted and qualitative education in Nigeria. Alao also lamented that universities were lagging behind in the global community.
