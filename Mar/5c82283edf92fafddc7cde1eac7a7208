Coach Purity Akuh has admitted that India and Canada remain Nigeria’s greatest threats at the XXI Commonwealth Games holding in Gold Coast, Australia. Akuh, however, assured that with the training the Nigerian wrestlers are undergoing in Yenogoa, Bayelsa, the team has the wherewithal to do well at the Games. He stated that this year’s Commonwealth Games would be exciting and competitive considering the quality of wrestlers favoured to win gold medals. “We believe and hope that we can do better than our last outing because we have quality wrestlers who are also world class in their various cadres. “For now, we have been training very hard in Bayelsa and the athletes are all in high spirit. But I must also acknowledge that wrestlers from India and Canada are not pushovers in the girls’ freestyle event because they are also teams to be reckoned with. We won’t be complacent but continue to work hard while hoping that God will reward our efforts,” Akuh added. Akuh, who was adjudged the best coach at the 2017 Nigeria Sport Award, acknowledged the technical input of the President of Nigeria Wrestling Federation (NWF), Daniel Igali, saying, “Igali has been helping out in camp. As an Olympian, Igali has been encouraging the team by watching training sessions and adding his own inputs,” he stated. He added: “All the athletes have been given the mandate to make sure they watch videos of their possible opponents and we can all come together to analyse the videos to see areas where they can build on that will give them an edge over their opponents at the Games.”
