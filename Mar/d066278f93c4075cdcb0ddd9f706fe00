The Lagos State Polytechnic will on Thursday graduate 6,355 students. The Rector, Mr. Samuel Sogunro, stated this at a news conference to announce the institutionâ€™s 26th convocation ceremony. Of this number, 211 earned a distinction; 1,368 got upper credit; 3,505 got lower credit while 1,271 obtained a pass degree. According to him, the weeklong cermonies would begin with an interdenominational service, convocation dinner/variety show, convocation lecture, novelty football match, and a convocation play, among others. Sogunro recalled that the polytechnic, which opened its doors in 1978 with 257 students across five programmes, now owns a radio station, consistent power supply, a re-accreditation to operate as JAMB CBT centre; a large scale farming and TETFund-sponsored institution-based research, among others.
