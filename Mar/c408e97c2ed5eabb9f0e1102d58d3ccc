 . Ready to rival Botswana’s Montsho With her 51.40seconds in the women’s 400metre, Patience Okon George is the second best athlete in the world behind Botswana’s Amantle Montsho and the Nigerian champion is hoping to erase the time and set a new record at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast, Australia. George, who sealed her place in the 37-man Nigerian contingent to the games next month with 51.94 seconds in the final of the women’s 400m at the Nigeria Golden League held at the University of Port Harcourt, believes she can rival the Botswana when the athletics event kicks off. “Being the second best athlete in the world in terms of timing in the women’s 400metre, I am hoping that I can erase this time and set a new record in Australia. There is no doubt that the Botswana lady will be a threat in Australia but I am really ready not to be a participant but also climb the podium,” she said. Having watched the Jamaican and Britons at the just concluded World Indoor in England, George said she has picked some tricks and skills that will enhance her performance in Australia. “I am in good shape and at the right frame of mind for the Commonwealth Games and watching the World Indoor Championship has indeed given me an idea of what to expect in Australia. The training we have been having in Abuja has really put us in shape for the games,” she added. The 26-year-old is indeed eyeing an individual medal in Australia. “I know I had won a medal at the games but that was in the team event but this time around I am hopeful that I can win an individual medal in the 400m and I am indeed working toward achieving this next month,” she enthused. The two-time African Championships bronze medalist however, expressed optimism in Team Nigeria, saying that with quality training the team can still hold sway in Australia. George was part of the Nigerian quartet that came second behind Jamaica at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow
