In the search for solutions to the deplorable health conditions in Nigeria’s urban slums, over 24 researchers and 15 urban slum dwellers are set to use satellite image (open street maps) to digitise and analyse access to health facilities in some urban slums in Lagos and Oyo states. Nigeria’s lead investigator of the NIHR Global Health Research Unit on Improving Health in Slums, Prof Akinyinka Omigbodun, broke the news yesterday in Ibadan, the Oyo State capital, at the training of graduate students and slum dwellers on mapping health services in urban slums in Lagos (Bariga) and Oyo (Sasha and Idi-Ikan) states. The training was anchored by Dr Olakekan Taiwo. According to him, the multi-country study is aimed at improving health service delivery in selected communities in low and middle income countries. The research is intended to, among other objectives, assess the health care services available to urban slum dwellers and the accessibility of such services. The health challenges facing them become important in the face of growing urban slums and associated health service delivery constraints in Nigeria. Taiwo said researchers were conducting similar studies in Kenya, Pakistan and Bangladesh as part of the global NIHR project. Omigbodun noted that rapid urbanisation was displacing many people in Nigeria into urban slums. The expert noted that ailments and diseases, which were previously associated with rural settings, had begun to manifest with greater frequency in urban centres as an emerging global health concern.
