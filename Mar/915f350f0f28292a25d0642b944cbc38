 Angel di Maria is clearly proud of his roots and he paid homage to them permanently on Thursday. The Argentina flyer has had a leg tattoo depicting his childhood. The artwork which is situated on his right calf features his childhood home in Rosario’s district of Perdriel, a football and the Argentina flag. Di Maria was clearly delighted with his new ink by accompanying his Instagram story with the caption: ‘My history on my skin!!!’ once it was completed. The 30-year-old incorporated the smiley face emoji as well as he thanked his compatriot and tattooist @arturholykoi on his social media platform. Di Maria will be hoping to celebrate his new tattoo with a goal and victory when Paris Saint-Germain visit Nice in Ligue 1 on Sunday. Paris Saint-Germain’s defeat away to Nice late last season ended their hopes of winning the league. However, this time, PSG heads south to Nice with a huge lead at the top of the table and within touching distance of a fifth title in six seasons. Unai Emery’s side are 17 points clear of defending champion Monaco, albeit having played a game more, and it seems only a matter of time before the league is wrapped up. But Nice are hard to beat at home, even more so when PSG are visiting. The French giants were hassled, harried and out-fought during last season’s 3-1 defeat in late April. Lucien Favre’s side are in seventh place this season, but pushing Rennes and Nantes hard to finish in fifth and seal a potential spot in next season’s Europa League.
