Fashola stated this during the tour of electrification project in Sabo Gari Market in Kano. The project is being executed by a private firm, Sabo Gari Energy. He said the commitment to promote ease of doing businesses was because small and medium scale businesses were the major drivers of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) The minister said the Sabo Gari Energy project was critical because power was being generated and delivered to traders in the market without a grid system. He said the project had increased traders’ access to power, adding that instead of waiting for transmission grid, energy was generated and consumed in the market. “We have seen the control room where the energy comes and the solar panel where solar energy is converted to alternating current electricity. “About 3,000 out of the 12,000 shops have signed contract to be connected and about 500 have been connected and the last section of the market is being wired. “As the wiring continues, it is also creating employment in the procurement, manufacture, sale and installation units. “About 120 technicians have been employed. What this mean is that opportunities are coming and this is what our government is all about,” Fashola said. NAN
