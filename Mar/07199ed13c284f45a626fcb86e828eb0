A renewed Executive/Legislature squabble seems to be on the way. The House of Representatives plans to resend the contentious Electoral Act Amendment Bill to President Muhammadu Buhari for assent. However, this time, the contentious areas which are causing the President discomfort will be expunged, the Chairman, House Committee on Media and Public Affairs, Abdulrasak Namdas, said. Namdas told reporters yesterday that the House would   ”re-gazette the electoral act, expunge the contentious areas and debate on it as the procedure requires the House, and transmit it to the President for assent.” The president has declined assent on the Electoral Act Amendment bill on the premise that  the National Assembly lacks the power to rejig the time-table the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has set out for the   2019 general election. But the House spokesman said the Constitution gives the lawmakersthe power to do what they did. According to Namdas  the House will also override President Muhammadu Buhari on 10 bills sent to him by the National Assembly for  which he has refused assent . The bills, he said include the Nigerian Peace Corps establishment bill, Chartered Institute of Treasury Management establishment bill, Nigerian Council of Social Workers Establishment bill, Currency Conversion, Prison Orders Act Amendment bill and Police  Procurement Funds Establishment bill. Others are: Environmental Health Officers Act amendment bill,  Chartered Institute of Loans and Risk Management establishment bill, Chartered Institute of Public Management establishment bill, Chartered Institute of Export and Commodities  Brokers of Nigeria establishment bill and Federal University of Wukari establishment bill.
