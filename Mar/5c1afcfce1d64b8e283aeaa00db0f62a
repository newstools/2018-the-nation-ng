Sokoto State Police Command has arrested five suspects for alleged abatement and forgery of the National Identity Card. Spokesperson Cordelia Nwewe, who presented the suspects to reporters in Sokoto at the weekend, said two of the suspects were workers of a commercial bank, adding that the other three were business centre operators. She said based on information and intelligence report, operatives of the State Investigative Bureau (SIB) arrested five suspects in connection with the crime. “One Nasir Sifawa went to open an account with a commercial bank in Sokoto, where he met the accounting officer, Mudassiru Taofeeq, who enquired from him about the National Identity Card. “In the process, the officer informed his colleague, Perez Percy, who in turn demanded N4,000 and Sifawa’s details together with his passport photograph. “Eventually, a temporary slip of the National Identity Card was produced for Sifawa by the bank officer and was used to open the account,” Nwewe said. She added that Sifawa innocently and ignorantly took the forged slip to the National Identity Management Commission (NIMC) office in Bodinga Local Government. “This was with the aim of collecting the original National Identity Card, but when an NIMC official collected the slip, he discovered that it was a forged document. “As such, he alerted the NIMC head office in Sokoto, who in turn informed the command about the incident. “The suspects are cooperating with the police in their investigation,” the spokesperson said. The command has also arrested five robbery suspects. Nwewe said information about the suspects was reported at Gudu Police Division in Gudu Local Government. “The suspects blocked travellers from Niger Republic coming to Sokoto on the road near Boto village in Gudu Local Government.
