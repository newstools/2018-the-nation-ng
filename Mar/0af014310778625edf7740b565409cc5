Another ground breaking television show, ‘Borokini’, from the stable of Rare Edge Media is in the works. According to information, the production features Nollywood veterans including the likes of Taiwo Ibikunle, Tunde Oladimeji, Jaiye Kuti, Bimbo Oshin, Akin Lewis, Antar Laniyan, Alex Osifo, Ebun Oloyede (Olaiya Igwe) and Yemi Solade who recently turned 58 while on set of Borokini The Telenovela. Producers of the sitcom reveal that ‘Borokini’ captures the story of three elite friends and business partners, Laolu, Deji and Supo who go through different journeys and travails in their families, careers and aspirations. The story takes us through the trio’s connecting travesties in strengths and weakness. ‘Borokini’ is the story of Laolu (Akin Lewis), an extremely ambitious industrialist who wants to be king of his hometown Pakuro at all costs, Deji (Antar Laniyan), a calm looking University Professor who sleeps with Laolu’s wife Yetunde (Bimbo Oshin) to help make babies for him. Supo (Yemi Solade), on the other hand is a wifeless, carefree Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court who loves the fast life and wants to be Governor of his state. Their lives seem to have a semblance of calm till an old friend and brother simply referred to as Major (Alex Osifo), having retired from the military at that rank, miraculously returns, to the shock of the three friends who having presumed him dead in a car crash proceeds to appropriate his share of their oil business to themselves neglecting Major’s family completely. Major’s return set about a lot of disturbance in the trio’s life.
