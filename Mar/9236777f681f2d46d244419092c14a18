The Nigerian National Committee of the International Press Institute (IPI) has expressed “deep concerns” over the detention of Tony Ezimakor, the Abuja Bureaucracy Chief of the Independent,  by the Directorate of State Service. Ezimakor has spent seven days in the DSS detention. A statement by Raheem Adedoyin, the Secretary IPI Nigerian National Committee, called for the reporter’s immediate release or he be charged to court if he had violated any law. “The government must adhere to the due process at all times.  We join the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) and other Professional bodies to call on the government to clarify the status of the detained journalist.”. Some civil society organisations are organising a march tomorrow at the headquarters of the DS in Maitama, Abuja. In a joint statement, the groups said:  “We re-emphasise our demand for the unconditional release of Mr. Ezimakor by the DSS. “In the alternative, we demand that the Federal Government charges him to court as stipulated in the constitution and give him the opportunity to defend himself,” the statement noted.” The statement wasjointly signed by Charles Oputa,  Deji Adeyanju (Concerned Nigerians), Ariyo Dare Atoye (Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy) and Bako Abdul Usman (Campaign for Democracy). Ezimakor is being held over a story published by Independent alleging improper handling of the Chibok girls’ negotiations by Swiss and Nigerian negotiators.
