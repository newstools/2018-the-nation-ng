National Examination Council (NECO) Registrar Prof. Charles Uwakwe said yesterday the agency will remit N1.2 into the Federation Account this year. Uwakwe, who stated this in a statement in Abuja, said the agency remitted N820 million in two years to the Federal Government. According to him, N500 million and N320 million was remitted to the government in 2016 and 2017. Uwakwe said the National Assembly has urged the agency to improve on its remittance to the Federal Government. To achieve this, he said, the agency has started making efforts to improve on the management of its resources. He said: “We have a mandate to do this therefore. We should be managing the resources that we have very prudently and there is also a bit of pressure on us to be remitting to Federation Account, which we are very cognisant of.”
