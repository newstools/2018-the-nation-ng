The Benue State Government unexpectedly rescheduled Friday’s planned mass burial for the victims of this week’s herdsmen attack in Okpokwu. The 24, including women and children, were killed at Omusu Edimoga. Dozens of others were wounded while some others are missing. Governor Samuel Ortom’s Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, said the mass burial will now take place on Wednesday. He gave no reason for the postponement. He merely said :“a church service, followed by burial of the victims, will take place on Thursday, next week at Okpokwu.” Governor Ortom however announced that President Muhammadu Buhari will visit the state on Monday. It is in continuation of Buhari’s visit to states that recently came under deadly attacks by Fulani herdsmen and militants. He has already visited Taraba and Plateau states. He is also billed to visit Yobe and Zamfara. Benue had in January buried 78 people shot dead by rampaging herdsmen in Guma and Logo local government areas of the state.
