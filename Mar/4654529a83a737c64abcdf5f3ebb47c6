Super Eagles’ captain John Mikel Obi has expressed sadness over missing the two international friendly games between Nigeria and Poland in Wroclaw last Friday and tonight’s game against Serbia inside the Hive Stadium. Mikel wrote on his Instagram page on Monday afternoon that: ”Unfortunately due to circumstances beyond my control, I will not be on the field for our game against Serbia tomorrow (today).  I am sad, and frustrated, but giving my full support to the team for another WIN!???????? #SoarSuperEagles”. Obi Mikel has confirmed that he will not be available for selection in Friday night’s pre-World Cup friendly between Nigeria and Serbia at the Hive Stadium due to ‘circumstances beyond his control’. The official word from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) is that Mikel is absent as he has been working hard at renewing his work permit in China, where he plays for Tianjin Teda. Manager Gernot Rohr confirmed post-match after the victory over Poland that he has invited Porto loanee Mikel Agu to join the team in London due to absence of the former Chelsea ace. The Tianjin Teda number ten last wore the Super Eagles’ jersey in their 4-2 win over Argentina in an international friendly in Krasnodar last November.
