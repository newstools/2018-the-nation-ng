Some Nigerian artistes have joined the ‘Walk for Kids’ campaign a fundraiser for the School Safe Project (SSP) designed to promote child safety. An Eye Masters Eye Center concept, the ‘Walk for Kids’, the annual health campaign targeted at children is an initiative meant to educate the public on the importance of child safety. Speaking on the programme, Dr. Obinna Awiaka, Managing Director of Eye Masters Eye Center and convener, explains that the World Health Organisation has reported that every five minutes a child loses his or her vision; and this vision loss can lead to injury and in some cases death while playing. “Our goal is to give every child an opportunity to have an eye examination and medicated glasses to help them learn and play safely. In the last three years, we provided free eye examination, glasses and treatment to hundreds of children from various orphanages and would like to extend this to children in all schools of the federation ultimately,” he said. Among artistes who turned out to support the walk were Timi Dakolo, comedian MC Abbey. Also joining the walk were kids of celebrities like Tuface and Annie Idibia’s first daughter, Isabella, comedian AY Makun’s daughter and IK Osakioduwa’s son. Speaking on his decision to join the walk, MC Abbey said that it is to ensure that kids have support when it comes to giving them optical attention. Describing it as laudable, he said that it is something that he really wants the private sector to join in and show their support. “I started wearing glasses when I was eight years old. I knew how difficult it was for me and my parents then to be convinced to wear glasses. When I started wearing it, I was called nerd and all that. So ‘Walk for Kids’ is stamping their foot on the ground to ensure that happens,” he said. The event was held in partnership with Lagoon Hospitals, Health Plus, Connect Nigeria, Protection Plus Services Limited, and All Smiles Dental Clinic.
