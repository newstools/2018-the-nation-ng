The Lagos State Police Command has arrested a suspected cyber-criminal cum fraud kingpin, Samuel Olowobola Gboyega. Gboyega, 26, was nabbed on March 1 at 48, Allen Avenue, Ikeja. A statement yesterday by police spokesman Chike Oti, said his arrest followed a petition to the Commissioner of Police by Antonio Kaplanis of the Embassy of Greece, Abuja. Kaplanis alleged that the suspect had fraudulently obtained huge sums of money from unsuspecting Nigerians seeking visa to travel to Europe. Oti said: “The CP deployed detectives from the State Intelligence Bureau (SIB) to fish out the culprit and his partners in crime. The detectives located the suspect’s hideout and carried out a sting operation on him. “During the operation, some Nigerian passports, laptops and other visa-related documents were recovered. “Further scrutiny of the laptop confirmed that there were documents in the notepad that had different embassy visas and their respective price tags. It was also seen that the Gboyega made false presentations through publications on his website: www.kukutravels.com, attaching the name of Embassy of Greece to it. “The CP warned people behind this kind of crime to have a rethink or have the law to contend with.” The suspect, Oti said, has been charged to Ikeja Magistrate Court 2 on March 5. “The boy denied the allegation,” he said.
