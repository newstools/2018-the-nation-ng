Visionscape Sanitation Solutions said there is “no cause for alarm” over the resolution of the Lagos State House of Assembly to summon the executive over the state of waste management in Lagos. The House of Assembly had in a resolution invited the Accountant-General of the state, Mrs Abimbola Umar and  three members of the State Executive Council to brief its ad hoc committee, on all issues surrounding waste management in Lagos and the role and status  of Visionscape. The invited commissioners are Attorney-General and Commissioner of Justice, Mr Adeniji Kazeem; the Commissioner for Finance, Mr Akinyemi Ashade and the Commissioner for Environment, Mr Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti. But in a chat with The Nation, yesterday, a representative of Visionscape, Dipo Wintoki, said the House of Assembly was performing its statutory function and there was no cause for alarm since the firm had a valid contract from government. “The emergence of the contract was done through regular and due process. The Lagos State Government has an obligation to fulfil its part of the contract. The process of awarding the contract to Visionscape was not arbitrary. This will be resolved,” Wintoki said. The Head, Corporate Communications of Visionscape, Motunrayo Elias, explained that in a little while, waste problem will be a thing of the past in the state. She said the firm was consolidating its efforts at delivering the best services to keep the state clean. Part of this consolidation has led to about 100 PSP operators joining hands to work with Visionscape. She said that more vehicles and equipment that will ensure smoother operations of the company would soon be added.
