•Fayemi rallies support for APC Beneficiaries of the N-Power scheme in Ekiti State have pledged to support the re-election of President Muhammadu Buhari, if he declares interest to run in 2019. The beneficiaries said the scheme has lifted them from poverty and saved them from the pangs of unemployment. They spoke at the weekend in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, at the maiden anniversary of the scheme. The Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, urged the beneficiaries to support the All Progressives Congress (APC) in this year’s governorship poll and next year’s general elections. The arrival of Fayemi, who represented the President at the event, elicited a deafening ovation as many of the beneficiaries chanted Ko Duro S’oke (Let It Stay At The Top), the minister’s political slogan. A total of 3,600 beneficiaries in Ekiti State joined the N-Power scheme in 2016 while 8,337 others were admitted into the scheme last year. A beneficiary Biodun Daramola said Buhari had shown commitment to the empowerment of the youth by committing N6 billion as monthly stipends to over 200,000 beneficiaries all over the country. Daramola said: “Because of what our President has done, I want every youth in Nigeria to support this APC government in 2019. “In 2019 general elections, we want all youths in Nigeria to support APC and all youths in Ekiti to support the party in the 2018 governorship election.” Other beneficiaries who testified that the scheme had changed their lives included Feyisayo Falegan, Adesoji Adedeji and Oluseye Odetola. The youths said they used the monthly stipends to set up businesses. The beneficiaries called for the sustenance of the scheme.
