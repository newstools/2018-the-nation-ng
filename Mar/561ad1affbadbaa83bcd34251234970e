Legal luminaries in insurance are set to deliberate on ‘’obsolete’’ insurance laws in the industry. The lawyers will be discussing the way forward for the industry at the 2018 Insurance Lawyers Seminar under the theme: Current Legal Developments in the Nigerian Insurance Industry. The workshop being organised by Adegboyega Adepegba and Co.will hold on March 29, at the Green Legacy Resort, Abeokuta, Ogun State. Professor of Insurance and Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) Joe Irukwu said there was need to review and update the laws to reflect current conditions. He said: “It must be acknowledged that the laws regulating the industry in Nigeria are no longer up to date and need to be reviewed to reflect current conditions. One of the attempts to review the laws in the past and which I was the Chairman of the Law Reform Committee, did a painstaking and thorough job but we are yet to see the expected outcome of the review exercise. “It is encouraging to note that the National Assembly is working on the subject at present and hopefully will soon produce the necessary legislation that will! address the relevant issues.”
