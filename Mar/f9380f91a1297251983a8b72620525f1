Minister of Sports Solomon Dalung has charged the sports federations in the country to make the best use of the lessons learnt in the two day the “International Olympic Committee/NOC seminar on good governance in sports” to move sport to the next level. The Minister who was represented by the Director of Research and Statistics in the Ministry of Youth and Sports, Hawa Kulu Akinyemi, said this while declaring open the IOC seminar yesterday and will end today in Abuja. Dalung disclosed, “I commend the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) for their collaborations and support which ensured successful conduct of the last election into the sports federation. “I believe that the major take away from this seminar is a better understanding of good governance, which I expect you (presidents of sports federations) to translate to better management in your sports, especially the athletes for their better performances”, Dalung stated. IOC member and President of the Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC) Habu Gumel is convinced that “the seminar is a milestone in the annals of Nigerian sports as this happens to be the first time such a high-level seminar is being organised within our shores for presidents and members of our sports federations to address the subject of good governance in our sports system.” The IOC expert, Dr. Donald Rukare, who conducted the seminar, said the major problem in Nigeria was how to get the federations to perform optimally. He expressed believd that the problem would soon be a thing of the past.
