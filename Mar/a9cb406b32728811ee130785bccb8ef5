 That’s the half at the Parc des Princes and it hasn’t been an affair laden with goals.. Yet. Both sides have had chances, with Real Madrid doing so early on but PSG forced some late saves from Keylor Navas, with the aggregate score still 3-1 to Real. Plenty more to come in the next 45 minutes! Pre Match Reports Real Madrid are in pole position to move into the quarter-finals of the UEFA Champions League as they travel to Paris Saint-Germain for the second leg of their last-16 tie. The current European champions hold a two-goal advantage after coming from behind to win the first leg at the Bernabeu, but will have to be wary of complacency. PSG are runaway leaders in the French top flight and with an attack boasting the likes of Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani will have every chance of staging a comeback at the Parc des Princes.
