Chairman of the Ondo State Oil Producing Areas Development (OSOPADEC), Hon. Gbenga Edema, has assured the people of the state that the 51-kilometre Araromi seaside-Akodo-Lekki road, when completed, would facilitate economic development of the coastal communities in the sunshine state. He commended the state governor, Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, for making the project a reality. Speaking with reporters after the take-off ceremony at Araromi in Ilaje local government, Edema said the present administration in the state has laid an unequal foundation to develop the whole state. According to him, the road will open up the whole of the coastline, facilitate transportation in the riverine area and improve the social and economic life of the area. Also, the Chairman of Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), Senator Victor Ndoma-Egba, said the road would help in reducing the travel time from Ondo State to Lagos to an hour and would facilitate the evacuation of agricultural products from Ondo to Lagos. He re-affirmed that the partnership is designed to bring development to the Niger Delta region, saying the project would be completed in record time against the notion that NDDC always abandons projects.
