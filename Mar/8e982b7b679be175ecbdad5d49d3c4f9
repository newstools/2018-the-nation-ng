The Nigeria Institute of Architects (NIA) has developed a blueprint in partnership with state to meet housing needs, the president, Adibe Njoku, has said. He said one of the solutions to the housing problem was involvement of the private sector as a leading driver. Njoku, who spoke in Abuja, on the institute’s efforts to reduce the housing deficit, said the government could intervene by strengthening the capacity of the institute toward building an efficient market. He said NIA has begun a campaign “on this new initiative, meeting the government as part of an enlightenment programmes toward ensuring the success of the innovation geared towards making houses accessible. The NIA president said the initiative was informed by the need to initiate new measures of housing delivery and create jobs for youths. Presenting the blueprint to reporters, Njoku said the geometric growth of cities, fast growth of towns, availability of housing raw materials and rising population of employable professionals in construction, were conditions favouring mass housing development. According to him, NIA has delivered models, such as architectural social housing, architectural commercial housing and public private partnership on which a successful partnership can be built with the Federal Government. Njoku said NIA was promoting a new concept in mass housing with a template  based on mass production to build houses. “This will create an architectural chain in the production process and open access to an array of small and medium enterprises’ (SMEs’) funding at single digit interest rate for component fabrication that will culminate in housing development.” The NIA president urged the Federal Government to collaborate with architects and other professionals to fashion out strategies toward solving the housing shortfall.
