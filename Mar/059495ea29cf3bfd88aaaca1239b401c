A staff of Akoko South East Local Government, Rufus Awolu, who was kidnapped penultimate weekend on his way to Isua- Akoko, has regained his freedom. It was gathered a combined team of police, hunters and residents combed the bush up to the neighbouring Edo and Kogi States for him. It was not clear if he was rescued or paid his abductors ransom. Awolu refused to speak to reporters or share his harrowing experiences while in captivity with anybody. He however was full of praises to God, security agents, local government authority and sympathisers for rescuing him alive. The Police Area Commander for Akokoland, Razak Rauf, an Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) stated another kidnapping attempt was foiled by his men along Akunnu axis. This, according to him, was possible because of new measures introduced by the Command in policing flash points on Akoko roads. He assured criminals would soon meet their waterloo in Akokoland. He noted that all hands were on deck to make the area crime-free. Also, an Assistant Controller of Custom (ACC) attached to Kirikiri Lagos, Dabama Ibrahim, was rescued from kidnappers along Akunu road. He was travelling to Abuja in a Sienna Toyota car marked BDG912X before being waylaid by gunmen. The Police were said to have chased the hoodlums inside the bush to rescue the Custom Officer.

A family source said he went to a bush along Oke-Agbe road and touched an iron rod with life wire on the gun in an attempt to load his dane gun, which sparked fire leading to his death. Symphathisers were said to be trickling in to commiserate with the bereaved family as his body was removed for burial. Efforts to speak with the Police at Arigidi-Akoko were futile at press time.
