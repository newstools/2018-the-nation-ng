The member representing Ethiope at the House of Representatives, Lovette Idisi, has assured Ovu residents in Delta State of more dividends of democracy. He spoke while opening over 80 open market stores in Oviorie-Ovu, Ethiope East Local Government Area. Idisi said he renovated the market to ameliorate the suffering of traders and appealed for their support in 2019. Idisi, accompanied by the council Chairman, Faith Majemite, PDP leaders Chief Mike Adiotomre, Chief Bernard Edewor, the ward councillor, Vwede Orosevwotu and others, said the project is in line with his campaign promises. Addressing market masters and community leaders, he said: “Today, we have come here to commission the renovated Oviorie market to bring to our minds that the interest of the people is most paramount to us and we will continue to do our best. “Government is a process, things are not done overnight, especially when due processes are followed. Now that we have started, other development will follow as requested, and on the borehole at the market, I have instructed my engineers to be on site to ensure the borehole is done soon. “The process may be slow but gradually we are dishing out dividends of democracy to our people in line with our campaign promises, and we are assuring you that more is coming as you vote us back for second term. “My appeal is that we should be patient, most  of the things we appropriated for years, it is now they started working out, and we would say it is better late than never, and that it is not about campaign but doing the right thing at the right time.”
