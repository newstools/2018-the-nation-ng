As part of its Corporate Social Responsibility, especially to indigent members of the public, Newscatle Foods, makers of Nau Nau meal, during the week donated 50 cartons of the product to displaced children  from Otodogbame and Makoko currently undergoing tutorials at Top Goodness School, Iwaya, Yaba, Lagos. The donation was the second of its kind to the pupils. Each donation, according to the Commercial Manager of the company, Nsikan Udo-Osoh,  is used to feed the children over a month. Her words: “We have been doing a lot of CSR  whereby we donate products to people that are in need. We are collaborating with Linking Hands Foundation’s founder, Efe Farinre, who  is assisting displaced children from Makoko to be educated. She was able to get them into the programme by promising to be giving them lunch while in school. We saw she was genuine and donated food to feed the children. During their lunch break, they have Nau Nau. “This is the second time we are donating it to her because when the pupils exhausted the first one, she approached us for another.   Nau Nau is a pioneer product, a ready to eat Nigerian meal, and the first of its kind in the country. It is like  ready-to-eat meals that you find in places like India, USA, UK and so on.  It comes in four variants: jollof rice with chicken, egusi soup with goat meat, fried rice with vegetables and bean porridge. Farinre commended Newscatle Foods for reaching out to the kids, saying their gesture has  in no small measure, encouraged the kids and even the parents to pick interest in education.
