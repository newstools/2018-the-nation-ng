A Group, the Coalition of Registered Political Parties in Kwara State, has urged Senate President Bukola Saraki to ensure that the right person is picked as the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress. The objective, according to the group, is to ensure better development of the state. The association urged the party to pick Ambassador Abdulfatai Gambari as the governorship candidate. The group said that the alleged appalling political and economic situation of the state called for urgent intervention from well-meaning indigenes, especially the Senate president who doubles as the state’s political leader. In a letter to the Senate President  by its coordinator, Alhaji Ahmed Abdullahi, the group said: “the current situation being experienced is far from that which the indigenes of the state had expected.” He added: “The state is economically imbalanced in every facet of human life. Without your recent intervention, the state would have collapsed.” The group said that its vision was to build a virile Kwara State worthy of pride by indigenes. Abdullahi urged the political family to select Ambassador Abdulfatai Yahaya Seriki Gambari as the governorship candidate.. He added: “Ambassador Abdulfatai Yahaya Seriki Gambari hails form Ilorin East Local Government of the state. An astute young man whose political record can be traced back to the 90s as a student, he is now a successful businessman in mining and oil industry. His passion for politics was ignited by your political diplomacy and dynamism. “As a young oil and mining magnate, Ambassador Abdulfatai Yahaya Seriki had influenced  many lives positively, while seeing you as a role model, thereby promoting  the image of our state locally and nationally. “His philanthropy had undoubtedly earned him unparalled honour and respect from the traditional andspiritual leaders, women, youths, friends, allies and cronies in the state.
