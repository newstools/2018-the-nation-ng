Students of Moshood Abiola Polytechnic (MAPOLY), Abeokuta, Ogun State, yesterday protested the non-release of results of final-year Higher National Diploma students. The students, who marched on the streets of Abeokuta, said the authority should release their results to enable them partake in next month’s mobilisation by the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC). The protesters shut the school’s gate at Ojere, preventing academic and management workers from entering the campus. The Nation learnt that the academic workers have been at loggerheads with the government since the conversion of the polytechnic to Moshood Abiola University of Science and Technology. The lecturers refused to mark papers, collate and grade results two months after the students wrote their final exams. The students vowed to keep the gate shut until lecturers released their results. Anti-riot policemen and operatives of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) dispersed the demonstrators. Policemen took over flashpoints, such as Ibara, Panseke, Onikolobo, Iyana-Oluwo and Oloke axis of the state capital to prevent students from regrouping. State Chairman of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Olawale Balogun told reporters that the students were made to go through pains for no fault of theirs. He said: “It is just unfortunate that we’ve found ourselves in this mess. We are suffering for what is none of our business, as we have done our part by writing the exams. “I appeal to members of Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP), MAPOLY branch, to be considerate. We are being maltreated because none of us is a child of the governor or commissioner. The government should also do the needful.” The Chairman of ASUP, Mr. Kola Abiola, declined comment when contacted. He said: “I have no reaction.”
