The General Overseer of Redeemed Christian  Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye, revealed his emotional side  yesterday during a condolence visit  to Benue State on the recent killing of innocent people by herdsmen. Adeboye told Governor Samuel Ortom how he wept in January during the mass burial of 78 victims of the mayhem. “No man of God will see a mass burial anywhere and not feel the pains of the people affected,”  he said. He added: ”Benue State is very, very close to my heart; I had felt every pain you people felt and I wept when I saw you weeping.” Pastor Adeboye, who was accompanied by his wife, Folu, said he was in Makurdi to console and pray for the government and people of the state over the killings by suspected herdsmen. He  said he did not visit the state before the President to avoid unnecessary speculations about his intention. He said:”We want these killings to stop. Happily, we know someone who can stop it. He is the Almighty God; He does not fail or compromise.He is the God of all. “We will continue to call on Him to fight this battle and you can be assured that victory will be certain.” Receiving Adeboye and his entourage, Ortom said the herdsmen’s rampage,apart from causing the deaths of many people, has created a huge humanitarian crisis in the state.
