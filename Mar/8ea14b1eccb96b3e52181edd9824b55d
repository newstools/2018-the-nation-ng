The Lagos State Government yesterday initiated plans to restore Ikeja, the  capital, to its original master plan. The Lagos State Physical Planning Permit Authority (LASPPPA) and the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LASBCA)  served  contravention notices on property owners and occupants for illegally converting them from residential to commercial use.   Buildings which violated the approval originally granted them were also served. About 117 houses on Allen Avenue were asked  to come for regularisation of their documents after being served. Other areas to be affected during the weeklong exercise are Aromire Street, Toyin Street, Isacc John, Joel Ogunnaike Street and Oduduwa Street in the GRA Ikeja, among others. According to LASPPPA General Manager  Olufunmilayo Osifuye, most residential buildings in Ikeja were illegally converted to commercial use. The government, Osifuye said, was not planning to demolish the structures but uncomfortable with the  violation of its  building and planning law. “First and foremost we are regularising those properties. Those who have violated the law and built illegally now have a six month window to do what is expected of them. For instance, if you have built commercial in residential zone, you can now regularise your permit so that you can have legitimacy on the use of the structures,” he said, adding that this scenario was only applicable to areas designated as mixed used areas. Osifuye said the building permits in the affected areas were expected to either be residential, commercial or both,  noting that it was illegal to obtain permit for a particular purpose and use the building for another without regularising the permit. According to him,  from the records of the Lagos State Bureau of Statistics, only 34 percent of property owners have building permits. He said the illegal building conversion had compounded the traffic jam in the axis.
