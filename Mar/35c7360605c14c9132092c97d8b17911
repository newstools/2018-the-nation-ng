The Managing Director of First Nation Airlines, Mr. Kayode Odukoya, was on Friday arraigned before a Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, for alleged theft and forgery by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). He was arraigned on a four- count charge of alleged theft of N1.7 billion and forgery of Certificate of Occupancy (CofO) issued by the Lagos State Government before Justice Mojisola Dada. First Nation Airlines and Bellview Airlines are joined in the suit as second and third defendants. Odukoya, who has failed to appear in court on three occasions, was finally produced in court by the EFCC after he reported at Commissionâ€™s Lagos office on Wednesday. The EFCC counsel, Mr. M.S Usman, alleged that the First Nation MD forged the Memorandum of Loss of Lagos State CofO registered as No. 33 on page 33 volume 1011 at the Lagos State Land Registry, Alausa, Lagos. The forged document was in respect of a property located at No. 29, Oduduwa Street, Ikeja GRA, Lagos.
