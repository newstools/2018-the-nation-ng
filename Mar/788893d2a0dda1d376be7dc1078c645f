VISIONSCAPE and Private Sector Partnership (PSP), now known as Waste Colletctors, have reached an agreement on waste collection in Lagos. Waste operators will now collect residential waste and Visionscape will scale up waste infrastructural development. In addition, the company will continue to provide waste bins and waste bags for all residential customers in partnership with operators of Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA). A statement by Visionscape said: “Rumour has it that a resolution is imminent and that Lagosians will soon breathe a sigh of relief. To paraphrase the late Otunba Gadaffi “dirty business is good business”. “Recall that there was a stalemate as to how the government can achieve its goal on cleaner Lagos Initiative, while the PSP were adamant to support a more robust plan for huge investment on infrastructural upgrade by Visionscapebeyond mere waste collection. “Consequent upon last Thursday’s, all parties have agreed that waste operators will collect residential waste while Visionscape will scale up waste infrastructural development in the best interest of the people. The company will continue to provide waste bins and waste bags for all residential customers in partnership with operators of LAWMA. “The agreement also empowerVisionscape to engage PSPs firstly on a short term basis and perhaps on long-term service arrangement and carry out intervention required to fill service gaps. “Visionscape will continue with its contractual obligation to Lagos State with the waste management infrastructure needed. At present, three transfer loading stations are 90 per cent completed, three service depots are already completed and one engineered landfill is being built.”
