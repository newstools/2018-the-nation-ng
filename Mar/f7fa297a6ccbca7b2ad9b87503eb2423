For the first time in nearly half a century, the top five seeds at last year’s Wimbledon (Andy Murray, Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Stan Wawrinka) were all 30 or older. In the top 100 in the men’s game, 40 of them are 30 or older. The average age of the top 100 is approaching 29. Back in 1990 it was 24. Federer is world number one and just won his 20th slam at the age of 36. Nadal is the third oldest player ever to hold that ranking at the age of 31. Wawrinka won his last slam in his 32nd year and Murray and Djokovic had their best ever years at the age of 29 and 28, respectively. So is it about time we dismiss the notion that a player peaks in their mid to early 20s? Novak Djokovic’s tennis analyst, Craig O’Shannessy, says not only do players peak in their late 20s to early 30s; the likes of Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer have been playing better than ever. “This is the best Roger Federer has ever played,” he said. “He is serving better than ever, 80% and 59% of first and second service points won and his backhand is far better than it was during his ‘peak years’ over 10 years ago. That is why he has been able to dismantle Nadal in a way he never previously could. “Nadal arguably had his best ever clay court swing in 2017. He won 56% of all points that he played last year, which is the first time he has done that. “When he won nine out of 10 French Open’s he was winning 56% of all his points, so that shows how well he was playing. “Novak and Murray all had their best years over 2015 and 2016, when they were 28 and 29 respectively. You don’t just stop improving when you hit 25 – practice makes perfect.”
