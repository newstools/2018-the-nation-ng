The Ibom Specialist Hospital in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, will be handed over to experts in hospital administration, Governor Udom Emmanuel said yesterday. Emmanuel spoke after inspecting equipment at the modern quaternary health centre. He criticised Cardiocare, former managers, for their inexperience, and blamed it for the downward fortune in the hospital. “We cannot put up this kind of facilities and give it to anybody to run. We want to bring people who are experts. These are people who are real hospital administrators. I don’t intend to go and bring a cardiologist and turn him to a hospital administrator overnight,” he said. He maintained that he was undaunted by the blackmail peddled by the former consultants in the media. Emmanuel said he was expecting some consultants from the United States. “They have the experience, they have the technology and they have what it takes. They have the skills. We need to bring them in here and make sure this hospital is fully functional and I want to see that everything is on ground and then we are back to full steam.” The governor expressed happiness that the dialysis unit is functioning, and hoped  the oncology section could also perform well. He said he heard mixed stories about the dialysis centre, but on arrival, he saw a patient being treated and the machines in good condition. “Right now, we have five new machines working so well. Oncology is something that I really really crave to start here because I know how much I spend every month on these facilities outside this country. The machine is not a problem. We’ve actually cost the machines. It’s the consultants now that we are actually trying to recruit.” He promised that the new consultants are from Africa and other parts of the world and are interested in working at the hospital. Acting Medical Director Dr Iniobong Etukudo said there was no equipment for dialysis until intervention of the governor. He commended Emmanuel’s passion to improve health care in the state.
