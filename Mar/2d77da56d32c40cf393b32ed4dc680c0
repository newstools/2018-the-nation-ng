THE Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has warned youths and thugs to desist from acts that can mar the March 24 by-elections in Oshodi and Agege. Its Chairman, Justice Ayotunde Phillips (retd) said the commission would sanction anybody that disrupts the exercise . She spoke during stakeholders’ fora held in Oshodi and Agege on the forthcoming councillorship by-elections into Ward ‘B’ in Oshodi and Ward ‘B’ in Agege. Represented by a LASIEC Commissioner,  Mrs Toyin Ibrahim-Famakinwa, Justice Phillips urged the electorate to elect credible people. According to her, there would be no excuse for people to complain over lack of effective representation if they failed to elect candidates that would best represent their collective interest and aspirations. She enjoined eligible voters to arm themselves with their Permanent Voter’s Card. The LASIEC boss pledged to conduct a free, fair and credible poll. Winners, she said, would be declared at the collation centres. Baale of Dopemu, Alhaji Shitta Afogunlowo, urged the commission to maintain its neutrality as an umpire. Coordinator of the Department of State Service (DSS) for Agege Local Government, Mrs. Helen Okaette, warned that anybody caught with arms, fighting or causing trouble would not go scot-free. Makinde Police Station Divisional Police Officer Akinroye Adesina noted that the police should be notified of any attempt to sabotage the electoral process, promising that they  would act swiftly on such reports.
