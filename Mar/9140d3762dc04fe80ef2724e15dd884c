Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has said the government will partner United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to ensure the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals. Speaking yesterday during a visit by the UNICEF Country Representative, Mr. Mohammed Fall, to the Government House, Port Harcourt, Wike directed government agencies to step up activities. He said his administration had established structures to ensure improvement in immunisation, children and maternal health care and sanitation. The governor lamented that his administration is yet to attain 100 per cent immunisation coverage. He said the Ministry of Health and agencies had been directed to work towards success. “Anything pertaining to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals will be prioritised for the benefit of our people. “We must improve in the areas where we are yet to attain 100 per cent. We must take steps to ensure we move at a pace where everyone will be happy,” Wike said. He added that the government will engage in advocacy in breastfeeding and immunisation. Fall hailed the governor for paying the counterpart funds for United Nations  programmes. He advised partnership with the government to increase areas of cooperation. Fall sought reduction in child and maternal mortality, as well as improved immunisation and breastfeeding so that the state will be a reference point in Nigeria and Southsouth. He said statistics in maternal mortality, child mortality and access to primary education were not encouraging. Fall said if Nigeria attained Sustainable Development Goals, it would impact on the continent.
