The Federal Government has described kidnapping as evil. Secretary to Government of the Federation Boss Mustapha spoke during a stakeholders’ roundtable on improving bail process in the country organised by the Bureau of Public Service Reforms. He said: “With regard to cases of kidnappings, this administration has taken immediate short-term measures to combat this new evil that has crept into our societies. Tighter police methods, swift and severe punishment for those proved to be engaged in kidnapping has been put in place.” Mustapha, who was represented by Permanent Secretary, General Services, Olusegun Adekunle, noted that many Nigerians had misunderstood the process of bail in the country. He said the Federal Government was making efforts to ensure that complaints were responded to on time by the police. He said: “In line with one of the principles of democratic policing, Mr. President has ensured that complaints received from the public are treated within the shortest possible time. Also, in our effort to give boost to the current administration’s war on corruption, the police X-squad has been strengthened to tackle corruption and abuse of office with the police force. “The current administration is making concerted efforts to establish at least one police forensic laboratory in each of the six geo-political zones to enhance their investigation capacity and also establish database in all police station.” Its director-general, Dasuki Arabi, said the roundtable came at the right time when the federal government is trying to ensure effective service delivery by the Nigerian Police Force. “It is my fervent hope that at the end, the BPSR findings and lessons learnt from our study on mapping the process of obtaining bail at the police stations will help improve the bail process,” he said.
