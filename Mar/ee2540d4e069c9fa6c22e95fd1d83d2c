Kenneth Omeruo is set for a permanent departure from English Premier League side Chelsea in the summer at the end of his current loan deal with Turkish top flight side Kasimpasa. Zenit St. Petersburg were close to signing the 24-year-old in February, but their proposal to have him on an initial loan deal was knocked back by Chelsea, who were only keen on an outright transfer. Omeruo has endured six different loan spells since moving to Chelsea in 2013, and with no first team appearance to his team, the club have decided to let go of him for a fee in the region of £5m. With 20 appearances to his name in the Turkish top flight for Kasimpasa and a goal as well, his form has helped put him in the shop window as well as a spot in the Nigeria national team ahead of the World Cup in Russia later this year. Spartak Moscow were also close to signing him in February, but there’s no report of them returning back for him in the summer unlike Zenit who are hoping to snare him in the summer on a permanent basis.
