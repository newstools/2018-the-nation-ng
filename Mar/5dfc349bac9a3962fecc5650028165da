The Lagos State Independent Electoral Commission (LASIEC) has fixed March 24 for the councillorship by-elections into Ward B (Ogunoloko) and Ward B (Dopemu) in Oshodi/ Isolo and Agege Local Government Areas. According to the commission, parties are expected to collect nomination forms  between March 5 and 7. The forms are to be submitted not later than March 13. The register of voters, LASIEC said, would be displayed at the ward collation centres of the affected wards on Friday. The list of validated candidates for the elections would be released on March 21. LASIEC’s Chairman Justice Ayotunde Phillips (retd) enjoined party leaders and other stakeholders to cooperate with the commission to ensure hitchfree by-elections.
