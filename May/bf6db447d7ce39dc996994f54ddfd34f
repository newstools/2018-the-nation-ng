The Lagos Women for Akinwunmi Ambode (LAWAA) has urged women to support the second term bid of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. The group said Ambode had demonstrated a clear commitment to effective and proactive governance which had made Lagos an investment magnet and he should be rewarded with a second term. LAWAA convener Chief (Mrs) Kemi Nelson encouraged the women to spread awareness of Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) collection, with which they can cast their votes for the incumbent in 2019. Nelson, who is also All Progressives Congress (APC) Women Leader (South West), spoke at rally held at Ikeja, where members of the association from five Local Government Areas (LGAs) were presented with cash awards. According to Nelson the cash was sourced independently by the group and was neither received nor sourced from the governor or any of his aides. LAWAA Chairman (Media) Princess Folashade Olabanji-Oba also called on the women to ensure Ambode gets a landslide victory in the 2019 polls. Cheques for N150,000 were awarded to Mushin, Ojokoro and Ifako-Ijaiye being first, second and third place winners in the rally. Surulere got N200,000 as runner up while Ikeja received N250,000 for coming first. Participants included leaders of women in all the LGAs in Lagos among others. Speaking on behalf of the winners of the cash prizes, Chairperson of LAWAA, Ikeja, Mrs Abigail Balogun, promised to mobilise women to ensure a resounding victory for Ambode at the polls.
