The ancient city of Kano went agog, as the Vice President Yemi Osinbajo,  Chief of Army Staff, Lt. General Tukur Buratai, Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Saddiq Abubakar and Corps Marshal, Dr Boboye Oyeyemi, witnessed the turbaning of the Interior minister, General  Abdulrahaman Dambazau, as the new Baraden Kano. Also, Osinbajo witnessed the turbaning ceremony of two other personalities, Dr Aminu Ahmed Sadiq, a retired Assistant Comptroller of Customs, as Zannah Kano and Alhaji Habibu Bello Dankade as Fagacin Kano respectively. Speaking shortly after the turbaning ceremony, the Emir of Kano, Malam Muhammadu Sanusi II said the Emirate Council would ever remain consistent in honouring  the illustrious sons of Kano, who are due for it. Sanusi stressed that the conferment of the titles would serve as a source of inspiration to those who may wish to emulate them for their outstanding contributions. According to him, the three personalities were conferred with the titles considering the spectacular role they had  played in promoting the ideals of the Kano Emirate Council over the years. He said the three eminent personalities had proven their worth in contributing their quota toward the socio-economic and political development of the country in their respective field of  human endeavour at the time when such contributions were most needed. The Emir also counselled the appointees to offer meaningful advice to the Emirate Council and government on issues affecting the wellbeing of the entire people of the state in particular and the country in general.
