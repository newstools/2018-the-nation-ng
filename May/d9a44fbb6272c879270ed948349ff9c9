Unknown gunmen on Sunday attacked the Anglican Bishop of Makurdi, Rt. Rev. N.N. Inyom at Kera after Gondozua Village along Zaki-Biam Road in Benue State. The Bishop was in company of his wife Mrs. Becky Inyom, the Bishop’s Chaplain, Rev. Cletus Iorliam and two others when the incidence occurred at about 1:45pm. A statement by the Diocesan Communicator Terna Umah said that though the Bishop, his wife and the other members were not hurt, the bandits took away his car. Members of the public were urged to give the Police useful information that will lead to the arrest and recovery of the vehicle which is a gold colored Lexus Jeep with number RSH 668 AM ABUJA.
