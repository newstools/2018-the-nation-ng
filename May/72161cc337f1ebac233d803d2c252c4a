He said: “I love my life here in Ekiti, and there is no difference between myself and our people here in Ekiti. I am a product of grace, fear of God is the reason for my successes in life. “Governor Fayose is the people’s governor and he has taught us to associate ourselves with the people. The progress and successes of Governor Fayose is what I shall build upon. Olusola added: “It is a pity hearing that the last administration of APC converted Oodua Textile into lock-up shops, Ekiti is a civil servant state and we are looking for ways to resuscitate the moribund textile industry. “We are encouraging investors to come into Ekiti, paving way for jobs for our teeming youth. We must not sell Ekiti to fraudsters, we must not vote for those that plunged the state into financial mess. “My father (Peter Ayodele fayose) and I are one, and nothing can separate us. Let us vote for continuity.”
