The House of Representatives is set to investigate the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) over the implementation of the $22b Brass Liquefied Natural Gas project. The project was originally set up in 2003 with NNPC owning 49 percent while Conoco Phillips, ENI and Chevron holding 17 percent each. However, Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers) in a motion Thursday said there is a need to investigate the implementation of the project due to several allegations of abuse and mismanagement of funds totalling about $22b meant for take-off and running of the project. He said: “The project has been stuck in the planning stages for more than a decade, with some western partners having pulled out because of tough operating conditions and an unfavourable investment environment. “What should be noted is the fact that the Federal Government’s investment in the Brass LNG project is too enormous to be treated with kid gloves, swept under the carpet or simply put aside with a wave of the hand”. Saying that the Senate in January 2018 raised an alarm over massive fraud in the NNPC as it relates to the Brass LNG project and voted to investigate same, Chinda regretted that nothing happened thereafter. “If not urgently investigated, the essence of the fight against corruption would be defeated and the Nigerian economy and indeed teeming Nigerian masses would be worse for it,” he added. An ad hoc committee to be constituted would carry out the investigation of the expenditure and implementation of the project within six weeks. The motion was unanimously adopted after a voice vote.
