Ahmed Musa is mulling over a return to Russian Premier League club CSKA Moscow in the summer transfer window, according to reports. Championat.com says CSKA head coach Viktor Goncharenko bid farewell to the Nigeria international, who has left the team following the conclusion of the loan agreement between the Muscovites and Leicester City. ”How did I say goodbye to Musa? Warm, soulful. I said to him: “Musa, look how I love you. And when you come again, I’ll still poke you. Come back, we love you all here”, ” said Goncharenko. ”He said he would think. Everybody wants to play in the Champions League, so let’s see.” Musa refused to shake hands with the coach following his substitution in the 58th minute of CSKA’s 2-1 loss to Dinamo in a Moscow derby on April 9 but both master and pupil later settled their differences. The Russia-bound Super Eagles’ star bagged seven goals with three assists in 16 appearances for the Army Men in his second spell with the club.
