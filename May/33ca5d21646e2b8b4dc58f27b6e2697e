Lagos State All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain Olayiwola Isiaq Oba yesterday said he was not part of the parallel congress held at the Airport Hotel, Ikeja. He said the factional congress organised by Fuad Oki was held in error, adding that it did not follow laid down guidelines. Oba said he was surprised that Oki announced his name as the State Assistant Legal Adviser at the parallel congress without his consent. Dissociating himself from the rebellious exercise, he threatened in a statement that he would take a legal action against the rumour mongers. Oba said: “My attention has been drawn to the list of All Progressives Congress (APC) parallel purported elected state executives, led by Fuad Alade Oki, that my name appears on Number 18 of their list as their Assistant State Legal Adviser in their parallel purported election held on May 19. “Ordinarily, I would have ignored because my name is Olayiwola Isiaq Oba, not as inscribed in their list as Lai Oba. But, for avoidance of doubt, coupled with the fact that a lot of my friends and associates have called me on it, I state that it is pertinent for me to clear my name and set the record straight for posterity. “I hereby state that I did not contest undr the above parallel APC congress, led by Fuad Alade Oki. I was not at their election venue and I am not part of their group and will never do anything against the APC-led exco by Alhaji Tunde Balogun. “I dissociate myself from this list and disclaim the position that they claimed I contested for. This is a ploy by my enemy to bring me in conflict with my role model and my amiable leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and that will never happen in the name of Allah.”
