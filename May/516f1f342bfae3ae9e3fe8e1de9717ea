Lagos State Deputy Governor Dr Idiat Oluranti Adebule has hailed Lagosians for their support for the Akinwunmi Ambode-led administration. Adebule assured them that more dividends of democracy are on the way. She attributed the success of Saturday’s All Progressives Congress (APC) congress in the state to the maturity displayed by the party’s leaders. She noted that their insistence on equality of all members as well as free and credible congress helped the party to achieve success in the exercise. Adebule also praised the Congress Committee for ensuring peaceful, free and credible congress. She urged the newly elected party officials at various council areas to carry their members along and mobilise their people at the grassroots to ensure the success of the party in future elections. Accompanied by the Special Adviser to the Governor on Tourism, Arts and Culture, Aramide Giwanson, the deputy governor, who arrived at YMD Gardens, venue of the Ward ‘A’ Congress in Ojo Local Government, hailed delegates for their peaceful conducts. The delegates’ endurance, she said, was an expression of their loyalty to the party and appreciation of good governance in the state. Adebule proceeded to LA Primary School, Iba, venue of the Iba council Congress after monitoring the situation at Ojo Local Government Area. She urged the people to always embrace peace and ensure that they vote only party that catered for their welfare into power. According to her, the best way good governance could be sustained in the country was through active participation of the people in the democratic processes. Adebule urged Lagosians to ensure that they collect their Permanent Voters’ Card (PVC). This, she said, will be their license to determining who should govern them in the future
