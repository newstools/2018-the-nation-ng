The Speaker, Nasarawa State House of Assembly, Ibrahim Balarabe-Abdullahi, said President Muhammadu Buhari still remains the best presidential material for Nigeria in 2019 as the country’s future is assured in his hands as well as considering his laudable achievements in the country. Balarabe-Abdullahi made this known on Monday while answering questions from newsmen in Lafia. The speaker lauded President Muhammadu Buhari and Gov. Tanko Al-Makura over their giant developmental strides which impacted positively on the lives of Nigerians in their three and seven years in office respectively. According to him, President Buhari deserves second term with the feat so far recorded by him especially in the area of fight against corruption, insurgency, and provision of employment opportunities, agriculture, and diversification among others. He said that the opposition cannot get any candidate for now that can beat President Buhari in Nigeria, noting that APC will win with a landslide victory during the 2019 general election. “Nigeria’s future is assured with President Buhari at the helm of affairs and APC under him is unbeatable,” he said. He emphasized that if President Buhari came for the second term, it would move Nigeria to a greater height and would also provide succour to the entire nation as most of the challenges would be tackled. He said the government had impacted positively on the lives of the people of Nasarawa state, hence the need for him to accept calls going by well-meaning citizens to contest for the Senate seat of the southern zone of the state. “Gov. Al-Makura had done creditably well and is still doing his best in improving on the lives of the people of the state and his developmental strides which cut across all sectors of the economy especially in the area of
health, education and agriculture among others”.
