A 30-year-old saleswoman, Blessing Abel, on Friday appeared in a Tinubu Magistrates’ Court, Lagos, for allegedly stealing 4,000 cartons of frozen chicken valued at N5.2 million, property of her employer. Abel is facing a three-count charge of conspiracy, theft and forgery. She, however, pleaded innocence of the offences. But the Police Prosecutor, Insp. Ben Ekundayo insisted that the accused committed the offences on March 13 at Victoria Garden City (VGC), Lekki, Lagos. He alleged that the accused stole 4,000 cartons of frozen chicken valued at N5.2 million belonging to her employer, Mrs Benita Egbuchua. In addition, the accused also forged the invoice and receipt of Silver Stone Farm Ltd, where she is working, and issued the fake receipts to customers. “She also diverted the company’s money to her own account and when she was asked to account for proceeds from the sales, she claimed the customers had not paid.” The offences contravened Section 287 (7), 365 and 411 of the Criminal Law 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Section 287 (7) stipulates seven years imprisonment while Section 411 provides two years for offenders. Magistrate Olumide Fusika granted the accused N1 million bail with two sureties in like sum and adjourned the case until May 25.
