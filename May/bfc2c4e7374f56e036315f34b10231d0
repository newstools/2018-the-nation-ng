Heavens opened again in Ado-Ekiti on Saturday while accreditation was going on at the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship primary election. The rain started at 11.20 am and stopped at 11.41 am. It will be recalled that rain partially disrupted the botched primary held on May 5 at the Oluyemi Kayode Stadium, Ado-Ekiti. The issue of rain was one of the reasons why the Umaru Tanko Al-Makura Electoral Panel opted for an indoor hall at Damlek Event Centre for the rescheduled primary. Big canopies were provided for delegates outside the hall to give them convenience. Accreditation still ongoing, voting yet to commence.
