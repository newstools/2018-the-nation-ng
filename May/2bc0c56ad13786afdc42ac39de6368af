The Sambalisa community in Birninkudu Local Government Area of Jigawa has appealed to Gov. Muhammad Badaru to build the community road to ease transportation in the area. Mr Abdu Sabo, the Chairman of the Sambalisa Community Development Association made the appeal in an interview with the News men in Dutse on Tuesday. Sabo said that the people of the area were predominantly farmers but had difficulty transporting their produce from the community to the cities. “Our main concern is road. Every year, after harvesting our farm produce, we usually have difficulty moving our harvest to markets in the cities,” he said. He regretted that the community lacked basic infrastructure and social amenities, adding that the people had yet to enjoy the dividends of democracy. Sabo said, “We are therefore appealing to the state government to construct our roads for us.” “We made a lot of entreaties to previous administrations in the state but all failed on deaf ears.”  We are also indigenes of Jigawa but we are being neglected by successive administrations in the state. “If our road is constructed, we shall remain very grateful because we want to enjoy the dividend of democracy like other communities around us,” he said. He further said that beyond the ease of transportation, they needed good roads to link up the community with its neighbours. NAN
