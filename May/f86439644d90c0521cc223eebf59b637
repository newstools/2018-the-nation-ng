Director of ‘Isoken’, the acclaimed third highest grossing Nigerian film last year, Jade Osiberu, has announced her next film, ‘Nigerian Trade’, which she says is inspired by true events. She also disclosed that the film, a fast paced crime drama is based on extensive research on kidnap for ransom in Nigeria. According to the director of popular TV series, ‘Gidi Up’, “We have been researching this project for about a year now and I’m really excited, first because reality is sometimes even more gripping than fiction and that’s certainly the case for Nigerian Trade and then because the studio’s (Foresight Global Films) ambition is to make a film set in Nigeria that can truly compete internationally.” Written by award-winning screenwriter, Yinka Ogun and produced by Foresight Global Films, “Nigerian Trade” tells the story of Dike Maduka, aka Eric, a notorious genius billionaire kidnapper, who has evaded arrest for two decades, and the high-stakes investigation into his activities led by fast rising police officer and head of the Intelligence Response Team (IRT), Superintendent Khalid Abubakar. Osiberu noted that, “According to African Insurance Organization, in 2016 Nigeria overtook Colombia and Mexico as the global capital for Kidnap for Ransom, and as terrifying as this is, it’s a big informal albeit illegal industry, with a thriving business model and multiple target markets.”
