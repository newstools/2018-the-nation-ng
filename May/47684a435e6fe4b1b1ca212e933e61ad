Eko Electricity Distribution Company Plc (EKEDC) on Monday donated 500 rain jackets to the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) in ensuring proper waste management across the state. Its Chief Executive Officer, Adeoye Fadeyibi, said the donation was a little way of contributing to the environment where EKEDC do business. Fadeyibi, who was represented by the company’s Chief Human Resources Officer, Aik Alenkhe, said the company would continue to support LAWMA’s initiatives geared towards ensuring cleanliness of Lagos. “We are not just doing this because we are in business but to impacts on the environment where we do business. The essence is to enhance our society in ensuring that we make more positive impacts in the environment where we do business,” he said. The EKEDC boss said the company is also working towards extending its CSR initiatives programmes to other corporate organisations in the State, like Lagos State Transport Management Authority (LASTMA). “As I speak today, we are also planning similar initiative with LASTMA; you can see that there is a huge gap, whenever there is heavy down pour, LASMA personnel working on the highway often hid for rain. “This is one of the thing we are also working on how we can we also support  the agency’s personnel   for effective control of traffic during the raining season, which is part of the company’s CSR initiatives,’’ Fadeyibi added. LAWMA General Manager Segun Adeniji said the gesture means the EKEDC cares and it also an expression of their CSR to support the state in keeping it clean and improve the welfare of our workers.
