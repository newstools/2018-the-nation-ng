Finance Minister, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, yesterday said the Federal Government would mobilise more revenues to drive its growth plan for the economy. A statement endorsed by the Special Adviser on Media and Communications to the minister, Oluyinka Akintunde, explained that Mrs Adeosun spoke in Abuja during a meeting with a World Bank Mission of 10 Executive Directors led by Mr. Patrizio Pagano. She said the government would accelerate  growth level and improve the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in the country. “The Nigerian Government is working towards accelerating the country’s growth level. The growth will be underpinned by stimulating the ‘Ease of Doing Business’ in Nigeria and improving our capital expenditure which we have done in the last two years. “Nigerians should trust the government to deliver on its promises of improving the economy and providing sustainable infrastructure development. We are very optimistic but we will remain vigilant,” Adeosun said.
