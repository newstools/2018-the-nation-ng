•’Governor judging others by his standards’ Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike alleged yesterday that the  Federal Government was plotting his assasination. The governor spoke at the third anniversary thanksgiving of his administration at the Living Faith Church in D-Line, Port Harcourt. He said: “Intelligence report available to us as at this morning indicate that they are plotting to assassinate me in a crowd and claim it was accidental discharge.” The governor said the plot of the APC Federal Government and its associates will not intimidate him as he remains committed to the defence of democracy and Rivers State. He said the plot would fail, because God would continue to defend him. “The level of conspiracy against Rivers State is unfortunate.  Instead of focusing on governance, they focus  on how to assassinate me or frame me up.” Wike claimed the APC Federal Government, through the inspector general of Police, plotted to plant millions of dollars and AK 47 at his Abuja residence, when the Police sought search warrant from an Abuja court. But Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity Femi Adesina said: “It is not in the Buhari administration’s character. “Wike is judging others by his own standards. Rivers State has witnessed in recent times gruesome murders which the state has not been able to explain.”
