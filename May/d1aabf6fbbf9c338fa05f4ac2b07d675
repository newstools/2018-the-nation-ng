The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said on Friday the Commission spent only N100million on the failed bid to recall the Senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District, Dino Melaye. Yakubu said at a press conference in Abuja that the figure was nowhere near the N100billion reported in several quarters. He said: “A recall exercise is just like conducting a Senatorial election. The Kogi-West which Melaye represents has 552 polling units and seven local governments.”
