As part of its contributions towards the development of social skills especially among women, Lift Above Poverty Organization (LAPO) has empowered 19,124 women with social development skills. LAPO said this would enable them (women) to overcome the socio-cultural and traditional inhibitions militating against their progress and realization of their aspirations. The Executive Director of the organisation, Sabina Idowu-Osehobo, in a statement, expressed concerns that a lot of women were discriminated against in the society, marginalized and excluded from life transforming opportunities. Idowu-Osehobo, said sustainable development could not be achieved without women inclusion. According to her, LAPO is committed to the dismantling of structures and processes that encourage discrimination, injustice and violence against women, adding that gender-based discrimination permeates all cultures, and often manifests in laws, policies, and practices of institutions. It is noteworthy that LAPO has been in the forefront of bringing gender issues to wider attention, promoting legal and policy reforms and supporting projects that empower women economically. In the same vein, the organisation has trained 103,437 under its Business Management Training project. LAPO said the purpose of the training was to enable them manage their businesses more successfully. “The training is expected to strengthen their capacity to develop long-term vision for their businesses, maintain good customer relations, develop sustainable plans, keep appropriate book of accounts and manage their financial records. “The training commenced in Mid-West Zone in Benin City, Edo state with 12 experienced facilitators. Features of the project include lectures, practical training and experience sharing,” the statement said.
