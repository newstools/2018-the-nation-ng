The Kogi State High Court sitting in Lokoja, on Friday ordered that the Senator representing Kogi West be moved the National Hospital Abuja. The judge also adjourned till Monday 7th May, for continuation of hearing in a written bail application filled by his counsel, Chief Mike Ozekhome (SAN), asking for variation of the remand order placed him. This followed Thursday’s refusal to grant bail to the Senator Melaye, when he was arraigned before the Senior Magistrate Court 2, sitting in Lokoja on a seven-count charge bothering on criminal conspiracy and illegal possession of fire arms. The Chief Justice of Kogi State, Justice Nasir Ajanah who presided over the proceedings, said that in view of the critical health conditions as espoused by the counsel to the applicant, he should be moved to the National Hospital, Abuja for proper medical attention. Earlier, counsel to the defendant, Chief Ozekhome had argued that Senator Melaye is a chronic asthmatic patient who gasped for breath on Thursday while being arraigned and had to be given his inhaler right there in the courtroom and in the presence of the trial magistrate, Sulyman Abdaklah.
