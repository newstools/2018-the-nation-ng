BARAK SHACHAH started in 2014 under the leading of our founder and Convener, Gbadebo Dapo with the help of many musical friends. The Concert has grown from the first couple years in the local church, to downtown Lagos and now to an even bigger event on our quest to become a major destination Worship and Praise Concert drawing people from all over the country. Barak Shachah is a free musical concert where everyone is not only entertained but ministered to. The vision of the convener is to bring people to God and guide them to present their desires to God through singing. The goal from the beginning has been to stage a worship concert that enables worshippers express their love and total surrender to God. BARAK SHACHAH started off at the Masters Place, Redeemed Christian Church of God of Gbagada.
