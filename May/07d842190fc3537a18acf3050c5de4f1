The Butchers Stakeholders’ Forum (BSF) has denied media reports that human parts are sold at Oko-Oba Abattoir in Lagos. The reports, according to the forum, also claimed that there were underage prostitutes at the abattoir. At a briefing yesterday, the United Butchers Association (UBA) Chairman Alhaji Umar Adam described the reports as high level of unprofessional journalism. He said they were attempts to disparage the butchers, tarnish their image and reputation. Adam said the reports could discourage the public from patronising the abattoir. He said legal action would be taken against the media organisation. The Chairman, Caretaker Committee, Lagos State Butchers Association, Alhaji Malomo Yusuf, said the reports dented the abattoir’s image.
