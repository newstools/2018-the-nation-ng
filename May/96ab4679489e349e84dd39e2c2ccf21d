The new episode of Television drama series, Professor Johnbull, sponsored by Globacom is seeking the infusion of richer lyrics into local music as it was in the past. The episode also highlights some of the struggles artistes go through to make it in the star-studded industry, especially the challenges they face when more talented singers enter the industry. The episode features two Nollywood actors, Harry Anyanwu, who acts as Lemmy Cardisson and Emeka Okoro (Roy Zinga), both representing the old school music icons, playing Soul, Country Songs and Highlife. It also features regular stars, Flash (Stephen Odimgbe) and Jeroboam (Osita Iheme), who combine all the genres of music and blend them with native flavour to produce a new class of hip hop tagged Hip Life. The episode, entitled Hip Life, showcases the spontaneity of the new music genre and the relentless spirit of the old school musicians. The episode also features the legendary Nollywood actor, Richard Mofe-Damijo (RMD), whose quest to establish a record label and sign on new musical acts stokes the fire of competition and enmity between the old and the new schools.
