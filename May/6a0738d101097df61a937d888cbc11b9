Super Eagles’ goalkeeper Francis Uzoho kept his 13th clean sheet for RC Deportivo Fabril who defeated Rapido de Bouzas 2-0 on Sunday, as he continues to stake a claim for a place in the Nigerian squad to the World Cup. The game was the 23rd of the season for Uzoho, who has conceded 17 goals so far this term for RC Deportivo Fabril who are second in the Spanish Segunda B division, the third tier. The 19-year-old made his debut for Nigeria in last year’s international friendly against Argentina, coming off the bench for the second half as the Super Eagles beat the Albiceleste 4-2. He was also in goal for Nigeria in the recent friendly games against Poland and Serbia in Wroclaw and London respectively and looks sure to be on the plane to Russia.
