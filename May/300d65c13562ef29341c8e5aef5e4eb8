*Give Nigeria , Egypt slim chance Some African fans in a recent poll believe none of the continent’s representatives to the 2018 FIFA World Cup is capable of winning the tournament but have rather predicted Brazil or Germany to lift the trophy.

In poll took a new dimension in South Africa, where 26 per cent of men believe Brazil will come out glorious, and 26 percent believe Germany will carry the day, but 20 per cent of the women predict victory for Brazil while just 13 per cent think Germany will win. From Africa’s five qualifying teams of Egypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal, and Tunisia, the South African public is expecting little, with the greatest hopes being the 1 per cent of men and 3 per cent of women predicting a Nigerian win. But in Nigeria and Senegal, football followers see it differently. While 43 per cent of the men of both nations, tip their teams to clinch title. In Nigeria, 44 per cent of the women are of the same view in predicting a Nigerian win. The greatest patriotism and optimism however comes from the v Senegalese women with 66 per cent of them tipping the Taranga Lions to win the Cup.
