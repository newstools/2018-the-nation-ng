One hundred pupils of Idogbo Secondary School, Benin, Edo State, were trafficked to Libya in the last four months, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Godwin Obaseki on Human Trafficking and Illegal Migration Mr. Solomon Okoduwa has said. Speaking in Benin during an advocacy programme, Okoduwa said teachers in the school, concerned about how the college had become a harvest ground for traffickers, gave him the figure. He said the government would not allow the evil to thrive. “The government will step up its campaign against trafficking. The Task Force Against Human Trafficking will be on the trail of the human traffickers,” the aide said. He warned pupils to be wary of the antics of traffickers, who are bent on deceiving them to embark on dangerous journeys. “Henceforth, report anyone who tells you to travel to Europe. They are simply taking you through Sahara Desert and the Mediterranean Sea and you may eventually end up in Libya. “The number of pupils who have been trafficked from your school in this short period is overwhelming. “The truth is that many of them might have been imprisoned there or facing one challenge or the other. “Taking the route of Sahara Desert and other illegal routes is hellish. “Many died of hunger,  many were drowned in Mediterranean Sea while in search of greener pastures. “Worse still, the families of those people who died on their journey were made to pay for the travel expenses, when unknown to them, their loved ones have gone to the great beyond. “If anyone tells you to travel abroad through Libya, tell him or her capital ‘NO’.  If you must travel for any reason,  travel the right way.” NAN reports the government received 3,400 Libya returnees in the last six months.
