FBNQuest Merchant Bank, the investment banking and asset management subsidiary of FBN Holdings Plc, has received accolades from global financial and capital market awarding institutions in recognition of the impact and size of transactions it delivered in 2017. The firm has won five awards in various categories of the EMEAFinance Achievement Awards, including ‘Best Local Currency Bond House’ and ‘Best Social Development Bond’ for its role in Mixta Real Estate’s $4.5 billion Senior Guaranteed Fixed Rate Bonds; Most Innovative Naira Bond for the $300 million Inaugural SEC-Registered Diaspora Bond; ‘Best Mergers and Acquisition Deal’ for the Divestment of AMCON’s 100 per cent Shareholding in Keystone Bank; and ‘Best Naira Bond’ for its role as one of the financial advisers on the Federal Government of Nigeria’s N100b 7-year Inaugural Sovereign Sukuk. The bank was also recognized for the Federal Government of Nigeria’s Sukuk transaction by The Banker’s Deal of the Year Awards, receiving the ‘Deal of the Year – Africa’ award. The innovative transaction, which was a debut Sukuk issuance by the Federal Government, had no precedent to provide a benchmark and no explicit guidelines within the general regulatory framework. Nevertheless, through diligent structuring and positioning, the offer received a strong market reception and was oversubscribed, with PFAs, Banks and Asset/Fund Managers accounting for over 70 per cent. Proceeds from the issue are allocated to the construction and rehabilitation of 25 roads across the country. The bank was also recently awarded the ‘Best Investment Bank in Nigeria’ by Global Finance Magazine. Commenting on the achievements, Managing Director, Kayode Akinkugbe said “We are proud of these accomplishments and how we have been able to deliver impact by working with our partners.
