Senator Jonah Jang (Plateau North) has been quizzed by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) over an alleged N5.6billion fraud. The alleged fraud was reportedly perpetrated during his tenure as Plateau State governor between 2007 and 2015. In a statement on its website, the commission said it had concluded interactions with the ex-governor although investigation “continues on other strands of the matter’’. It did not give further details, according to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report. The ICPC on March 22, threatened to declare Jang wanted for allegedly ignoring its invitation. The ICPC, through a statement signed by its spokesperson Mrs Rasheedat Okoduwa said Jang had been evasive since October 2017, when it opened investigation into alleged corruption-related activities during his tenure. Jang reacted through a statement by his media aide, Mr Clinton Garuba, on March 23 that there had “never been a time “the commission invited him”.
