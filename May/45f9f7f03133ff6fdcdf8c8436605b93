The Lagos State Government will prosecute a lawyer, Mrs Udeme Otike-Odibi, for allegedly killing her husband, Sym, 56, Commissioner for Justice and Attorney-General Adeniji Kazeem said yesterday. The husband was also a lawyer. Kazeem told reporters at his ministry’s conference room that the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) found the suspect culpable of the offence. According to him, “facts available in the file show that the suspect, subsequent to her stabbing her husband, also mutilated his corpse by cutting the genitals.” Though the suspect was arraigned by the police before Chief Magistrate Bukola Kikelomo Ayeye on a one-count charge of murder two weeks ago, Kazeem said she will now stand trial at their high court. “The trial of Mrs Otike-Odibi, 47, will commence as soon as the case file is assigned to a court by the Chief Judge. This office will ensure expeditious trial of this matter.” Kazeem urged residents to report any case of violence in their area by dialling a short code 6820 or 08137960048. The government, he said, was disheartened by the rising cases of domestic violence in the state. “The Lagos government wishes to express dismay at the rising rate of domestic violence in the state. The good citizens of Lagos are enjoined to fulfil their roles as compulsory reporters by ensuring that any case of domestic violence is immediately reported to the police, Domestic and Sexual Violence Response Team or any other relevant authority to avoid unnecessary loss of lives.” He urged Lagosians to desist from act of violence, noting that anybody found culpable would face the law.
