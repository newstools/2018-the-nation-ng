The Commonwealth of Learning (COL) President and CEO, Prof Asha Kanwar, has suggested three policy approaches to ensure that more girls have access to quality schooling. Speaking at the Commonwealth Women’s Forum in London, she said focusing on open, distance and technology-based learning (ODL), as well as on the development of social capital, and political will among stakeholders will expose more girls to education. “COL is committed to promoting ‘learning for sustainable development’ and women’s equality and empowerment are central to that vision,” said Kanwar. COL addresses the many barriers to girls’ education effectively through innovative approaches to overcome the constraints of resources, environment and society. Kanwar highlighted some examples of how open schools and distance learning allow learners to study at their own pace, place and time, saving on substantial opportunity costs for the families. COL in collaboration with UNICEF implemented the Child Friendly School model in Nigeria. This model aims to improve the quality of learning by providing safety and security, sanitation, and child-centered teaching methodologies. A study of a COL-supported open school in Belize revealed that every dollar invested has resulted in $8 worth of perceived benefits to the girls. COL trains adolescent girls for livelihoods and focuses on sensitising the communities and families first.
