Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has praised Nigerian entertainers for their creativity and job creation. He spoke at The Platform, a programme organised by The Covenant Place which had as its theme, ‘Get Involved.’ At the event which held in Iganmu, Lagos, Osinbajo said the task of nation-building is unending. “The builders confront new problems every day,” he said. “Today, we are confronted with the remnants of Boko Haram, the farmer/herdsman clashes with the potential of ethnoreligious conflict. And we have to feed ourselves, we provide millions of new jobs as everyday, more people are added to the population. The job of the builder is not to complain.” Earlier in his speech, the Vice President recognized the creative talents of the entertainment sector and gave kudos to the likes of Don Jazzy of Mavin Records, Banky W, Olamide, Davido, Elenu, Tiwa Savage, and Mo Abudu among others, for putting Nigeria on the global entertainment map. He also praised Jason Njoku of Iroko TV who created an online streaming portal that showcased Nollywood to the world. Speaking on the way out, Osinbajo said the solution lies in building the Nigerian bridge. “It is one that would be built on the strongest materials of all – our will to excel as Nigerians, our commitment to build a new society, men and women of a new Nigerian tribe.” The VP rounded off his speech by giving ‘accolades’ to hardworking Nigerians to which he received a thunderous applause from the crowd.
