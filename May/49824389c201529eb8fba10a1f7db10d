.Court extends suspect’s remand by 51 days A Yaba Chief Magistrates’ Court in Lagos on Tuesday extended by 51 days the remand of Danish national, Peter Nielsen, following a Directorate of Public Prosecutions (DPP) report which indicted him for murder. Nielsen, 53, is suspected of killing his singer wife, Zainab Nielsen, and their three-and-a-half-year-old daughter, Petra on April 5, at their Banana Island, Lagos home.
Chief Magistrate Kikelomo Ayeye granted the remand extension to enable the prosecution file a charge against Nielsen at the Lagos High Court, which has the jurisdiction to try murder. The DPP’s advice marked April 19, was tendered in court alongside the application for an extension of Nielsen’s remand, by prosecuting counsel Effiong Asuquo, a Chief Superintendent of Police (CSP). It reads in part: “After carefully considering the facts available in the duplicate case file, this office is of the considered opinion that a prima facie case of murder contrary to Sections 223, of the Criminal Law, Laws of Lagos State, 2015, exists against the suspect, Peter Nielsen.” Mrs Ayeye adjourned the case till June 28, for mention. On April 11, Nielsen was brought before the court on a two-count temporary charge of unlawful killing. It reads in part: “That you Peter Nielsen, male, on April 5, 2018 at Block 4, Flat 17, Bella Vista Tower, Banana Island, Ikoyi, Lagos, did unlawfully kill your wife, one Zainab Nielsen, aged 37 years and your daughter, Petra Nielsen, aged three- and-a-half years” His plea was not taken as the court had no jurisdiction over the matter, rather Nielsen was remanded at the police’s request. Last year, Zainab, alias Alizee, signed a two-year record deal with an Asian record label, Petra Entertainment. The deal reportedly earned the Kogi State native a new Ford explorer SUV, a house on Banana Island and international distribution with affiliates of her record company in Asia. In January, she released a single, ‘Alhaji Musa’.
