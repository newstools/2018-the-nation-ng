Senator Andrew Uchendu (Rivers East) has said Governor Nyesom Wike is at war with his conscience because he betrayed his benefactor, Rotimi Amaechi. Uchendu, in a statement by his media aide, Solomon Okocha, described Wike’s decision to work against Amaechi as shocking. He was reacting to Wike’s allegation that he (Uchendu) was at war with his conscience over the sack of Senator George Sekibo by the Court of Appeal. Uchendu said: “I am not at war with my conscience over my electoral victory because the same judiciary that ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to withdraw the George Sekibo’s certificate of return declared Wike governor of Rivers State, even after the Supreme Court described the 2015 election as a theatre of war. “If there is anybody who is fighting with his conscience, it should be Wike who, after so many years of eating from the same plate with his former master, Amaechi, betrayed him like the Biblical Judas Iscariot because of inordinate political ambition. “After treating Amaechi in such a manner, Wike has no moral right to talk about who has conscience or not. Wike’s conscience is also troubling him, because the six police officers, who he used to invade the Rivers East collation centre, to ensure I was not declared the winner of the rerun, have all been dismissed. “The sack of the 23 INEC officials, who confessed to have received N360 million from Wike to rig the polls must be a terrible burden on his conscience. “It is unfortunate that Wike, who did not contest any election with me, has continued to wail on my opponent’s behalf. This is simply a case of one crying more than the bereaved. If Wike is not satisfied with the court’s judgment, he should get ready to meet me in the field, if I eventually get my party’s ticket to contest in 2019.”
