Former Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson no longer needs intensive care and will continue rehabilitation as an inpatient, the club said via its twitter handle @ManUtd on Wednesday. Ferguson had undergone an emergency brain haemorrhage surgery last Saturday and said to have been in intensive care to aid his recovery. “Sir Alex no longer needs intensive care and will continue rehabilitation as an inpatient. “His family have been overwhelmed by the level of support and good wishes but continue to request privacy as this will be vital during this next stage of recovery,” the tweet read. The Scottish won 38 trophies for the club in his 26 year reign as manager.
