THE Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC)  has secured 603 convictions in three years. The agency also claimed that it has altered the narrative of the fight against corruption in Nigeria through aggressive tracing and recovery of stolen assets. The commission, in a statement yesterday by its Head of Media and Publicity, Mr. Wilson Uwujaren, said: “As Nigeria marks the third anniversary of the President Muhammadu Buhari administration, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has recorded a total of 603 convictions between 2015 and May 29, 2018. “The figure is the aggregate of the 103, 195 and 189 convictions recorded in 2015, 2016 and 2017 respectively. “It also includes the 116 convictions recorded in the first five months of this year. “President Buhari was elected three years ago on a ticket that pledged to address the monster called corruption. “The EFCC under the leadership of Ibrahim Magu is the lead agency driving the anti-corruption agenda of the administration.” It added: “The groundbreaking conviction record of the commission is more salutary given that it includes the conviction, for the first time in the history of the country, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Joseph Nwobike. “For the first time too, judges and top military officers, including retired Service Chiefs, are being prosecuted for corrupt enrichment. “The EFCC has literally altered the narrative of the fight against corruption in Nigeria through aggressive tracing and recovery of stolen assets. “Over N500 billion has been recovered in the last three years by the agency while the impunity with which public funds is stolen has been curtailed substantially as people have come to the realisation that there are consequences, if one is found to have illegally dipped hands in the public till.”
