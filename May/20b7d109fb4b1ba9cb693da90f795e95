Super Eagles striker, Alex Iwobi has declared that he is fully prepared for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. He strongly believes that he will do well in the mundial. Iwobi, whose goal sealed Nigeria’s place in the World Cup, in the 1-0 victory over Zambia on 7th October 2017, told FIFA.Com that he knows what to expect in his first appearance at the biggest football tournament on earth, going by the regular trainings he has received with world-class players. “The fact that I have been training with world-class players every day has given me a bit of experience, so I know what to expect in Russia,” Iwobi said. “The intensity I train at with Arsenal is very high, so I’m preparing in a good way. “It was always my dream as a kid, so I can’t wait to be involved. I’m looking forward to the atmosphere and wearing the colours of Nigeria. I feel like I can do well.” Speaking on his reactions to the goal that qualified the Super Eagles to the World Cup, Iwobi said he would never have guessed doing something like that early in his career. “It is difficult to describe, as the feeling was crazy. I remember looking at the crowd and seeing my parents jumping. I almost cried, it was emotional. I would never have guessed that I would do something like that so early in my career. I had dreams about it, but the fact that my dreams came true – I can’t put into words how I felt. “After the game I went to the hotel and my mum and dad were both there. Just seeing them, I almost burst into tears again.” Nigeria begins their 2018 FIFA World Cup campaign against Croatia on 16th June, then they book a date against Iceland on 22nd June, four days before their final group match against familiar foes, Argentina whom the Eagles have lost to by a one-goal margin in four previous meetings at the World Cup.
