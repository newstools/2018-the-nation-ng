He was requested to return for a meeting which he agreed to do. He is expected back on Saturday and “on his return, the President’s two-day state visit to Jigawa (State), which was postponed because of the All Progressives Congress, APC’s Ward Congresses, will now take place on Monday and Tuesday..” The President spent 104 days on medical holiday in 2017.
