The European ( Union EU ) on Wednesday in Daura, Katsina State, started a three-day training of 130 farmers in agro-forestry initiatives. Dr Chris Udokang, the EU Project Manager, who declared the training open, said that it was aimed at educating the participants on how to generate appreciable revenue from tree products and non-timber forest products. He said that the project was executed by the Fuel Wood Balance programme ( FUWOBA ), in collaboration with Oxfam, International Centre for Energy, Environment and Development ( ICEED ) and the National Planning Commission. Udokang said that the project had encouraged and supervised the planting of 21 species of assorted trees across the seven participating local government areas of Katsina State. He said that under the project, about 6.54 million trees were planted across the local government areas in the last three years, adding that the tree-planting scheme would be expanded cover more rural communities. Malam Buhari Fago, the Director of Agriculture in Daura Local Government Council, said that training was timely and vital to the socio-economic life of the people, particularly those in the rural areas. He said that the project had spurred many women to get involved in home gardening, adding that the women cultivated cashew, moringa, mango and other economic trees. Also speaking, Malam Sani Mashi, an official of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria ( MACBAN ), said that the project had also trained 700 cattle breeders in certain forestry initiatives. “It also helped us to engage in proper open range demarcation, which has since averted unnecessary clashes between our members and farmers,’’ he said. The newsmen reports that the local government areas which are participating in the project are Daura, Maiadua, Baure, Zango, Mashi, Sandamu and Dutsi local council areas
