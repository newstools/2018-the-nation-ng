An Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) delegate, Jimoh Azeez, has threatened a court action, if the votes cast at the botched primary were not validated. Azeez said the ballot he cast at the primary for one of the aspirants, Dr. Kayode Fayemi, should not be anulled as it would violate his constitutional rights. Fayemi’s agent at the shadow poll, Samuel Abejide, accused the security men of allowing thugs to disrupt the exercise. They spoke at a news conference  in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. Other delegates who spoke with reporters are Dada Ebenezer and Emmanuel Adekunle. The primary was disrupted by suspected hoodlums when voting was underway. He said delegates from Ekiti East, Moba , Ilejemeje , Ado and Ijero local governments had voted before the poll was disrupted. Fayemi’s agent  denied the allegation that the committee apportioned more than required number of agents to the former governor. Abejide said: “We believe the process of election  was free, fair and credible and that is why the results should be sustained. “If they knew that they were leading, why  should they ask for cancellation?” Jimoh said: “I am a delegate in APC and I voted during the election. The process in those mentioned local governments were free and fair. So, I don’t expect the party to annul it. “Though, should the party go ahead and do that, I will not hesitate to go to court to seek redress.”
