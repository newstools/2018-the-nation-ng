A 41 year old man, Dele Mokwunye, who is on death row, has appealed for a State pardon. He expressed remorse for his actions. He blamed his actions on “temptation”. The convict was sentenced to death by hanging by Justice Anthony Akpovi of Ogwashi -Uku High Court in 2006. Dele Mokwunye, a native of Idumuje-Unor of Aniocha North Local Government Area was 24 years old in 2002 when he brutally murdered his childless aunt with whom he was residing. He butchered the aunt with a cutlass on suspicion that she was using witchcraft powers to hinder his progress. His father gave evidence against him during the trial. The convict, whose death sentence has been commuted by the former Governor of the State, Dr. Emmanuel Uduaghan in 2010, is currently serving his jail term at the Onitsha Prison. Mokwunye made the appeal, Friday, during a visit by the Chairman of the Delta State Advisory Council on the Prerogative of Mercy, Chief Patrick Okpakpor who led other members of the Council to the Onitsha Prison. Okpakpor told convicts transferred to the Onitsha and Awka prisons from Delta State that the council lacks the power to order release of inmates from custody. He further explained that such powers reside with the Governor as enshrined in Section 212 of the 1999 Constitution (as amended). Okpakpor said the quarterly prison visitation exercise of the council was not only restricted to prisons within Delta State but to such other prisons across the Federation where indigenes and none indigenes alike, convicted by Delta State High Court are serving their terms of imprisonment. The council appealed with authorities of Awka Prisons to consider the transfer of the three inmates of Delta State origin to Onitsha Prison or back to Warri prison to enable their families have access to them.
