The Federal High Court in Lagos on Wednesday dismissed an application filed by a Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr. Dele Belgore, who urged the court to compel the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to produce all the statements he made to the Commission. EFCC charged Belgore, former Minister of National Planning, Prof. Abubakar Suleiman and former Minister of Petroleum Resources, Mrs. Diezani Alison-Madueke, who is said to be “at large”, with money laundering. The court had dismissed the defendants’ no-case submission, after which Belgore’s lawyer asked the court to order the EFCC to produce other statements he made that were not tendered in court. His lawyer, Seni Adio (SAN), argued that the additional statements were needed to enable Belgore defend himself in court. He said: “The defendant knows how many statements he made. We need those statements to be complete and on record.” Ruling on Wednesday, Justice Rilwan Aikawa held that the application was an abuse of court process as the issue had been dealt with in the no-case application that was dismissed earlier. He noted that there was no proof as to the existence of other statements made by Belgore. The trial could not go on as Abubakar said he needed to change his lawyer. He was previously represented by Chief Tunji Ayanlaja (SAN). In a nine-count amended charge, EFCC said the defendants “directly took possession of N450million,” adding that they “reasonably ought to have known [that the money] formed part of the proceeds of unlawful act.”
