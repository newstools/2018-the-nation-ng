Justice Muslim Hassan of the Federal High Court in Lagos on Thursday ordered the permanent forfeiture of Lekki houses belonging to two naval officers. Captains Olotu Morakinyo and Ebony Aneke were ordered to forfeit the houses to the Federal Government. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleged that the property was acquired illegally. The naval officers were attached to the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) as Guard Commanders. They allegedly acquired a three-bedroom terrace duplex at Lekki Gardens Phase 4, Lekki-Ajah, and a five-bedroom duplex in Lekki with proceeds of fraud. The court also ordered the forfeiture of N11,040,000 found in the bank account of Lakewood Garden Ventures Limited, said to be linked to Aneke and his sister, Jimmie. Morakinyo served as NIMASA Maritime Guard Commander from January to September 2013, while Aneke served in the same capacity from September 2013 to December 2014. Lakewood Garden Ventures is jointly owned by Aneke and his sister. Justice Hassan had on March 28, ordered the interim forfeiture of the property and the money. He directed EFCC to publish the interim order in The Nation Newspaper so that anyone interested in the property could appear to show cause within 14 days why it should not be permanently forfeited to the federal government. Justice Hassan held on Thursday that EFCCâ€™s claim that the properties were proceeds of crime was not controverted.
