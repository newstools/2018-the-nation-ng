The Forum of Niger Delta ex-agitators  is alleging a plot to destabilize the tenure of the Coordinator of the Presidential Amnesty Programme, Professor  Charles Dokubo. Coordinating the alleged plot, according to the group, is a retired military officer. The ex-militants who have been enlisted in the second phase of the Programme have warned the unnamed retired military officer to desist immediately. Spokesman for the forum, Augustine Egba, said in a statement in Abuja that the brain behind the alleged plot has been “concocting falsehood and devising all manner of subterfuge” to see his mission through including using the name of “our beloved NSA, General Babagana Monguno.” He added: “but we have since found out that he does not have the support or any form of backing from the NSA. “The most annoying crime this man is currently committing is his denigration of the Office of the NSA. He is now all over town boasting to all and sundry that the inter-agency team investigating (former Coordinator of the Programme, Brig-General Paul) Boroh (rtd) is in his pocket; that he tells them who to investigate; that if they don’t allow him to return to the Amnesty Office, he will tell them to start investigating persons close to the new Coordinator.”
