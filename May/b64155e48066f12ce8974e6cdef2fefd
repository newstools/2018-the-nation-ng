Scores of All Progressives Congress (APC) members on Monday stormed party secretariat and ‘dissolved’ the state exco led by Chief Jide Awe. They installed a new caretaker exco led by Mr. Kayode Egunjobi. The irate party members locked the secretariat and occupied it for about two hours before policemen came to prevent breakdown of law and order.
