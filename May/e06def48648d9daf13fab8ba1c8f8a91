Kano Pillars forward, Junior Lokosa has set his sights on the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers which resumes in September after failing to make the Super Eagles World Cup team to Russia. The player who was one of the five players dropped by head coach Gernot Rohr has promised to continue to work harder to increase his chances of being considered in the future. “I want to continue working hard so I can get more opportunities with the National team. I know the Africa Cup of Nation is around the corner, so I will have to keep scoring to remain in spotlight. He was particularly grateful to Rohr for the opportunity to feature for the Eagles against Congo DR in Monday’s international friendly which ended 1-1 in Portharcourt. “The Eagles manager has tried and I am grateful for the opportunity he gave me and my other colleagues. I know that the World Cup is a big stage and to get a national shirt is very competitive. But I am grateful for the opportunity,” he said. He described the Eagles manager with a golden heart for the home-based players. Standard Liege midfielder Uche Agbo, Plateau United goalkeeper Dele Ajiboye and Lokomotiv Plovdiv defender Stephen Eze who were also dropped from the 30-man provisional list will also target a place in the team for AFCON. Cameroon will host the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in June after it was shifted from January by the Confederation of Africa Football this year.
