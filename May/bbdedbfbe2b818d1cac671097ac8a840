Kelechi Iheanacho has been recognized for his fine display against Arsenal in a rescheduled Premier League clash at the King Power Stadium on Wednesday evening after he was named in the Team of the Week. Football statistics website Whoscored has selected the best performing players for each position for the six Premier League matches that took place May 8 to 10, and the Nigeria international was picked after scoring against Arsenal. In a 4-4-2 formation, Iheanacho partnered Chile star Alexis Sanchez in attack, teammate and ex-African Player of the Year Riyad Mahrez operated from the right wing with City’s Leroy Sane on the left. The Nigerian had a 8.1 rating, same as Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas, and 0.1 more than his strike partner from Manchester United. Against the Gunners, Iheanacho had a game-high six shots and three were on target, made two successful dribbles, was fouled two times and had a 75 per cent passing accuracy. This season, the Foxes number eight has made 28 appearances in all competitions, tallying seven goals, the same number he registered last year at Manchester City. Next up for Iheanacho and his Leicester City teammates is a trip to Wembley, where they will face Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow at 3pm.
