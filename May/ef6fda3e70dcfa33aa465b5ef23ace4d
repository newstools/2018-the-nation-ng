About six people including four police cadets were yesterday killed in a fatal motor accident on Kano-Kaduna Expressway. Confirming the incident in Zaria, Kaduna State, the Unit Commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Zaria, Mr Muktar Zubairu said the accident involving two vehicles; a J5 bus with registration number: KMC 274 YW and Golf which was burnt to ashes occurred around Kwanar Likoro close to Tashar Yari. According to him, the two vehicles had a head-on-collision and subsequently burst into flames due to presence of a generating machine inside one of the vehicles. He attributed the cause of the accident to ongoing road rehabilitation on Zaria-Kano road that forced motorists to use one lane, thereby leading to series of accidents.
