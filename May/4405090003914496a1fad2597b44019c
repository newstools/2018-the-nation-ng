The General Overseer of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) Worldwide, Dr. Daniel Kolawole Olukoya, has inaugurated a one-storey medical centre built by the Prayer City Tent Makers Group and handed it over to the Mountain Top University (MTU) in Lagos. “I want it (medical centre) to be run excellently and professionally, that is why I handed it over to the Mountain Top University. In future, MTU may have a medical school,” Dr. Olukoya said. The facility, he said, would be of international standard and run professionally. He thanked the Prayer City Tent Makers Group for taking the initiative, noting that the gesture will encourage others to contribute to the development of the Prayer City. The medical centre has a delivery room, children, private, male and female wards, theatres, kitchenette, VIP ward, prayer room, among other sundry spaces. Chairman of Tent Makers Group, Prayer City Region, A.O. Martins, said members were happy to complete the project which is the third of such projects they were doing for the church.
