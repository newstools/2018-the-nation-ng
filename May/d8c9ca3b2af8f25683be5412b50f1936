Regency Alliance Insurance Plc has described 2017 has one with mixed fortune as it posted an increase in the gross premium production from N3.1 01 billion in the 2016 financial year to N3.368 billion in 2017, an increase of 8.61 per cent. The effect of increased premium generation, the company said, was however, significantly eroded by the 117.46 per cent increase in net claims, 18.08 per cent increase in underwriting expenses and 14.63 per cent increase in management expenses when comparing the 2017 figures with that of 2016. Despite the development, the firm declared a dividend payout of N200, 062,500 representing 3k per 50k share for eligible shareholders. Its Chairman, who made this known at the company’s 24th Annual General Meeting in Lagos (AGM), said one salient result of the economic situation has been an increase in both the number of claims and value therein throughout the insurance industry. He noted that in 2017, there were huge claims pay-out in the oil and gas, accident and motor classes insurance. There was an increase of 76.15 per cent in the investment income of the company, which is reflective of the high deposit rates and government yield rates offered during the year coupled with the effect of the increase in prices of equities held by the company which are quoted on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. He added that the resultant effect of this showed a decline of 58.25 per cent in profit after tax from N470.59m in 2016 to N196.48m in 2017. He said: “Though the drop is significant, the company’s fundamentals are still strong. It is expected that the company, building on the gains of past financial discipline and strategic positioning, will produce a better result in 2018. “The total asset base of our company grew by 5.7 from N6.856bn in 2016 to N7 .248bn in 2017. For our group, the contribution of the subsidiaries to the overall profit after tax, after deducting that attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased from N74.041 million in 2016 to N23.369m in 2017. “The total assets for our Group and the company as at December 31, 2017 stood at N9.309 billion and N7.248 billion.
