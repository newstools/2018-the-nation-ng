This seems to be great times for X3M Music artiste, Priaz, as he signs on new artiste under his management. The new artiste, Dapo, a firebrand in the afropop genre, was discovered in the last season of the music reality show, Project Fame, where he served as a judge. Born Oladapo Arogundade, the young artiste has released a single, ‘Vibe’  featuring Monae. His upcoming single, ‘Necessary’, will hit the airwaves soon. According to Praiz, “Dapo is a very talented artiste who I discovered during the last edition of Project Fame where I was a judge. Remember I am a product of reality show as such, I know a good talent when I see one.” Praiz, an award-winning R&B talent, also said he is not leaving X3M Records as his management company is still under X3M. “I am still with X3M music,” he said. “This kind of arrangement is just as Eminem’s Shady Records is under Interscope. This is my label and it’s warehoused under X3M Music. “My boss, Steve Babeko has always wanted me to have my imprint and he’s very eager to see me grow. He supports my dream to grow from being just an artiste to being a businessman. I am blessed to have someone like that who wants to see you grow regardless.”
