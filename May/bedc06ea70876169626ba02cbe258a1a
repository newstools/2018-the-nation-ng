 British pop star Dua Lipa  says her fans and sports lovers alike are in for a super bash at this year’s UEFA Champions league final billed for the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in Kiev. Dua Lipa who received five nominations at the Brit Awards early this year has been contacted to perform at the Champions league final where Real Madrid seeking three straight back to back Champions league victory, take on Liverpool in the May 26 showdown. Dua Lipa who will make an appearance, performing songs from her self-titled album, including IDGAF and New Rules, described her choice for the event as a huge honour which she hopes to put to good use by giving her fans and soccer fans who will storm the venue a lot to cheer about in what could pass for a marriage of sports and good music. “I was honoured to be asked by UEFA and Pepsi to perform at the UEFA Champions League final opening ceremony it’s a once in a lifetime opportunity,” she said in a statement. “I can’t wait to get in front of the fans and be part of such an exciting event. I’m planning to put on an unforgettable show.” The Black Eyed Peas performed at the opening ceremony of last year’s UEFA Champions League final in Cardiff The final, which is the most-watched annual sporting event in the world, was aired in more than 220 markets.
