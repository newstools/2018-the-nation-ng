The Plateau Chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has called for the “immediate release” of former Plateau governor Jonah Jang from Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) custody. Jang, who represents Plateau North in the senate, was invited by the EFCC on Monday over alleged misappropriation of some monies when he governed the north-central state between 2007 and 2015. The senator had, since then, been in the custody of the anti-graft agency. Chief Damishi Sango, the PDP Chairman in Plateau, who addressed a press conference on Jang’s detention, described it as “unconstitutional”. Sango argued that the refusal of the commission to grant bail to the elder statesman was “a gross violation of his fundamental human rights”. “We consider the continued detention of Sen. Jang by the EFCC as unconstitutional, unlawful and gross violation of his fundamental human rights. “It is very shocking and unbelievable that a sitting senator and elder statesman is being denied bail, access to his lawyers, family and even his medication. This is quite unfortunate “We have appealed to party supporters and family members to remain calm and shall continue to ensure that they remain so, but we want the EFCC to, as a matter of urgency, release Sen Jang,” Sango stated. The chairman alleged that Jang’s continued detention was “part of an orchestrated plan to clamp down on the opposition”, saying that Jang was entitled to bail on self recognition since he was a serving senator. “Jang is a former governor and a serving senator; there is no way he will jump bail,” he said. Sango, however, said that the PDP would continue to serve as a viable opposition and ensure a voice for the voiceless “no matter what happens”.
