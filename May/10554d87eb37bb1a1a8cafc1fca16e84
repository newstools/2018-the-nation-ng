The Managing Director, Niger Delta Power Holding Company (NDPHC), Mr Chinedu Ugbo, yesterday, said Ikeja Electric (IE) would be evacuating a total of 16 megawatts (Mw) of electricity from the newly inaugurated injection sub-stations in Alimosho Local Government area of Lagos State. He said the injection sub-stations are located in Amikanle and Abule Taylor area of Alimosho, and were built by NPDHC, in order to improve economic activities in the area. While Amikanle injection sub-station provides 12Mw of electricity, Abule Taylor injection sub-station boasts of 4.5Mw of electricity. Ugbo said the projects are part of the mandates given to the National Independent Power Projects (NIPPs) by the Federal Government to boost electricity supply in the country by 5,000Mw adding that NIPPs, now known as NHPDC is working hard to fulfil its mandates. He said the 1×15 MVA  33/11 KVA Amikanle injection sub-station takes supply from Ayobo through a dedicated  22.5 kilometres 33kva that was constructed by NIPP, with a view to serving the residents of the area, while the Abule Taylor injection sub-station has feeders that are enough to supply power to the residents of the area. He said many power sub-stations have been built by the NDPHC in order to improve supply to both the formal and informal sector of the economy, adding that efforts are on-going to provide more of such facilities in the country. Also, the Chief Technical Officer, IE, Mr Sunday Oyewale, said the capacity of the firm to improve supply of power has increased in recent times. ‘’With the additional two injection sub-stations and several others in areas under the jurisdiction of IE, the sky is the limit in meeting the energy needs of the people,’’ he said.
