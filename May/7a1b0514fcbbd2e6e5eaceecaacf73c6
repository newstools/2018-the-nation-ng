 There is no doubt that today UEFA Champions league is a serious business.  Neither Real Madrid gunning for their third back to back title nor Liverpool hoping to re-enact their winning ways and stop Real Madrid’s cruise control are taking it lightly.  You might consider it funny but it is certainly not funny.  During training ahead of the showdown Real Madrid forward and Portugal international Cristiano Ronaldo fired a shot which landed on the face of a cameraman giving him a cut on the face that had to be stitched. It was not an intentional shot aimed at the cameraman but a shot that probably went slightly away from target. Ronaldo immediately apologised  and handed the cameraman his jacket to seal the apology if you like and say ‘Hope we remain friends. However the shot even if off target is a warning shot, an indication that there will be fireworks today.  The fireworks will not come only from Real Madrid but also from Liverpool who will be hoping that Mohammed Salah maintains his goal harvest. For lovers of the game it will be battle royal today and it is fair to say there will be no dull moment. When two elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers. In this case, it is the pitch of the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium, Kiev that will be literally ‘burnt’ for 90 or more minutes.  If training ahead of the final witnessed breath-taking shots and moves then you can only imagine what the real thing will be.  It might be better to avoid blinking!
