Comedian Atunyota Alleluya Akpobome, who is more popularly known as Ali Baba has said people should give him accolades as he has paid his dues. Dismissing the issue of some people saying he does not have an idea what they are passing through, he wrote. “These days, no one wants to know I was thrown out of 1004, just after Network News and went from there to live at the bar beach for nearly a year. Or squatted in #YabaTech for 1 semester. Or with Uncle Philip Efoguah, for nearly 2 Christmases. “And trekked from NTA Ahmadu Bello Way to Palmgrove depending… Or squatted with the present DG of SON. Osita, for nearly a year. Or with Abigail and Dr Pama in Ketu for some time. Or that I came to Lagos in 1990 with just a suitcase of books and 2 pairs of jeans and 2 brogues. With 2 shirts, 3 polo tshirts and 2 coats. Or that the only hope to survival then was God and @giantajaloko… Naaaaa… all people see now is Ali Baba is flaunting. Na your flaunting? Did you also say “chai Ali Baba has suffered” noooooo. Because the story you know is the good times one. So you think that’s all it is. On his meal method back then, “I laugh when some people come on my timeline and say, I talk because I don’t know what people are going through. You see that 0-1-0 code, or 0-0-1, or 0-0-0, 0-0-1, 0-0-0, 1-0-0… was a routine. Meanwhile it was not Ramadan. Let’s not compare notes. I’m a Notary Public when it comes to hard knocks. So when you see me now… give me some accolades”. After acquiring a degree from the then Bendel State University, Ekpoma in 1990, Ali Baba relocated to Lagos having discovered his comic talent in his third year in university. He had planned to return to Ekpoma to read Law but that was not to be, since he discovered he could make more money from making people laugh than defending them.
