A Fulani socio-cultural organisation, Gan Allah Fulani Development Association of Nigeria (GAFDAN), has volunteered to midwife a peaceful resolution of herdsmen/farmers crises. A statement yesterday by the National President, Sale Bayeri, after its meeting in Jos, decried increasing attacks and deaths in Benue, Nasarawa, Taraba and Kogi States. The statement reads: “GAFDAN is disturbed and devastated by the ranging war between herdsmen and farmers in Benue State, with the resultant unacceptable loss of life and property which has reduced the state to a theatre of war and misery. “We have resolved to look into the possibility of GAFDAN intervening in the conflicts as a neutral body to resolve the issues amicably. “GAFDAN is worried that the Benue crisis, from our findings, is responsible for the clashes in neighbouring Nasarawa, Taraba and Kogi States due to mass influx of displaced animals and persons from Benue State to the neighbouring states. “It is our view that if the conflict is not quelled now, it has the capacity to engulf the entire country and ignite ethno-religious conflicts.” The association added that it has played similar peaceful roles, and has the confidence of herdsmen, farmers and security agencies to intervene as a law abiding group to quell the fire, douse tensions and ensure peace in Benue State and its environs.
