Popular comedienne, Princess, has revealed how her first show, ‘Princess on Stage’, almost failed because the sponsors pulled out two days before the show. Revealing the details in an Instagram video, she wrote; “Tears of joy, I am grateful to be here after all the disappointments. May 2nd (2 days to my #May42018 show) I got the shocker of my life when Eunice who offered to sponsor my show pulled out after almost two months of planning. “Just before I went on stage I was threatened again by her people but God held me. To my family, friends, fans, no matter what you are going through God who brought down pharaoh and the walls of Jericho will not leave you. My birthday wish is that you all get 7 folds of what you wish me. Love you all.” She also used the opportunity to appreciate the people behind the success of the show. “Thanks to you all for supporting me in setting this record “First female stand-up comedian in Nigeria and Africa to perform straight for more than 2 hours,” she wrote. Her colleague, AY also sent his best wishes on his Instagram to the comedienne. “Many comedians have the ability to go gaga on stage… but @princesscomedian is blessed with the natural ability to create a professional atmosphere of madness in seconds. I was so happy to witness how she killed the audience with quality laughter for over 2 hours at her Eko Hotel show. Happy birthday to such fantastic co-worker,” he said.
