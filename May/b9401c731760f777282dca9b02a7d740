 All work and no play it is often said makes Jack a dull boy. That appears to be the case with Real Madrid star Marco Asensio.  The Spain international has became the subject of rumour mills shortly after the Champions league which Real Madrid clinched at the expense of Liverpool in Kiev, their 13th Champions league title and three consecutive win in recent times. The former Malloca ace was rumoured to have spent time with Singer Dua Lipa who entertained in the opening ceremony. As  noted by AS and Mundo Deportivo, rumours emanating from CNN Turkey of Asensio and Dua Lipa spending time together after the game have surfaced and are rapidly spreading. The UK singer was in Kiev to perform the opening ceremony ahead of the game with her latest song, ‘One Kiss’, going down a treat with the travelling fans. These links with Asensio are starting to make headlines and take up plenty of tweet space with rumours suggesting that the two may have crossed paths after the game. Neither have dropped any hints in their own recent social media activity, but it remains to be seen if any budding romance comes from these reports. Dua Lipa who is followed by 2.14million fans on twitter has not dished out any tweets since performing in Kiev.  Her last sport so far was one announcing the release of her new album ONE KiSS, expressing hope that her teeming fans find it one to keep them dancing ONE KISS w/ @CalvinHarris is out!! I hope this makes you wanna dance till your hearts content xxx,” she had twitted April 5.  Ascentio on the other hand is still busy celebrating Madrid’s back to back to back victory in the Champions league. His only tweet so far was dished out shortly after the victory saying (Día espectacular! Gracias a todos por el apoyo. #MA20) Spectacular day! Thank you all for your support. # MA20
