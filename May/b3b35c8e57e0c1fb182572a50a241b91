Lagos State has increased the budgetary provision for housing loans from N50 million to N100 million to improve workers’ welfare, Head of Service (HoS) Mrs Folashade Adesoye has said. She spoke yesterday at the on-going briefing by ministries to mark the third anniversary of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. Mrs Adesoye said the Staff Housing Board had so far given out N95,033,564 loans to about 280 public servants. She said: “I am delighted to inform you that the budgetary provision for housing loan has increased from N50 million to N100 million, laying credence to government’s commitment to staff welfare.’’ The HoS there were 40 buses in the fleet of the centralised staff buses, promising that they would soon be increased because of the high number of workers. “However, owing to the increasing number of staff and the opening up of new residential areas, there is a conspicuous deficit in the number of buses. Governor Akinwunmi Ambode has promised to re-fleet the scheme with new buses.
