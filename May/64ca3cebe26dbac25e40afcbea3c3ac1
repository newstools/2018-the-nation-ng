NationSport has gathered that no date is agreed yet for the unification showdown between Deontay Wilder and Anthony Joshua. Wilder on Sunday however confirmed that the bout will happen. The Bronze bomber claimed that he is willing to fight the WBA, IBF, IBO and WBO champion in his home country or in America. Wilder, 32, said the fight will be in September if it’s in the UK and in November if it happens in America. Speaking to Fight Hub TV, the American said: “We’re still in negotiations so I don’t have a time frame on it just yet but I want everyone to know the fight will happen. “If we have it in England it’ll be September – if it’s here in American it’ll be November. But AJ has insisted it will take place in the UK, claiming he wants to avoid the “tricks” of American judges and referees. And the Watford-born bruiser has insisted that he is willing to lose £15m to secure the fight on home soil. The American, who holds the WBC title, went on to question the character of AJ and his team after he claimed that he would take the fight if he was guaranteed $50 million. He added: “If they still serious – we been serious this whole way through, Joshua said he wanted the $50m he’ll sign tomorrow. “We did exactly what he did and he didn’t sign so that shows you his character already or his team character.
