The Amosun Solidarity Forum (ASF), a support group for Governor Ibikunle Amosun of Ogun state, has debunked media reports that the Governor had endorsed his Chief of Staff, Tolu Odebiyi and Hon Adekunle Akinlade, a member of the House of Representatives, as the governorship candidates of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) for the forthcoming 2019 gubernatorial election in the state. The group said Senator Amosun, as a fair political father of all the aspirants, has constantly insisted that he is yet to anoint any one of them. Speaking to reporters in Abeokuta on Saturday, Gafar Ibitoye Somoye and Dotun Abimbolu, chairman and secretary of the forum respectively, said it is not in the interest of the party for any aspirant or supporters, to be dropping the name of the Governor at a time like this. “Governor Amosun is not an author of confusion. He is a very smart and strategic politician who knows when and how to deal political strokes. He has every right to support any aspirant of his choice and play significant role in how his successor will emerge, but we want to tell you that he is yet to endorse any of the aspirant as we speak today. As loyal APC members and die-hard supporters of the Governor, we warn that nobody should drop his name at this crucial time. “The Governor will not do anything that is capable of truncating the peace currently being enjoyed in Ogun APC. Dropping his name that he has endorsed two aspirants for the same position is not good for the party. So, we urge all loyal party members, be you aspirant or supporter of an aspirant, to avoid political games that can boomerang later. We are ready to wait patiently for Senator Amosun to make up his mind and inform the party of his preference. Wherever he goes, we will go,” he said.
