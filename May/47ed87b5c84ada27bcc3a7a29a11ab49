Enugu State Police Command yesterday denied report of an alleged bomb explosion at an Enugu church on Sunday. Spokesman Ebere Amaraizu said there was no bomb blast in any church as being speculated by a local tabloid. He said: “The command wishes to make it clear to the public that there was no bomb explosion at Holy Cross Catholic Parish, Iji Nike, Abakpa, Enugu State, as being speculated. “The command advises people to go about their activities, as analysis from men of the EOD of the command showed that the incident had got nothing to do with improvised explosive device or the like. “It is pyrotechnic, which the perpetrator used to cause panic among church members. “There was no loss of life, injury or damage to property during the incident.’’ Amaraizu said operatives at the EOD department have secured the area. “Investigation has begun into the alleged incident,’’ he said.
