The Federal High Court in Lagos will on June 19 hear an application for a no-case submission filed by a former Senior Special Assistant to ex-President Gooluck Jonathan on Domestic Affairs, Dr Waripamo-Owei Dudafa. EFCC arraigned Dudafa and Iwejuo Joseph Nna before Justice Mohammed Idris on 23-counts of conspiracy to conceal proceeds of crime amounting to over N1.6billion on June 11, 2013. The prosecution closed its case on March 16, but the defendants opted to make a no-case submission. Dudafa’s counsel Gboyega Oyewole (SAN) served EFCC with his application on April 13, but the commission failed to respond on time. EFCC’s lawyer Rotimi Oyedepo Wednesday said the prosecution had finally filed its no case submission. He served Oyewole with a copy, but could not serve Nna’s lawyer Mr Ige Asemudara who was absent. Justice Idris adjourned for hearing by which time the defence counsel are expected to have filed their replies on points of law. A no-case submission is made by a defendant who seeks acquittal without having to present a defence. The defendants allegedly concealed N1.6billion through a company, Seagate Property Development and Investment Ltd, an  offence contrary to Section 18(a) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) (Amendment) Act, 2012 and punishable  under Section 17(a). They were also accused of knowingly concealing proceeds of crime through Avalon Global Property Development Company Ltd in the sum of N 399, 470,000.00, among others. EFCC said Dudafa “procured” Nna and Ebiwise Resources to conceal N150million being proceeds of crime. Other companies allegedly used in laundering the money include Pluto Property And Investment Company Ltd, Rotato Inter Link Services Ltd and De Jakes Fast Food and Restaurant Nigerian Ltd. EFCC said Dudafa failed to furnish any information in relation to N616, 526,506.70 allegedly held on his behalf by Seagate Property’s account: 7400046952 domiciled in Heritage Bank Ltd as required in page 20 of the Declaration of Assets Form. The prosecution said he also failed to disclose N305, 176,922.99 allegedly held on his behalf by Ebiwise Resource in a Heritage Bank account 1907938635; N64, 319,555.66 held on his behalf by Avalon Global in a Heritage Bank account 6001984078; N560, 000,000.00 held for him by De Jakes Fast Food in Guaranty Trust Bank account 0042308722, and N10, 253,246.85 held for him by Ibejige Services Ltd in an account numbered 6001983026 domiciled in Heritage Bank. The defendants pleaded not guilty and were granted bail.
