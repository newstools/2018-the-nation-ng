The Deji and paramount ruler of Akure Kingdom in Ondo State, Oba Aladetoyinbo Ogunlade Aladelusi, Odundun II, and former Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Chief Olu Falae, have urged the Federal Government to include Akure in the proposed railway route that is expected to pass through the Southwest. The monarch spoke at the weekend while inaugurating this year’s Odun Ulefunta/Oyemekun Committee at his palace. The advertised route of the railway is said to pass through Calabar-Uyo-Aba-Port Harcourt-Yenagoa-Otuoke-Ughelli-Warri-Sapele-Agbor-Asaba-Onitsha-Benin-Ore-Ijebu-Ode-Sagamu- Lagos. Oba Aladetoyinbo said: “As we speak, Akure remains a vital link between the North and the South. It is strategic to the proposed bitumen exploration and the seaport in the riverine area of the state.” Falae hailed the monarch for his love for the progress and development of Akure. The former SGF expressed happiness at the new crop of Akure sons and daughters who had shown interest in the development of the land.
