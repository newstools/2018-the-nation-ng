He has been able to listen to the yearning of his people.” Taiwo reiterated that Ambode has done a good job, noting that he is a governor without border. He has served with so much passion and his ingenuity for excellence is what we admire. Fatai Olapade said the Ambode has provided massive infrastructure project in three years.
