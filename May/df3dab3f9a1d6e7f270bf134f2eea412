The Presidency on Thursday gave reasons why President Muhammadu Buhari stopped over in London after his official visit to the United States. According to a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, said that there is a limit to the distance the President’s smaller plane can cover. He explained that the Presidents big jet has gone for repairs. He said “The big jet is under repair. It has been taken for major repairs. So the President is using a small plane and there is a limit to the distance the small plane can cover. “So the technical stopover I talked about is that the journey from US to Abuja is broken into two. “Technical stopover is that the plane stops at a point, refuel, do some checks and then proceed on the journey. “This is very normal. There is nothing unusual about it. In any case, they are already on their way back home. “It is a routine thing. The plane can do Abuja-Washington, that’s about 12 hours and the maximum the plane can fly is 12 hours, 40 minutes. But you don’t need to push it to the edge.” he said
