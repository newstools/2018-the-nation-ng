 It was weeping and gnashing of teeth for most Stoke fans on Saturday as the club sank in the relegation waters after a 2-1 defeat by Crystal Palace.  The club is returning to the lower division after 10 years in the top flight following a return to the elite division in the 2007/8 season.  Xherdan Shaqiri put the Potters ahead with a brilliant free-kick in the 43rd minute but James McArthur leveled for Palace after half-time. Patrick van Aanholt then capitalised on a defensive error to score a late winner to end Stoke’s 10-year stay in the top-flight. Palace themselves are guaranteed to stay in the Premier League thanks to the result, while Stoke will look back with plenty of regret on the points they have dropped in the last month as, for the third time in four games, they failed to hold onto the lead. In total, they have now lost 18 points from winning positions this season while Paul Lambert has managed just one victory since he was appointed manager in January. Stoke had not finished below 14th in their previous nine Premier League seasons, but they could not get the victory they needed against a Palace side who have been revitalised under Roy Hodgson. Victory would have seen Stoke survive in the Premier League for at least another day, but Palace dominated possession after the break and saw their pressure pay off in the 68th minute when McArthur slid past Jack Butland. This is Stoke’s first relegation from any division since the 1997-98 campaign, when they were relegated from the second tier alongside Reading and Manchester City. Crystal Palace are mathematically safe from relegation, and are therefore the first top-flight team since Liverpool in the 1899-1900 season to avoid relegation despite losing their first seven matches of the season. Stoke finish their season with a trip to Swansea next Sunday while Crystal Palace host West Brom.
