The Borno Chapter of the Nigerian Labour Congress ( NLC ), has urged the State House of Assembly to challenge the state government on workers’ demands. Mr Titus Abana, the NLC State Chairman, made the call at the International Workers Day celebrations held on Tuesday in Maiduguri. Abana said that the labour should not be allowed to shoulder responsibility of championing the course of the workers alone. He lamented that the labour had been putting up its request to the government every year without any meaningful positive outcome. “There is no gain in repeating the dictum that whatever affects the nose should be of interest to the eyes. “The workers are also part of the electorate; their welfare should therefore be of concern to you. “The legislators must work towards guaranteeing that the right of the citizens for a better living is protected. “The government has enjoyed tremendous goodwill from workers translating into the successes recorded in the state. “We therefore call on the government to appreciate and reciprocate this gesture by putting smiles on faces of workers by addressing all their demands,’’ he said.
