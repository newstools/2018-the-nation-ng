Some residents of Ori-Oke Alala in Makoko, Yaba, Lagos Mainland, yesterday stormed the state secretariat at Ikeja, over the May 10 invasion of their community by the police and task force on land grabbers. The protesters demanded that all those involved in the invasion in which four persons died be brought to justice. They carried placards, with inscriptions deploring the invasion. Led by the General Secretary, Ilaje National Alliance Movement, Comrade Alex Omotehinse, the protesters urged Governor Akinwunmi Ambode to set up an independent commission of inquiry to investigate the incident. Omotehinse said the protest became necessary because the right of those attacked was violated. He claimed that since the incident, government had not reached out to the community. Omotehinse said 11 residents were still in hospital because of injuries sustained in the attack. He said those arrested were paraded as criminals, wondering what crime they committed since they have gone to court over the land in dispute. Special Adviser to the governor on Civic Engagement Benjamin Olabinjo said action had been taken on the matter. According to him, the governor had since set up a committee to look into the case. He asked them to be patient because the committee would soon reach out to them
