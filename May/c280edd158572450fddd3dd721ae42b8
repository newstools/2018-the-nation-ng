 International volleyball referee, Sheba Jefferson says lack of regular national and international volleyball competitions are part of the reasons Nigeria does not have more officials during continental competitions. Jefferson, who made the submission in a chat with NationSport during the finals of the CAVB Zone 3 Africa Volleyball Inter-Club Championship at the Volleyball Court of the Teslim Balogun Stadium in Lagos, said Nigeria referees will be more exposed when they officiate regularly. “Our referees have not been given opportunities on the continent because of lack of championships. In volleyball, once your teams are going out, you must have accompanying referees, but if the teams are not going for international competitions, there is no how a referee can travel out. So we need more national and international competitions to expose our referees,” said Jefferson, who is the only female out of the five Nigeria referees recognized by Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB). Nigeria Customs female Volleyball team and the Ghana Police male volleyball team emerged winners in the finals of both male and female categories. “The competition is a welcome development because it has taken a long time that the zone three has hosted such event. So with this competition, the referees, players and the coaches were busy. The competition is on high level because I saw some talented players coming up, even some of the old players were exceptional. “The officiating in of standard because the three of us here just came back from the 2018 Refereeing Seminar in Cairo, Egypt and we have been enriched with new modified rules of the game and this is an opportunity to apply what we’ve learnt,” Jefferson, who is also, a member of the Nigeria Army told NationSport.
