Fairly Used Clothes a.k.a Òkrika traders Association, in Mararaba, a commercial hub along Abuja-Keffi road, have expressed worries over the quit notice issued by the Nasarawa State Government. Mr Stanley Buba, Chairman of the Task Force on relocation, issued the notification on April 30 in Karu, during a meeting with officials of the Traders and Marketers Association and the National Union of Road Transport Workers. Mr Suleiman Hassan, Chairman of the Association, told the News men on Monday that the state government through a special task force had directed that they vacate the area before May 15. He added that the directive was hinged on government’s efforts to free the road of the usual traffic gridlock on that axis, partly caused by trading activities along the busy road. He, however, noted that many of the traders, who sell their wares along the road-side market, were not happy with the directive, alleging that it was sudden and without a proper alternative. “They have asked us to relocate to the newly commissioned Muhammdu Buhari International Market, Karu, Nasarawa; but the areas assigned to us is not properly developed the way it ought to be for convenient trading. “The allocated place is an opened ground without structures, no shops or packing stores where we can keep our goods and will not be accessible by customers, meaning we cannot make sales there. “The raining season is here, and when it starts raining we do not have a place to take refuge and keep our goods for safety since they are clothing,”he said. Hassan appealed to the state government to extend the ultimatum to allow relevant authorities in charge of the management of the new market to make it suitable for the traders. The affected traders are to be relocated to the Muhammadu Buhari International Market, Karu. NAN
