A television cameraman was injured and six vehicles of the Lagos State Building Control Agency (LABSCA) were vandalised yesterday by a mob in Mushin, Lagos. The mob attacked LABSCA officials during the demolition of a two-storey building under construction at 77, Ogunmokun Street, Mushin. Among the damaged vehicles were Hilux pickup vans and Hiace buses. The cameraman works with Lagos Television (LTV). The mob blocked the LABSCA convoy with a Toyota Camry to prevent the team from leaving. The team, accompanied by some policemen, stood its ground and continued with the exercise. The policemen saved the situation without firing a shot or teargas. According to LABSCA officials, the building had no approval, while the owner/developer disobeyed several contravention notices and stop work order served on him. On Agege Motor road, three buildings were sealed off and toked for contravention and no approval. At one of the buildings, residents hailed the LASBCA team for the exercise. One of them told The Nation that the building had defect right from its foundation. “My shop is beside this building. I noticed that the following day after the foundation was laid, cracks emerged on it; even the beams at the back of the building are not strong, so we are happy with the demolition,” he said. On Isolo road, four buildings were also sealed off and also toked for the same offence. Over 15 buildings were affected in the exercise. LASBCA General Manager Olalekan Shodeinde said the government was determined to rid the state of illegal development and stem the tide of collapsed buildings. “Before now, we have been civil in our enforcement, but the developers have remained recalcitrant by continuing in their illegal development. Most of these developers don’t have submission of papers for approval talk less of having permits,” he said.
