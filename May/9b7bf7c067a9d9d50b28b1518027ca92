 Super Eagles players must avoid selfish play if they are to have a smooth sail at the World in Russia.  Former Falcons player Chizoba  Ogbuefi who made the submission, noted that experience has shown that team work is more productive than individual display aimed at earning personal as opposed to team glory. The former sunshine Queens, Ebonyi Angels and Bayelsa Queens ace predicted that Eagles’ opponents; Croatia, Iceland and Argentina will not be cheap adding however that with team work and determination the team will advance from the group. “Eagles must play as a team, there should be no room for selfish play .They just have to be businesslike from the kick off in all their matches. There is no second chance in the world cup, one missed chance can take you to the exit door, so I pray for the Eagles to fly but they must do the needful, play as a team,” she said Chizoba who bared her mind in an exclusive chat with Sportinglife, regretted that Female football in the country is yet to receive the kind of support it deserves, insisting that proper support for female football is one sure way of giving the girl child a better life. “Female football has not received the kind of support it deserves despite our exploits in the continent and beyond and that is rather unfortunate. Female footballers suffer a lot. Some play for clubs that will never pay, some as a result of hardship take to begging while some others are compelled to go into other ugly vices including prostitution. With the level we have managed to reach in the continent at the global level it shouldn’t be so,” she said On the provisional squad released ahead of the world cup, Chizoba who has since become a reputable aerobics instructor since quitting football, said the coach did well in recognising those who contributed to the qualification adding “It is now left for the players to prove themselves in the course of the friendly matches against Congo, England and Czech Republic”
