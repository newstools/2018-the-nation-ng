In continuation of the political peace move by North and South Korea, another significant milestone was achieved at the 2018 ITTF World Team Championships holding in Halmstad, Sweden, as the women teams of North and South Korea agreed to form a team that will battle Japan in the semi-final of the competition. North Korea and South Korea had told the umpires that they would not want to compete on the table against each other when they walked onto the court for their quarter-final match. Instead, both teams requested that they wished to form a unified Korean Team to compete together in the semi-final, which will be held on May 4 against Japan. The decision for the unified team was a tripartite one between the leaders of the North and South Korean Table Tennis teams and the ITTF. ITTF President Thomas WEIKERT who was chairing the ITTF Board of Directors meeting at the time stated: “When I informed the Board of Directors about this development, the unified team received a standing ovation from the delegates who showed their sign of support to this historic move.” The move follows the North and South Korean leaders’ pledge for “lasting peace” to the Korea peninsula just last week, which portrays that table tennis is the perfect medium to promote peace through sport. President of the Table Tennis Association of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea JU Jong Chol stated: “This is the result of the strong support provided by the ITTF and IOC. We will do our best to get more successful results internationally in a joint effort between North and South Korea.”
