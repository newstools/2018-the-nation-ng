The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, said on Tuesday that 35 political parties would participate in the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State. There are 68 registered political parties in the country. Yakubu disclosed this after hosting a delegation of female parliamentarians in West Africa. The delegation was led by Assaita Daffe. The visiting team was at the INEC headquarters to formally present ECOWAS publication on Gender and Election Strategic Framework and Action Plan. While disclosing that the timeline for submission of candidatesâ€™ names has elapsed, Yakubu said there is still room for any of the 35 political parties to substitute candidates if necessary. He had earlier assured the visiting team that the Commission was committed to working with political parties in achieving increased women representation in politics.
