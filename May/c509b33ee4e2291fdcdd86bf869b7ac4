Before he left, Orbih expressed satisfaction with plans towards hosting the Africa Senior Badminton Championship. He said full details would be released after the Ministry of Youths and Sports has been fully briefed. “In Thailand I will be defending the country’s bid to host the African senior Badminton championship which is a big step for the current board towards the development of the sport and also engaging our players. This will also give us the opportunity of exposing more badminton players in the country, especially those who have never played in such a tournament if we get the nod to host.” Orbih who hailed the BFN board for their role in the National championships last year revealed plans to also hold talks with the Chinese Badminton Association to assist the country in the development of the game. Orbih who assured Nigerians especially badminton players when he assumed office of tournaments stated that negotiations are already ongoing with the Chinese Badminton Association to assist in the area of equipment and Technical aspect of the game.
