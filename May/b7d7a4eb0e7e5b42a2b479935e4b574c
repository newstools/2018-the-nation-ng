The International Day of Football and Friendship has been celebrated in over 200 cities of the world, with special events to promote friendship, mutual respect and healthy living. Ayomide Ayanbunmi a young footballer who is aspiring to be a great player, and Hussain Dikko a young journalist who already blogger and joins in the act of commentary at local football centres, especially in the northern part of the country, will be representing Nigeria in Moscow during the Football for Friendship program as well as during the FIFA World Cup. Blessed with soccer talents who have left their imprints on the Nigerian football stage, like Jay Jay Okocha, Kanu Nwankwo, Sunday Oliseh and recently Mikel John Obi amongst others, it goes without saying that her Sporting Media is also very active covering the game both home and abroad. The followership of the round leather game in Nigeria is second to none. These two young lads who were carefully selected, will live with this experience forever and also inspire fellow young people when they return from Moscow with the vast knowledge they will garner at the Football for Friendship program and the FIFA World Cup. Thousands of children and adults are participating in friendly matches, open training sessions, flash mobs and sporting events. On this day, everyone who shares such critical human values as equality, respect for different cultures and peaceful co-existence ties a blue-and-green friendship bracelet on his or her wrist as a symbol of the Gazprom’s International Children’s social Programme Football for Friendship. The blue thread stands for a peaceful sky, and the green one is a football field open to everyone. The participants had received support from famous footballers, coaches, television hosts, actors and members of government agencies all over the world.
