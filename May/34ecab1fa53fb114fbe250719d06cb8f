Injured Super Eagles forward Moses Simeon will on Thursday know if he will be heading for Russia after another a final scan will be carried out on him in London. Simeon who traveled with the team to London this afternoon will be subjected to further medical examination on his injured thigh as a follow-up to the one he had in Port Harcourt and Abuja. “He will undergo a third scan in London. He did one in Port Harcourt and Abuja with the same result,” a source close to the Eagles told NationSport on Wednesday. The scan report would determine whether head coach Gernot Rohr would include the KAA Gent of Belgium player on his final list that will be announced after Nigeria’s friendly against England on June 2. Rohr had initially ruled the player out of the World Cup, but must have been persuaded to seek a second opinion before taking a final decision. The 22-year forward sustained the injury while in the Eagles training camp in Uyo.
