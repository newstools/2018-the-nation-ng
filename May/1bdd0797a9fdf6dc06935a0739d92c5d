Hyundai Motor Company, South Korea’s largest automaker has announced its global sales results for last month, posting a total of 391,197 units sold, up by 11.1 percent from a year earlier. The highest growth since December 2014 was led by strong sales of new SUV models – the all-new Santa Fe and Kona – while a recent sales rebound in the Chinese market also largely contributed to the growth. Sales in overseas markets totalled 327,409 units, representing an increase of 12.2 percent year-over-year. Sales increased significantly as the company’s popular subcompact SUV Kona expanded to key markets and demand remained strong in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia and India. Sales in the Korean market increased by 5.7 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, recording 63,788 units sold.
