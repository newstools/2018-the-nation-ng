A group of placard carrying youths on Tuesday besiege the national secretariat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to protest against Imo state governor, Owelle Rochas Okorocha, demanding an end to his style of governance in the state. The youths wants the party to stop governor from actualising his plans to install his in-law as his successor in the Imo government house , vowing to resist the move. The agitation is taking place as the APC National working committee was expecting a delegation from Imo state led by the governor. Some of the placards read : no more Rochas , After Rochas, No Rochas In-law, we are tired of Rochas Okorocha, Stop Embezzling our Money, Rochas, and many others.
