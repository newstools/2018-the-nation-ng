The Kano State House of Assembly was on Monday sealed off by police following moves to impeach the Speaker of the House, Abdullahi Yusuf Ata, by some lawmakers. However, sources close to the House, told our correspondent that as at Sunday’s night, 21 lawmakers have indicated their support for the speaker’s impeachment. It was gathered that principal officers of the House had been impeached after 21 lawmakers voted for their impeachment. The source said: “The principal officers have already been impeached following the approval by 21 lawmakers who signed the dotted lines. All what we need now is only six members to meet the requirement of 2/3 majority to impeach the speaker without delay. “The reasons behind the reason to impeach the speaker are many but the major one is incompetency. The speaker has virtually localised the House. “We cannot sit until after 2:00 p.m. and even at that things are not moving as expected. We cannot just continue like that because we are representing our constituencies.” However, the speaker has said he would accept his impeachment in good faith. Ata told journalists the attempt by some members of the House to impeach him has nothing to do with competence as alleged. He said: “In anything there is starting and ending point. If Allah Has designed it that my time is off, nobody will extend it by a second. And if it is not time, nobody can remove me from office. That is my belief.”
