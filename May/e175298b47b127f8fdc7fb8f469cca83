 The Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi has tasked traditional rulers across Nigeria with the responsibility to set things right. The Ooni stated this yesterday when he paid visit to the Olu of Warri, His Majesty, Ogiame Ikenwoli, at his palace in Warri, Delta state. The custodian of Oduduwa Dynasty, while emphasizing the need for Nigeria as a nation, to look to its origin and tradition in order to thrive, called on his counterparts to reach out to government in one voice to tackle challenges facing the nation. “It is time for us to rise. As monarchs, it is our responsibility to make things right in this country. It is our responsibility to make sure the youths are well taken care of. Traditional rulers should come together to let our government know that it is about time we get serious in this nation. “The day we decide to put our tradition first, then we start being a serious nation. It is about time for us to uphold our tradition, our heritage and our culture. This is what we have to sell to the world,” Oba Ogunwusi stated. Earlier expressing joy at the visit, the Ogiame Ikenwoli prayed that the peace that had come with the Ooni’s stepping into his palace, will spread around and go with him.
