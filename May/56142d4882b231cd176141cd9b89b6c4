 Wayne Rooney is bound for Washington for talks with MLS side DC United and is set for a medical on Thursday. A spokesman for Rooney confirmed that the former England captain is due to travel to the US with his agent, Paul Stretford, for what will be a first proper look at the MLS outfit. Rooney was photographed at an airport in Barbados, where he has been on holiday with his family, boarding a plane for the US. Personal terms have already been agreed, and while Rooney heads to Washington with the permission of Everton the terms of his settlement with the club – when he has a year to run on a £300,000 a week contract that is paid jointly by the Merseysiders and Manchester United – have not yet been finalised. Ultimately the decision still rests with Everton to let Rooney leave with senior figures at the club still divided on the issue. Bill Kenwright, the club chairman, is believed to be in favour of Rooney staying but his influence at a club now owned by Farhad Moshiri is not what it was. Indeed Rooney is aware that other members of the hierarchy see the benefit of losing the 32-year-old off their wage bill this, and that has been enough to persuade him to consider a move to the MLS when the Americans want him to commit to a £12.5m deal that runs until the end of the 2020 season. DC United are based in the American capital city, Washington, DC and were one of the founding members of Major League Soccer back in 1996. The club’s early years were highly successful and they won the MLS Cup – the league’s overall title determined by end-of-season play-offs – in 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2004. In 1997, 1999, 2006 and 2007, they also claimed the Supporters’ Shield, given to the side with the best record in the regular season. They have won the Eastern Conference five times in their history. They are three-time winners of the US Open Cup, a knockout competition, in 1996, 2008 and 2013. They also won the CONCACAF Champions Cup in 1998.
