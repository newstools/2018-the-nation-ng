THE Department of Mass Communication, Crescent University Abeokuta has pioneered the teaching of new courses in Nigeria. The courses are Digital Public Relations and Advertising (MAS 406), Nigeria Today (MAS 311) and Reporting Religion (MAS 313). Head of Department, Dr Kola Adesina said in a release that the courses are in compliance with the 2018 Benchmark Minimum Academic Standards (BMAS) for undergraduate programmes in Nigerian universities. He said since the new media and internet journalism have changed the face of advertising and public relations practice globally, there was need to upgrade the teaching of the two specialisations. He added that while Reporting Religion would teach students about six major religions of the world, Nigeria Today would equip students with a fair overview of their country as well as its natural resources and diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries.  Congratulating the department, the Vice Chancellor, Prof Ibraheem Gbajabiamla said he was happy about the creativity and ingenuity of the faculty members in introducing the contemporary courses which will enhance the productivity of the department’s graduates. “All higher institutions in Nigeria offering degree programmes in Mass Communication are free to decide on the contents, nature and organisation of their courses. Consequently, mass communication degree programmes offered by any institution in Nigeria should have their own particular characteristics,” he said. Gbajabiamila extolled the department for continuously producing alumni of global standard both in employment and further studies, urging them not to relent.
