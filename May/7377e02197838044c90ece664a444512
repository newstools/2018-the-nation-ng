Former Tottenham Hotspur youth-teamer William Troost-Ekong has commented on the upcoming friendly between England and Nigeria at the National Stadium in London on June 2, 2018. The central defender has stated the friendly against the top team will test the national team’s preparation for the World Cup and has a message for the Super Eagles’ supporters based in the United Kingdom. ”I think it is a kind of game that the setting will speak for itself, I think we have to rise to the occasion especially playing at Wembley,” Troost-Ekong told Extra Time Soccer Live. ”I know we have a lot of Nigerian fans in England as well, so I don’t think it is going to be like playing away as much because we are going to have great support. ”It is going to be difficult but the same time it’s going to be the kind of test we want to have before the World Cup. ”I am sure something is going to go wrong in that match as well but it’s nice to test ourselves against a good team and to see where we are regarding the tournament.” Troost-Ekong has been named in the Super Eagles starting line-up for this evening’s international friendly against Democratic Republic of Congo in Port Harcourt.
