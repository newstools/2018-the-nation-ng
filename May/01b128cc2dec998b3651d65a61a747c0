More than six months after President Muhammadu Buhari presented the 2018 expenditure profile for lawmakers’ consideration and passage, the bill was laid at the Senate and the House of Representatives yesterday. The document was presented to a joint sitting by the President on November7, last year with a plea that the lawmakers should expedite action so that the country could return to the traditional January to December budget cycle. On presentation yesterday, the estimate was jacked up by N508 billion to take it to N9,120, 334,988,225 from the N8.6 trillion presented by the President. Following the laying of the report of the Appropriations Committee of the House by its Chairman Mustapha Dawaki yesterday, Deputy Speaker Yussuff Lasun, who presided over plenary, said the report would be considered between today and tomorrow and passed. “Members are advised to pick up copies of the budget report from 8am tomorrow (today), then we converge in the afternoon to consider it and pass it on Thursday,” he said. The document was also laid at the Senate by Appropriations Committee Chairman Danjuma Goje. Senate President Bukola Saraki did not make any remarks on when the report would be adopted.
