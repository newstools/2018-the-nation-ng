Women’s leadership Group (WLG), a civil society organisation, has urged students and youths to promote gender equality. Members of the group, at a conversation with Faculty of Arts students of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), said gender equality would create opportunities for women to participate in politics. Dr Nkechi Eke-Nwankwo, a gender expert, and Rakiya Zubairu, a journalist, challenged the students to go beyond the cynicism about electoral processes and find ways to engage and make a change. The event was organised in collaboration with the Faculty of Arts Students’ Association (FASA). The WLG’s engagement with the youths was part of the organisation’s activities to galvanise youths for electoral participation as generation elections draw close. The group, which engaged 140 students, noted that the gender discussion became imperative to ensure improvement in gender representation in politics. Eke-Nwankwo said the group had been promoting women’s political rights since 1998, based on the belief that women needed to be encouraged to seek political offices rather than waiting on men to reserve certain public offices for them. She said there was no shortage of qualified women to fill political positions. In the interactive session during the engagement, the students pledged to push the conversation and also promised to register to vote.
