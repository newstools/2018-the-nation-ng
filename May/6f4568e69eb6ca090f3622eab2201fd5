The Osun State Internal Revenue Service  on Wednesday  sealed the Administrative Bock of  Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, over a N1.8 billion  tax debt. The newsmen reports that the officials of the service, who came with policemen and NSCDC personnel, put the gates of the block under lock and key after obtaining a court order. The Public Relations Officer of the university, Mr Abiodun Olarewaju, told newsmen that the state government and the university had an agreement which the institution was complying with. Olarewaju said that the university, being a federal institution, was committed to paying up the tax debt owed the state. The spokesman, who  appealed to the state government to give the university a respite, however, said  fresh students  just beginning their week of orientation were not affected as only the Administrative Block was sealed and not their departments. According to Olarewaju, the management of OAU is law abiding and will ensure prompt payment of its tax debt. NAN
