Residents of Oki Street in Iyana-lpaja, Agbado/Oke-Odo Local Council Development Association (LCDA) of Lagos state have complained of what they called crazy bills from Ikeja Electric (IE). They demanded for pre-paid meters to solve the problem. They spoke at the palace of their Baale, High Chief Adedayo Oki, during a stakeholders meeting with some IE officials. Oki noted the frequent disconnection of consumers, saying this has put the community in darkness for sometime. IE Business Manager in Alimosho, Lanre Yussuf, said their complaints would be attended to. He promised that estimated billings would soon stop. Yussuf promised that pre-paid meters would be made available in the community in the next two to three months. He assured the residents that he would be on the field to monitor their complains. He asked the community to nominate two persons to join IE workers to observe the transformer reading at least three times a month. The reading, he said, cannot lie, adding that it would help to ascertain the bills given to them. He implored those complainants to write, noting that genuine complaints are few.
