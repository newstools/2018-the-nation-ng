Osun State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Mr Adelani Bolarinwa has said the state offers one of the best elementary school education in the country. He stated this at the Ife Arts Fresher’s week at the Ajose Lecture Theatre Obafemi Awolowo University Ile Ife with the theme: Why are we in school”? The essence to set our priorities right for a better tomorrow”. “Osun has the most basic elementary school education. We organize training for our staffs, just about four weeks ago we just organised training for principals of each schools. ” As a student you must be an entrepreneur.  You shouldn’t wait for the income you get from education; you must be able to make money yourself.  Education is beyond the four walls of the university. Walk with friends that are of like minds” he added The Commissioner advised students to be of good conduct. “Education is not an end or a means to an end. Education should be free in both primary and secondary school. Getting A’s and first class is beyond the walls of Education but the skills you have achieved is what they call education.” Also speaking at the event, the Staff Adviser of Faculty of Art Student Association(FASA) Dr Saheed Amusa told the freshmen to be  strategic. ” Be creative, acquire new skills like tailoring, hairdressing, barbing amongst others.  Try new things, new books but do not allow yourself to be distracted,” he admonished. The Dean of Faculty Art Professor Gbemisola Adeoti also admonished the new intakes to be focused and should desire to have a good grade. “You start building your career right from your 100 Level days.  Start developing what you want to be in the nearest future. Pay attention to the food you are going to be eating.  Food is more important in your life. Persistence is the key to success,” he added.
