A 44-year-old truck driver, Jimoh Oladipupo, on Thursday appeared before an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’
Court for allegedly causing the death of a 16-year-old girl, Ebun Solomon.
Oladipupo, whose address was not provided, is facing a seven-count charge bordering on reckless driving and manslaughter.
The Prosecutor, Insp. Ajayi Emmanuel, told the court that the accused committed the offences on May 12 at Vono Junction,
along Olateju Road, Mushin, Lagos.
Emmanuel said the accused drove a Mack truck with registration no. KSF 421 SM recklessly and hit a commercial bus with
14 passengers on board.
“Oladipupo hit the bus from behind and immediately it somersaulted, resulting in the death of Ebun Solomon while other 13
passengers were seriously injured,’’ he said.
He said the accused failed to report the accident at the police station and was about to escape when people at the scene
apprehended him.
The offences contravened Sections 18, 19, 7, 23, 40, 45, of Road Traffic Laws of Lagos State, 2015.
The accused, however, pleaded not guilty.
Chief Magistrate Omolade Awope granted the accused bail in the sum of N500, 000 with two sureties in like sum.
Awope said the surety should show evidence of three years tax payment to the Lagos State Government as part of the
bail conditions.
In addition, the sureties must reside within the court’s jurisdiction.
The case was adjourned until June 20 for hearing.
