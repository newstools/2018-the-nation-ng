The Rivers State Commissioner of Police, Zaki Ahmed, on Monday expressed regret that the body of the slain Divisional Police Officer (DPO) in charge of Rumuenimenin Police Station, Kingsley Chukwueggu, has not been found. Chukwueggu, a Superintendent of Police (SP), was murdered in cold blood early last month at the Awaza area of the state, while returning from Imo State. Ahmed said four shallow graves were discovered at the criminals’ hideout but none contained the remains of Chukwueggu. Seven suspected killers of the DPO were paraded at the state police command headquarters in Port Harcourt. They were – Uche Ogbonna (General), Chidiebere Oberenwa (Okotoburu,) Bethel Ihejirika and Solomon Ogbonna. Others were –  Ikenna Onwuchekwa, Nnamdi Ikpe and victor Marcus. Ahmed said: “Four shallow graves were discovered at the robbers’ den but there were  no traces of the DPO or his corpse.”
