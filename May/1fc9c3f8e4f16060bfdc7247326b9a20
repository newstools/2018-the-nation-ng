Super Eagles’ winger, Moses Simon is set to undergo one more final scan in London ahead of Nigeria’s game against England this weekend, with reports suggesting Head Coach Gernot Rohr is willing to wait and see if the player can make a late push for the World Cup in Russia, AOIFootball.com can confirm. Simon was initially ruled out for the tournament by Rohr after the player’s scan results confirmed he would be out for the tournament. However, Moses requested for a further scan in the UK, with Rohr granting him his wish to prove his fitness ahead of the World Cup. The winger scored once and provided two assists for Nigeria as they went unbeaten throughout the qualifying series and will no doubt be a massive miss, should further scan confirm him unfit to play at the Mundial in Russia next month.
