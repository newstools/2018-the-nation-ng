Special sport athletes have teamed up with other people living with disability to stage a walk for Lagos State Governor, Akinwunmi Ambode today. According to the convener, Amuda Azeez Adesoji, a former powerlifter, the walk will commence at Costain and end at the Teslim Balogun Stadium. He stated that about 3000 participants expected at the walk would converge at the starting point early in the morning, while the walk is expected to commence by 9am. Adesoji stated that all the security agencies including the Nigeria Police and Lagos State Transport Management Authority (LASTMA) have been contacted to ensure that the walk is hitch-free. He said the security agencies would also ensure that motorists use other routes during the walk. “We are organising the walk because of the good things the Governor has done for the disabled people in the state. The Special Sports athletes are well taken care off, while others who are living with disabilities are also considered for jobs in government parastatals. This shows that the governor has the love of the disable people at heart,” he added. Adesoji, who was at the stadium yesterday to sensitize the special sports athletes, expressed delight that most of them agreed to join the walk to show appreciation to the governor. “I was so happy that my colleagues bought into the idea and are ready to turn out in large numbers for the walk. It shows that they appreciate what Governor Ambode is doing for us. And I am sure the governor will do more,” Adesoji added. The walk is being put together by Disabled Democrats in conjunction with disabled group in Lagos State.
