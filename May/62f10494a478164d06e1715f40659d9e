The University of Ibadan Alumni Association (UIAA) has said it will inaugurate and hand over a N200-million 54-bedroom postgraduate hostel to the school management. This is part of efforts to ease accommodation problem. The event, slated for Friday, is part of activities to celebrate the association’s 60th anniversary. Speaking yesterday, UIAA’s National President Dr. Kemi Emina said the association had contributed to development and progress of the university. He said although the association might not have achieved 100 per cent of its plans, his predecessors and colleagues have laboured in the last 60 years to contribute to the university’s progress. Emina said those who  contributed to the institution’s progress, would be recognised and appreciated. The national president said the event would attract and sensitise more alumni to support their alma mater. He said Governor Hassan Dankwambo of Gombe State would perform the inauguration, and deliver the 5th National Public Service Lecture/60th Anniversary Lecture. Emina said the fund was sourced from members, adding that donations were made by friends of the institution. He said UIAA would generate N100 million annually to support the management. The national president said  lectures in the last 30 years,  compiled into a book, would be presented at the event. He said the book’s foreword was written by ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo, adding that Dr. Tunji Olaopa will review it. Emina said those to be honoured included the Primate of Anglican Church, Dr. Nicholas Okoh; Registrar of Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) Prof Ishaq Oloyede; Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Rainoil Mr. Gabriel Ogbechie.
