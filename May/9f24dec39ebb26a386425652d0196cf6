President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated former governor of Ekiti State and Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Kayode Fayemi, for winning the All Progressives Congress (APC) ticket to contest the July 14, 2018 governorship elections. In a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and publicity, Garba Shehu, President Buhari commended all the participants in the keenly contested position, who passionately worked hard to serve the state as governors and urged them to keep upholding the values and philosophy of the party by supporting the APC candidate in the forthcoming elections. President Buhari said Fayemiâ€™s track record in the state as a reformist, with a penchant for building educational infrastructure and promoting the welfare of the ordinary people, will bolster his chances at the forthcoming polls. The President noted that the successful primaries in the state, with more than 30 aspirants, further validate the credentials of the APC on internal democracy, and its preparedness to take the country to another level of development.
