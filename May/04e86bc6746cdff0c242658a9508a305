With two goals scored by Gareth Bale Real Madrid has won the UEFA Champions League final defeating Liverpool  3-1 on Saturday night. Karim Benzema was the first to score for Real Madrid after a clanger from Karius after which  Sadio Mane levelled scores. Bale then produced two incredible strikes – the first in particular a brilliant overhead kick – to seal the victory, although Karius should have saved the second.
