Police said on Monday that another suspected member of the armed robbery gang that attacked commercial banks in Offa, Kwara State, last month, has been arrested. Kunle Ogunleye, 35, alias Arrow, was arrested on Monday at Oro Town in Kwara State by operatives of the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) Intelligence Response Team (IRT). Ogunleye’s arrest followed the apprehension of a dismissed police Corporal, Michael Adikwu, two weeks ago. Adikwu’s Close Circuit Television (CCTV) captured image was circulated on social media after the robbery. Police said investigation into the robbery was extended to Ondo, Osun, Oyo and Ekiti States, adding that credible information from the public led to the suspects’ arrests. Adikwu, a native of Apa local government area of Benue State, was dismissed in 2012 for compromise. He was said to have released some notorious armed robbers in custody and prosecuted for the offence. The police said Adikwu spent three years in prison and was released in 2015. “All suspects arrested have confessed to the Offa bank robberies and murders. They are  assisting the IRT teams to arrest more suspects,” police said.
