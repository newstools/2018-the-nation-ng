National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, said yesterday that he has no preferred candidate among the 33 members seeking its ticket for the July election. “I’ve    put my own political gear in neutral. I have no anointed candidate,” Tinubu said in Lagos during the party’s congress. He added: “everyone there aspiring and contesting are very dear members and they deserve the right to participate. About 33 of them in all and we only need one of them for governorship. We have had leadership discussions “I am very happy and proud of our party, All Progressives Congress, the APC. We are demonstrating to the people across the country that we are a law-abiding political party; that we believe in the tenets of democracy and that we demonstrate the openness in the congresses across the country.” Citing Lagos State as an example of how congresses should be conducted ,Tinubu said:”Things are going according to plan, very open and transparent process. “They queue up behind whoever they want, no pre-ordained candidate. The turn-out is very impressive. “The membership of the party is growing in leaps and bounds and open to all democrats who want to identify with us. “This is one of the best ways to energize the party that is almost remaining dormant at the grassroots level and you could see the sense of belonging and the energy and activities of the ordinary people. It is a great joy for me.” He pleaded with party members especially those aggrieved in any way to “write to the party headquarters and just don’t take laws into their hands.” Continuing, he said: “I am proud of what is happening. I am very proud of the leadership. The leaders are for everybody; no bias, and they should move on peacefully and help the country to grow and progress democratically.”
