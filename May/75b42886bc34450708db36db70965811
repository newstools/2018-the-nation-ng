The national leader of APC, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has urged the contestants to support the winner saying, “It is time for us to make history. Let us not squander this fine chance. We win by standing together.” According to him, “The Ekiti primary has now been conducted. From all indications, it was free of disruption and any sign of offense. Here, we all must thank and commend the excellent work and diligence of Governor Al-Makura. He showed commitment to the party and its democratic principles by ensuring that the primary was conducted fairly and openly. He did all he could to ensure an honest process. He has done well for the party and Ekiti. “Now that the primary has been concluded, we must realize that only one person can win. I applaud all the contestants for their passion and effort during the primary. By the very exercise of your democratic rights to contest for the governorship nomination, you have strengthened the party. Now I ask, I beseech all of you to further strengthen the party by respecting the fair results of the primary whatever the result may be. Everyone cannot be satisfied by the outcome but we all must respect the fairness of the process. “This is the manner of democracy. Yesterday was the time to compete against each other. Today is now time to join hands to ensure a unified APC wins the governorship of your state. It is time for us to make history. Let us not squander this fine chance. We win by standing together.”
