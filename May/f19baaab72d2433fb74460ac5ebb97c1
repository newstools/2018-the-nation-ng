Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (TaskForce) will today commence a clampdown on illegal activities of local government traffic officials. Lagos State Task Force Chairman, Olayinka Egbeyemi, in a statement, said the clampdown was the directive of the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, Edgal Imohimi. Egbeyemi said the illegal activities of the notorious traffic officials on Lagos roads has been worrisome as cases of motorists being extorted were reported to his office daily. He said Imohimi was not comfortable with the rate of extortion of motorists by the traffic officials who claim to be enforcing the Lagos State Road Traffic Law of 2012. “As a responsive and responsible government, the right of Lagosians including motorists is paramount to Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. The ban on all local government traffic officials from controlling or engaging in traffic duties by Governor Akinwunmi Ambode still stands.  Traffic management is not a responsibility of the third tier of government. “Indeed there are traffic units in all 20 local governments and 37 local council development areas. CP Edgal Imohimi has therefore said that only Nigeria Police, Federal Road Safety Corps, Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) Taskforce and the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) can perform traffic duties in Lagos State,’’ he said. He urged motorists to always adhere strictly to traffic regulations and report illegal activities of notorious traffic officials to the nearest police station.
