 President Muhammadu Buhari has commiserated with Pastor Tunde Bakare, General Overseer of Latter Rain AssemblyÂ  on the death of his mother, Mrs Abigail Eebudola Bakare. In a telephone call to his friend and one time running mate, President Buhari urged the cleric and the Bakare family to take solace in the fact that the late Mrs Bakare lived long enough to witness the enormous successes achieved by her children. The President, in a statement by the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, called on the bereaved family to uphold the cherished ideals of community service, kindness and generosity associated with the matriarch of the Bakare family, who died on May 5, 2018, aged 108.
