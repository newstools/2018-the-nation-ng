Visionscape Sanitation Solutions (VSS) said Lagosians need not worry over the rising scourge and menace of plastics. The firm said Transfer Loading Stations (TLS) in Agege, Oshodi and Lagos Island are prepared for the task ahead. Its Chief executive officer, John Irvine, said Agege and Lagos Island stations will handle only solid waste; the Oshodi station will cater for solid, medical and hazardous waste. “The Lagos market is highly dependent on plastic materials. Without adequate disposal processes, the waste materials end up polluting the earth, the oceans and ultimately, affecting human health. Improving the process of sorting and packaging at these transfer loading stations makes it easier for us to recover materials that would have caused pollution,” Irvine said. He noted that the benefits of TLS reflect in both economic and environmental terms. Irvine explained that facilitating an efficient approach to waste management in the state is the core of its framework for the new waste management system – the Cleaner Lagos Initiative (CLI).
