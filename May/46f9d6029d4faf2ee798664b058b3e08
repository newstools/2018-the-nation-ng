•As celebrity blogger reveals pregnancy Celebrity blogger, Linda Ikeji seems to be enjoying the cloud surrounding the man in her life. She has made her followers curious over the suspense when, first, she conceded to an engagement rumour in late March, and two days ago, made public her pregnancy in a baby bump photo show with a lengthy online post on her love for kids. Putting paid to the engagement rumour in March, Linda’s younger sister, Sandra had joined other celebrities to congratulate the blogger, lending credence to the news that she was affianced to a man described as a long-lost friend. She said: “Congratulations @officialLindaIkeji So happy for you sweet sis! This tells me that sometimes the wait is worth it. Can’t wait to plan…” A buildup to the blogger’s gradual transition into a family life happened on Sunday in a viral show of her baby bump. “…Imagine that in a few months, I will look down at a baby, and it won’t be a neighbor’s child, a friend’s child, a sister’s child, but my own child, my own flesh and blood, carried in my womb. My own son. It’s surreal. I can’t get over it,” she said in the post. According to Ikeji, “2018 started with me finding out I was pregnant. When I missed my period and my friend and I did a home pregnancy test and it read positive, my friend began to cry with happiness but I was just there staring at the stick like, you’re not messing with me, are you? This is real and not a joke on me, right? I refused to believe it and asked my friend to drive me to a lab for another test. And there it was confirmed, I was pregnant. Me, Linda, I am going to have my own child. Please don’t wake me up from this lovely dream..lol” Ikeji who disclosed she is in her Trimester, announced she will be having a baby shower in a few weeks. There are indications the suspense will linger until a marriage ceremony in a few months, where the man in her life will be unveiled.
