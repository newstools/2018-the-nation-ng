The African Democratic Congress (ADC) in Ekiti State yesterday elected Mr. Ayodele David-Adesua as its governorship candidate for the July 14 election. David-Adesua was affirmed as the flag bearer by delegates at the state congress held in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. The candidate described the ADC as a better alternative to the Peoples, Democratic Party (PDP) government which, he said, has unleashed hunger and poverty on the people. David-Adesua said the party’s popularity has soared since it has been adopted as a political platform by the Coalition of Nigeria Movement (CNM), led by former President Olusegun Obasanjo. He said the door of the party is open to people who desire positive change and development, adding that it will form the next government. He said the party is on a rescue mission to bring Ekiti “out of the woods” and revamp its ailing economy. David-Adesua said the ADC administration, led by the party, would provide economic empowerment, skills acquisition for the youth and women, and creation more jobs. He said Ekiti has large deposits of minerals, which can be exploited to generate more revenue and make the state less dependent on federal allocation. He urged party delegates and members to go back home and sell the manifesto of the party to the people at the grassroots.
