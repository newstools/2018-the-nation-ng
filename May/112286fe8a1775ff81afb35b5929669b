AGGRIEVED pensioners in Edo State and Governor Godwin Obaseki yesterday traded words over payment of pensions and gratuity. But the governor assured the pensioners of better days ahead, promising to keep to his words to start paying them. The pensioners, who wore black to the May Day rally at the Sports Complex of the University of Benin, interrupted Obaseki’s speech as he made effort to explain efforts he had made to settle pension arrears. They became more annoyed when Obaseki told them to stop collecting money from the opposition party to fight his administration. Obaseki informed the pensioners that the opposition party was responsible for their plight because pension and gratuity were not paid as far back as 1997. He said he had instructed the local government councils to pay outstanding pensions and salaries before the end of the year after releasing N1.5 billion from the Paris Club Refund. He noted that by next year, all local government employees would be converted to the contributory pension scheme. According to him, “I am not happy that some people are wearing black. I promise you will not wear black next year. “My predecessor, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole had an option to pay only those that retired in his time but he went back to start paying pension from 1997. I made a promise and I will keep my promise.” Chairman of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) Emmanuel Ademokun urged the governor to employ people into the State Public Service to address depleting workforce.
