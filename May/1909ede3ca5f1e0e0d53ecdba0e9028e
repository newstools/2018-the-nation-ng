Rotary International District 9110, Nigeria has offered scholarship to 25 undergraduates. Its District Governor Dr Wale Ogunbadejo announced this during the presentation held at Rotary Centre in Ikeja GRA, Lagos. Congratulating the winners, Ogunbadejo said they were lucky to have been chosen out of the 160 that applied. He advised them to study hard so that they could continue to enjoy the scholarship worth N100,000 each yearly, warning that any student who failed to get the required cumulative grade point average (CGPA) would lose it. He also advised them to be good ambassadors of Rotary by being of good behaviour, urging them to join Rotaract while in school. District Educational and Welfare Endowment Fund (DEWEF) Chairman Adeniji Raji said Rotary embarked on the awards nine years ago because it wanted to add value to the lives of youth. He listed the beneficiary institutions as University of Lagos (UNILAG), Federal University of Agriculure, Abeokuta, (FUNAAB), Lagos State University (LASU), Tai Solarin College of Education (TASUED), Federal Polytechnic, Ilaro, Lagos Polytechnic, and Federal College of Education, Osiele, with UNILAG topping the list with eight awardees. The undergraduates were picked from Medicine, Primary Education, Microbiology, Christian Religious Knowledge (CRK), and Marketing. Others include Linguistics/Yoruba, computer Science/Mathematics and Physiotherapy. He said, so far, Rotary has 55 students on its scholarship list with a promise to increase the number in future. He charged the students to be role models in their institutions. He announced that from next year, each beneficiary would be assigned to a mentor. He praised past district governors (PDGs) Adekunle Kukoyi for establishing the fund and Prince Adeluyi Adelusi for his contributions to it. A beneficiary Agbaje Ahmed Ayobami of the UNILAGâ€™s College of Medicine said he was excited by the award. He praised Rotary for selecting him and for its humanitarian activities.
