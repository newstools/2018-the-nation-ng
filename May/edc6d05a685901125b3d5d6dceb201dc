Argentina yesterday admitted that beating Nigeria would be the most challenging task for them at the ongoing ITTF World Team Championships holding in Halmstad, Sweden. Speaking on behalf of the South American side, Cifuentes Horacio told NationSport yesterday when they won the first match against Segun Toriola, they thought they could beat the West African team, but with the current form of Aruna Quadri, the victory was beyond their reach. “I have watched Aruna Quadri’s videos, and I realised that his greatest strength was his powerful forehand. So I tried to control it, it was a bit difficult for me. I also wanted to play a rally with him; it was tough because he is excellent in rallying. So I need to play more than 15 rallies if I hope to win a point against Aruna Quadri. Apart from that, he is an experienced player among the top 30 in the world. The Nigerian side is solid. We gave our best, but it was too hard for us to defeat them,” the Spain-based star said. “We have lost against Nigeria, but we are not going to give up on our dream of fighting for promotion. We will take the next matches more seriously and remain focused until we make the top three teams in the group that will advance to the knockout stage.” Cifuentes Horacio added. Argentina occupies the third spot on the group table, and their next group match today is against Turkey.
