The new Woman Leader of the Lagos State Chapter of the All Progressive Congress (APC),  Hon. Jumoke Okoya-Thomas, has promised to protect the interest of women across the state. Speaking to journalists after the swearing-in of the new executive members of the party at its state secretariat on Acme Road, Ikeja, Lagos on Thursday, Okoya-Thomas promised to bring a new lease of life to the women and other members of the party. According to her, “We will bring in a new generation of women in politics into Lagos APC and protect the interest of all the women in our great party especially in the grassroots. I promise to uphold this throughout my stay in office and I have no doubt that other members of the new executive under the pragmatic leadership of the new chairman of our great party would co-operate with me in this task,” she enthused. The former member of the Federal House of Representatives promised to listen to suggestions from women and carry them along in her task of making things better, adding that the APC-led government believes in women empowerment and participation in politics. “My aim is to build on what my predecessors have achieved and make more women to actively engage in the political process of Lagos State by vigorously mobilizing more women into the APC, especially the new generation of politically conscious women.”
