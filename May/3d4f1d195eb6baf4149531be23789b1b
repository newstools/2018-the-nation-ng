Supporters of one-time Governor Lam Adesina have demanded a free and fair congress of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Oyo State. The loyalists, claiming to have been marginalised by Governor Abiola Ajimobi, urged President Muhammadu Buhari and the national leaders of the APC to closely monitor the party’s affairs to avoid a “dismal failure” in the ward, local and state congresses. They met at the weekend under the aegis of APC Unity Forum. Those at the meeting according to a statement by Dr. Wasiu Olatunbosun, its secretary, were governorship aspirants, representative of Minister of Communication Adebayo Shittu, representative of Deputy Governor Moses Alake Adeyemo, two senators, members of the House of Representatives including Dapo Lam-Adesina, among others. Others include 19 members of the House of Assembly, 20 former members of the Assembly, 25 former Caretaker Chairmen, local government chairmen and notable leaders across the 33 local government areas. The communiqué, signed by the Chairman Alhaji Abu Gbadamosi and Olatunbosun, said: “The forthcoming congresses must be transparent, devoid of any imposition and in accordance with the party’s Constitution. Therefore, party members must be allowed to choose their preferred executive members at all wards, local government, state, and national delegates to the national convention of the party. “We are constrained to make this intervention to avert a repeat of the disquiet, disharmony and crisis resulting from the failure to conduct credible primaries for local government elections. “The forum urges the national leadership to beam its special searchlight on Oyo State if it truly cares for free and fair congresses, failure of which we believe will spell doom for the fortune of the party in 2019.” The forum also endorsed President Buhari for a second term with a promise to deliver three million votes.
