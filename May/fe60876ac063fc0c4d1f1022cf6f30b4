A seminar on entrepreneurial skills will hold between May 21 and 25 at the Ember Creek, Lekki, Lagos. The seminar, according to the organiser and facilitator, Mrs Joan Okorodudu, “is to teach aspiring models and practising ones the basics about the industry so they will know what they are getting into.” Mrs Okorodudu, the Managing Director of Isis Models, said: “We want to change the mind-sets of people who are either running the modelling industry or young models who are upcoming or those there already. We want to teach models about contract, certain entrepreneurial skills which will come in handy by the time they retire from modelling or when jobs are scarce.” Some of these skills, she said, include styling, make up, designing, hair styling, photography, acting among others. The seminar, she said, will enable models and designers to showcase their skills. “Basically, we want to teach models how to become entrepreneurs. We want models who can make money from other means. Models need to know what they are getting in the industry. The modelling career is short – between 10 and 15 years. Not everyone can be Naomi Campbell with a long career.
