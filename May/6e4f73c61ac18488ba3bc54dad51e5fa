A non-governmental organisation, (NGO) Jubilee Concept International, will on June 9 hold a free 12-hour gospel concert to mark Governor Akinwunmi Ambode’s third anniversary in office. Tagged Lagos Marathon Praise, the event, scheduled for the All seasons Events Plaza Agidingbi, Ikeja, will feature prominent and upcoming artists in Lagos. The group’s co-coordinator, Adegboyega Taiwo said the concert was the brain child of Ambode’s wife, Bolanle. He said it was meant to bring people together to praise God for good governance and harmony in the state. The peaceful co-existence and harmony among people of different ethnicities, cultures and religions, he said, was a favour from God. “Despite that the state accommodates virtually all the nationalities of the world and representatives of different ethnicities, the state has continued to enjoy relative peace and mutual harmony among its residents, making the business of governance to be impactful and uninterrupted in the last three years of this administration, we give all glory to God,’’ he said.
