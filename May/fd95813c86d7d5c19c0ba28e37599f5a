The Lagos State government yesterday said finished goods valued at over $735.8million (about N264billion) have so far been exported from the Lekki Free Zone (LKF) project in the last three years. Commissioner for Commerce, Industry and Cooperatives, Mrs Olayinka Oladunjoye who spoke at the annual Ministerial Press Briefing to mark the third anniversary of Governor Akinwunmi Ambodeâ€™s administration at the Bagauda Kaltho Press Centre, Alausa, said the government was totally committed to the development of businesses in the Zone. She added that measures had been taken to ensure that the goods meet international standard before they are exported out of the country. She said the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Nigeria Export Processing Zones Authority (NEPZA) and other supporting agencies coordinated the exporting process of the goods in conjunction with the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), saying that it was a testament to the fact that the Zone was living up to expectation. She said the LFZ, among other things, was conceptualised to develop an offshore economic growth zone, attract foreign investments, promote export, create jobs, transfer technology, minimise capital flight and establish a one-stop business haven. It currently has 22 Free Zone Enterprises (FZEs) and 18 manufacturing enterprises in operation.
