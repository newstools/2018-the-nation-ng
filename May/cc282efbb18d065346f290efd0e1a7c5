A bullion van driver, Mr. Oke Onyeche, has been arraigned before the Lagos State Mobile Court at Oshodi by the Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit (Task force) for allegedly driving against traffic. He was said to have driven against traffic on Ogunnusi Road, Omole bus-stop, Ojodu, Lagos. He pleaded not guilty. Chief Magistrate Amos Olajuwon will on Friday rule on the case. Prosecuting counsel Oseni Ibrahim said the driver’s prosecution was to deter other road users particularly those on essential service from flouting the law. Task force Chairman Olayinka Egbeyemi, a Superintendent of Police (SP), said majority of traffic offenders were educated people, who ordinarily should have obeyed the law without any strict enforcement. Egbeyemi urged motorists, particularly commercial bus drivers to desist from driving against traffic and obey traffic signs. He said the construction of alternative routes in some parts of the metropolis was to ease traffic congestion. Onyeche allegedly said he drove against traffic because he wanted to get to his destination on time. “I want the government to please temper justice with mercy,” he was quoted as saying by the task force.
