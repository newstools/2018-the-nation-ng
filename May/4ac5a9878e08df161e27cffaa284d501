The crisis rocking the All Progressives Congress (APC) would have been worse but for President Muhammadu Buhari’s Reconciliation Committee headed by the party’s National Leader Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the Coordinator of Buhari Support Organisation in Ondo State, Mike Adeyanju, has said. Adeyanju said setting up of the Committee was recognition of the problems confronting the party and the resolve of Mr President to ensure that all shades of opinions and interests were accommodated in the larger interest of the party and the country. He noted that Tinubu’s Committee could best be described as “work in progress” for the party. He, however, noted that going by the look of things, the party’s national convention might not be rancour-free. Adeyanju, who is a member of the Security Sub Committee of the Convention, appealed to members of the party to follow due process during the convention. Adeyanju, a House of Representatives aspirant for Akoko North and East in Ondo State, said: “For now the party has put the mechanism in place and all the party structures are working to ensure that a successful national convention takes place. In politics all interests cannot be accommodated. And we can only appeal to members to show the spirit of give and take. “The security sub-committee will do its best to ensure that the convention is free and fair. And it is our hope that it will be quite different from some of the experiences recorded during the congresses at the states. “But I can assure you that with the level of commitment and reconciliation that is on-going in the party, we would not witness what happened in 2014 in PDP where some people staged a walk out at the National Convention of the party”.
