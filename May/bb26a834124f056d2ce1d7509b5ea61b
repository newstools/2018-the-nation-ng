The Coalition of Civil Society Groups against Terrorism in Nigeria have asked International right group,  Amnesty International (AI) to quit its operation in Nigeria or face a possible Mass Action by the Nigerian people, over what it termed as the  “covert and clandestine operations of the AI, meant to undermine Nigeria’s National  security and foreign policies, through deliberate inciting and false allegations against the Nigerian Military” At a Press briefing in Ibadan on Thursday, Convener of the  group, Comrade Odeyemi Oladimeji said “We have observed that AI  activities in Nigeria are undoubtedly  covert and clandestine operations meant to undermine our security and foreign policies, by deliberately, inciting and making false allegations against our Military,  especially the Nigerian Army.  Whereas, we have gathered from close monitoring that this covert operatives of AI are also working with some local collaborators who are politically exposed including  a former Nigerian president,  who is hell bent on bringing down the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari for selfish and self serving reasons.” According to the group, the AI through many of its actions in Nigeria, especially it frequently released reports, have constituted itself as an agency, that embolden the activities of  terror groups such as Boko Haram by continuously portraying the Nigerian security agencies as the aggressors. “We wish to emphatically state, that Nigerians have had enough of the absurdities and campaign of calumny by the Amnesty International and therefore demand, that it quits its operations in Nigeria, with immediate effect, as we can no longer allow such self serving organisation like AI, to continually undermine our National security, at the detriment of the lives and properties, of our innocent citizens.” “Having constituted itself as a clog in the wheel of progress of our gallant security forces, who have continued to give their best, including sacrificing their lives, for our protection and that of our territorial integrity, we wish to state, that we shall no longer tolerate  these deliberate acts of sabotage and  compromise of national security by the Amnesty International.” Odeyemi further said that failure of Amnesty International to quit Nigeria, as demanded by the group, would leave the Coalition, with no other option than to employ any legitimate means, to force Amnesty International out of the country.
