The former Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof. Attahiru Jega, on Monday charged President Muhammadu Buhari to take his anti-corruption campaign beyond embezzlement. He made the call while speaking on “Peace Building and Good Governance for Sustainable Development in Nigeria” at the 2018 Democracy Day Lecture in Abuja. Jega specifically charged President Buhari to beam his anti-corruption searchlight on National Assembly committee chairmen who asked for bribe to pass budgets of Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs) and when they go on oversight function. Also calling for total reform of the public service, the ex-INEC chief urged the present administration to avoid the fire brigade approach in handling the herdsmen/farmers crises among other security challenges in the country. He also INEC is presently facing challenges that could mar the 2019 general election. He said one of the challenges is violence, stressing that inability of the political parties to peacefully carry out internal elections will rub off on the 2019 elections when parties need to contend with one another.
