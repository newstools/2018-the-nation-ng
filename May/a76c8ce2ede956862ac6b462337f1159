The All Grand Alliance Party (AGAP) in Ekiti State has elected Mr. Steve Oribamise as its candidate for the July 14 governorship election. Three aspirants including Oribamise and Sola Oluponmile contested for the party’s ticket but one was disqualified on account of age. Oluponmile has been chosen as the party’s deputy governorship candidate. AGAP National Chairman, Mr. Okey Chikwendu, expressed satisfaction with the conduct of the primary which held at Little By Little Hall, Ado-Ekiti, the state capital describing it as transparent and credible. Chikwendu said: “We had three aspirants but one of the aspirants, Mr. Ifemide, who commands a massive youth followership was underaged constitutionally to contest the gubernatorial election. “The Screening Committee set up by the NEC recommended that he be stepped down from contesting the election so he was advised that he could not participate in the election. “We are happy that a very transparent primary was conducted, which has produced Oribamise as our elected party flag bearer. “Our party’s flag was ceremoniously handed over to him and in his acceptance speech, he requested to have Oluponmile as his deputy and he accepted. “We asked the Ekiti people and youth especially to come out en-masse and support AGAP as we ultimately desire to bring prosperity to the people.”
