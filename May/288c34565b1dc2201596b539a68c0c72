DR Congo came away from the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium with a credible performance and result yesterday, scoring with 11 minutes remaining to draw 1-1 with Nigeria. William Troost-Ekong scored for an experimental Nigeria side but Malango Ngita equalised for DR Congo in the 79th minute. Simy Nwankwo and Junior Lokosa were handed their debuts in the game, and Arsenal winger Alex Iwobi replaced Kelechi Iheanacho in the 46th minute. Starting sluggishly, the away side were on the ropes early on. Simy ghosted to the box and released a shot which hit the bar. Goalkeeper Francis Uzoho stuck out his legs to thwart Benik Afobe from close range in the seventh minute. The opener arrived in the 14th minute. Ogenyi Onazi’s floated free-kick wasn’t well dealt with by the Congolese defenders, the ball arrived in the path of Ekong who applied the finishing touch. As it is typical for these friendlies, much of the game was quiet but for Afobe was found by Issama Mpeko to flash the ball across the face of goal late in the first half. Debutant Simy was menacing in the game despite being starved of service. The striker delivered a brilliant header from Ola Aina’s long thrust which forced goalkeeper Anthony Mossi to a save. DR Congo pressed forward to equalise and attacked with intent. Mpeko was denied from close range by Uzoho. And that warning sign wasn’t heeded by Nigeria. Aina, who replaced Echiejile at half-time, should have let it go. He hauled down Mpeko and the referee pointed to the penalty spot. The tackle was outside the box. Malango Ngita sent Uzoho the wrong way for the leveller.
