The number of Nigerian doctors working in the United Kingdom has been increasing, according to research by fact-checking organisation, Africa Check. Last year, the number of Nigerian doctors registered with the UK General Medical Council nearly doubled, an increase of 89 per cent, the BBC reports. “In 2016, a total of 245 doctors registered in the UK. The number sharply rose to 439 last year, taking the number of doctors to 5,060,” Africa Check said. So far this year, on average 12 Nigerian doctors were being registered every week, bringing the total number to 5,250 on April 28, the body said. The first year for which data was listed – 2006 – showed 2,692 Nigerian doctors registered. The BBC says it is not clear yet why the numbers have risen so rapidly.
