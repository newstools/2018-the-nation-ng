Gov. Nasir El-Rufa’i of Kaduna State has reaffirmed  his  determination to ensure peaceful coexistence in the state as part of his administration’s cardinal objectives. Gov. El-Rufai  made this known on Tuesday in Kafanchan, Jema’a Local Government during the All Progressives Congress (APC) rally ahead of the local government polls in the state. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Kaduna State Government has slated May 12 for the conduct of local government elections. While addressing APC party faithful, El-Rufa’i said peaceful coexistence was necessary  for rapid development of the state. “This government has recorded meaningful development with the provision of healthcare, quality education and infrastructure development given  the lean resources it has inherited and is determined to do more for the people,” he said. Presenting the APC chairmanship and councillorship candidates ahead of the election, the governor urged the people to turn out en masse to vote for the party to enable it to achieve  its set  objectives. On his part, the State Deputy Governor, Mr Bala Bantex, noted with satisfaction the renovation and equipping of Kafanchan General Hospital alongside other primary health facilities in Southern Kaduna. “The situation now has tremendiously improved from the dilapidated structure we inherited,” he said. Bantex commended  the residents of Jema’a Local Government for putting aside their differences to chart a common course. He urged the people to support the party’s candidates who would in turn deliver on their electoral promises. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Gov. El-Rufa’i, with his entourage, had visited Zangon Kataf, Kachia, Sanga, Jaba and Kagarko local government areas and presented party flags to the Chairmanship and Councillorship candidates ahead of  Saturday’s polls.
