The Chief Imam at the Lagos State Secretariat Mosque, Alausa, Alhaji Muhammed Abubakri Raji, has called on Muslims to support the re-election of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. This, he said, will ensure continuity of achievements witnessed in the last three years. The cleric said Ambode has brought modernisation and infrastructural growth to Lagos. He spoke in Alausa at a Special Jumat Service organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs to mark the governor’s three years anniversary. Alhaji Raji urged civil servants to pray for continuity of peace-coexistence and religious harmony in the state. According to him, Ambode does not discriminate. “He is passionate about Lagos and cares for Lagosians; he is very responsive to their desires. These are sterling qualities of a good Muslim though our governor is a Christian. He has the qualities of a righteous Muslim. In the past three years of his administration, he has worked assiduously to develop the state. Ambode deserves a second term,” he said He said Ambode should be commended for ensuring security in the state. “The governor’s prompt actions to stamp out Badoo cults and kidnappers when they threaten the state with their devilish and dastardly acts are commendable. He should be supported for bringing development to the grassroots and impacting positively in the lives of ordinary Lagosians,” he said. Commissioner for Home Affairs Dr AbdulHakeem AbdulLateef said Governor Akinwunmi Ambode would not relent to transform Lagos to a Smart City that would be the pride of all Africans. Lagosians, he said, should continue to keep fate with the governor as he (Ambode) would always implement programmes and projects to keep the state in the forefront of development.
