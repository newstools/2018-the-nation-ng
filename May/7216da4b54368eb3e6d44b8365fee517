Traditional rulers in Andoni area council have urged security agencies in Rivers State to tackle killings in Bonny Local Government. The monarchs said between April 9 and 22, those living in the suburbs of Bonny were attacked. “The attacks were on Andoni people living at Finima, Ajalimoni and Light House Fishing settlements. “They have led to loss of life and property. The causes of the attacks are yet to be ascertained,’’ the rulers said in a statement by King Aaron Ikuru, council chairman. They said Andoni enjoyed a relationship with Bonny as fishermen in the same council. “We are worried over the poor state of security and recent economic downturn. “We urge the government and security agencies to investigate the crisis, to restore peace to the area. “It is unfortunate that a statement credited to King Asimini Pepple, paramount ruler of Bonny, said the attacks were cult-related. “We call on traditional leaders and the people of Bonny Local Government to eschew sentiment and restore peace to the once economically-viable fishing settlement,’’ said the statement. It was signed by council Vice Chairman King Okuruket Nnabiget XIV and Treasurer King Israel Otuo.
