In preparation for the coming rains, Lagos State Government has embarked on an inspection tour of dump site facilities across the state with a view to ensuring that operators comply with standards. Commissioner for the Environment, Mr. Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti said this while leading a team from the Ministry to the dump sites earlier. Durosinmi-Etti  said government has directed that additional platforms should be created at the dump sites, while  operators of dump sites and Transfer Loading stations have been asked to urgently apply  deodoriser to douse odours emanating from waste. He expressed the confidence that a cleaner and healthier Lagos was achievable if all hands were on deck through the cooperation of all stakeholders. At Solous 3 and Ewu-Elepe dump sites, where he inspected the ongoing road rehabilitation to ease traffic and enhance the turn-around time of compactors, he urged the operators to expedite the construction of the exit road for free movement of compactors in and out of the dump sites. At these dump sites and Agege Transfer Loading Station compactors were seen dumping and moving in and out without hitch.
