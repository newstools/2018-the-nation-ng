Niger State Police Command has intercepted and arrested a four-man gang, which allegedly manufacture firearms (dane guns) at Zungeru in Wushishi Local Government. The suspects include 54-year- old Badamasi Umar, 45-year-old Adamu Aliyu, 40-year-old Kabiru Tukura and 40-year-old Isyaku Madaki. Umar said he had been in the business for long, as people from other parts of the state and country ordered for his guns. “I’m known in my area as someone who manufactures local guns. People from other parts of the state and country order my guns. I have been in the trade for four years. “I produce local guns and sell to anyone that needs them. I am not interested in what the person uses the gun for. It may be for hunting or for security purposes. I sell the guns to make money to maintain my four wives and pay my children’s school fees,” he added. Umar said vigilance groups and security companies “buy our guns”, adding that he never knew there was a ban on illegal firearms, as he would have stopped. The Nation learnt the suspects were trailed and arrested by the Joint Task Force patrol deployed in Zungeru. Spokesman Muhammad Abubakar said the suspects had confessed to the crime, adding that 12 dane guns were recovered from them.
