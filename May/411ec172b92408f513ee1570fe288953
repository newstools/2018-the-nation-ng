The graduate of Geography from the University of Maiduguri, Borno State, and the youngest high-ranking police officer in Nigeria was seen spending some quality time with his children on a farm. The photos were shared on his Facebook page.  One thing is obvious; Kyari,who   has been labelled ‘Nigeria’s Jack Bauer’ due to his effort in bringing high-profile hoodlums  and criminals to justice dotes on his family and his children.
