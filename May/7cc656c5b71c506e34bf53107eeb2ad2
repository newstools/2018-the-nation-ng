The Ekiti State All Progressives Congress (APC) Elders Forum has endorsed President Muhammadu Buhari’s bid for a second term. The group described the president as a great leader, who is tackling the challenges of nationhood and development. Rising from its monthly meeting held at the residence of its Chairman, Chief George Akosile, in Igbara-Odo,  the forum said Buhari deserved a second term because of his performance in the last three years. In a communiqué by Akosile and the Secretary, Chief Abiodun Ajayi,  the forum hailed  the rejection of tenure elongation for party executives at ward, local government, state and national levels. On the Ekiti governorship primary, the elders advised  delegates to be “rational and be guided by maturity, experience, good character” in the choice of the candidate for the July 14 poll. The forum urged the aspirants to refrain from using hate speeches, asking them to work as a team to win the election. The elders also urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to conduct credible, transparent, free and peaceful election. They urged the government to fill vacant  positions in the federal boards, agencies and parastatals in respect of Ekiti APC members. The elders advocated that Ekiti should be included in the School Feeding Programme of the APC-led Federal Government.
