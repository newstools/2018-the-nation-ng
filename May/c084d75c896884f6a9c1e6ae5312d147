Staffs of the Obafemi Awolowo University ( OAU ) Ile Ife have reacted to the closure of the varsity gate and some strategic points by the officials of the Osun state revenue at the early hours of yesterday. One of the staff who pleaded anonymity told our correspondent that both the Faborode and Bamitale Omole-led administrations are the cause of the problem the varsity is going through. The issue has been a carryover from Faborode’s administration. She further explained that the Bamitale Omole administration used its Technical varsity building project as an excuse for nonpayment. The building project is the primary reason why the deficit payment by the varsity to the state revenue service accumulated. Comrade Akinnibi, an Elder statesman of the Non Academic Staff Union of Universities, OAU Branch, said “the school should return what belongs to the Osun state Government even though the money has been in existence before the Ogunbodede led administration. They should return what they owe the state.” Another official of the varsity who pleaded anonymity said, “Ogunbodede is doing his best to make sure things work out well.” “All activities have been crippled because the keys to our different offices are all inside the Senate building which has been locked up by the Aregbesola-Led administration. “The school bursar should also be held responsible for the accumulation of debt by the school a source.” Attempts to get to the Vice Chancellor, Public Relations Officer and other officials to give additional clarifications and information proved abortive as their phone lines were not reachable. It can be recalled that the school senate building has been shut down by the Osun State Revenue Service over the debt of N1.8bn owed by the school.
