Niger Woods returns to competition this week at the Wells Fargo Championship making no excuses in not keeping more in contact with golf’s younger generation of stars. Woods joins now fellow Augusta National champion, Patrick Reed teeing-up both for a first occasion since last month’s Masters at Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina. And while Reed’s been on a whirlwind few weeks donned in the famed green jacket, Woods put away his clubs for 10-days simply ‘chilling out’ with his two children before getting back into training and working on his game ahead of his seventh event this season. “I threw my clubs in the closet for about 10 days and just got away from the game not touching a club or making a swing,” Woods said. Woods says he’s now focussing on the events ahead, including next month’s U.S. Open and July’s 147th Open Championship at Carnoustie, and so much so, it’s meant he’s not had time to phone the likes of Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and golf’s 20-something superstars as Woods had done so often throughout his rehabilitation from a fourth back surgery. “No, they’re still friends of mine and we still text each other but I am now working on my game and there is less time for them to either come out to dinner or ask me questions of hop on the phone”, said Woods. “I’m busy with my kids. I’m busy trying to prepare and practice myself and get ready. “I think you may forget how much time it takes to practice and to get ready, and I have to spend the time to do it”. Woods will play the opening two rounds of the $US 7.2m alongside Reed and reigning U.S. Open winner, Brooks Koepka.
