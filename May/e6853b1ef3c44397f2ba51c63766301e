The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) Zone B has decried the negligent posture of the Federal Government towards the Federal University of Petroleum Resources, Effurun (FUPRE). Making the pronouncement on Tuesday last week, the Zone’s Coordinator, Okereke Godson, described as irresponsible government’s refusal to adequately fund FUPRE as a specialized university. As a result, he said the University was without adequate infrastructure to perform her role as the first petroleum university in Africa and sixth in the world. He said the exclusion of FUPRE in the 2018 budget amounted to marginalization of not just the university but the entire Niger Delta people. He said the university was supposed to train youths to acquire the required skills in the oil and gas sector so as to stop capital flight through the engagement of expatriate staff. Godson said that the struggle was not for FUPRE students alone but all Nigerian students and urged the Federal Government not to play politics with the implementation of FUPRE Act, but urgently address the anomaly. The NANS zone B converged in FUPRE in solidarity with the students of the University who had been protesting the non-inclusion of FUPRE in this year’s budget. Welcoming the students, the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof Akii Ibhadode, appreciated the students for their non-violent approach. He said the government had a procedure and expressed hope that there was still time to include FUPRE in the budget in line with the provisions of its establishment Act of 2017.
