With the controversy stirred by allegations and counter-allegations over the alleged $16 billion investment in the National Integrated Power Project (NIPP) still raging, another report has shown the identities of 27 companies that benefited in the cash, reports Managing Editor YUSUF ALLI. FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration spent about N1.2 trillion on the controversial National Integrated Power Projects (NIPP), an Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) report has said. But only N360.7billion had been paid to the contractors — as at 2007 when Obasanjo exited power. The administration also spent N273.65billion on Power Holding Company of Nigeria from 1999 to 2007. According to the report, which was compiled using the naira, 27 companies got the contracts for transmission lines. Compiled by former EFCC Chairman Ibrahim Lamorde when he headed the agency in acting capacity, the report was said to have been handed over to a former Chairman of the EFCC, Mrs. Farida Waziri, when she resumed office. According to the report, exclusively obtained by The Nation,the figures were arrived at after extensive investigations by the anti-graft commission. President Muhammadu Buhari has accused former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s administration of blowing $16b on power. Obasanjo replied that he was never indicted, adding: “The answer is simple: The power is in the seven National Integrated Power Projects and eighteen gas turbines that Chief Obasanjo’s successor who originally made the allegation of $16 billion did not clear from the ports for over a year and the civil works done on the sites.” The report said: “Further investigations also revealed that a National Integrated Power Project is currently apace in six zones of the country for which about N1, 230,949,066,528.99 was committed by the Federal Government. “The projects were also at different levels of completion but as at the moment of this report, N360, 714, 147, 700.03 has been paid out to contractors, leaving a balance of N870, 234, 918, 828.06 yet to be paid, pending the completion of the project. “After an in-depth investigation and rigorous check on all documents relating to these contracts, the payments made so far, and the contractors handling the project, it is impossible to draw a nexus between the former President or any individual or companies associated with him and the proceed accruing from the contract payments.” On the defunct Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), the report claimed that about N273.65billion was released to the agency between 1999 and 2007 for its day-to-day activities. Also, the PHCN separately received N22.297billion and 162,467.57billion; US$445.244.630.07million; Euro 20, 105,436.31million; and £8,987,322million for about 27 contracts on electricity generation and transmission. The report adds: “On the issue of NEPA (now the Power Holding Company of Nigeria), investigation has revealed that between 1999 and 2007, over N273.65billion has been received by the institution and not N521billion as alleged. This appropriation is for its day-to-day activities, including generation of electricity, its transmission and distribution to the people of Nigeria. “Investigations have also revealed that various contracts in relation to generation of electricity transmission were awarded which amounted to N22.297.162, 467.57billion; US$445.244.630.07million; Euro 20, 105,436.31million; and £8,987,322 million. All the documents relating to payments have been checked and scrutinised and there was no reference whatsoever to the former President, his relations or any front who benefited from the contracts.”  The report listed some of the 27 contracts as follows:  A report of the  Presidential Review Panel on the NIPP set up by the National Economic Council (NEC) said  as at 2007, “total project allocations/estimates for NIPP” amounted to $10.231 billion, including the $2 billion Federal Government counterpart funding for Mambilla Hydro Power project and $1.4 billion for additional nine turbines. According to the then Governor of Benue State, Mr. Gabriel Suswam, who made the presentation of the panel’s report, “ out of these commitments, only $3.08 billion was funded and scrutinised with advance payment guarantees from “first class” Nigerian banks and Letters of Credits issued by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).  Over $1.5 billion of the sum is still in the custody of the banks.” But the report said: “The committee  agreed that completing the project as initiated is the right way to go.” The NIPP contracts were actually executed from the crude oil sale windfall, which was kept in the Excess Crude Account (ECA). But the Revenue  Mobilsation  Allocation  and  Fiscal  Commission (RMAFC) declared the deductions/withdrawals from ECA as illegal because the cash belonged to the 36 states and the 774 Local Government Areas. It also obtained an injunction restraining the Federal Government  from withdrawing from the account. Most of the states also filed matters in court to challenge the withdrawals from ECA by the Federal Government.
