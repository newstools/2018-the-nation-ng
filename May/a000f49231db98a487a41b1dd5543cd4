Penultimate Friday, urban highlife singer Adekunle Gold played to a choice audience at the third edition of ‘Trace Live’ at the Terra Kulture Arena. Tagged ‘Trace Live Presents Adekunle Gold: About 30’, the event started with Gold’s band 79th Element serenading the crowd before he performed his songs. He wrapped things up with a choir backed emotional rendition of his current hit song, ‘Ire’ off his sophomore album ‘About 30’ to be released later this month. The red carpet kicked off at 6pm with guests enjoying cocktails provided by Hennessy and Pepsi. Adekunle Gold’s highlife infused sound clearly strikes a special chord with music lovers, demonstrated by the crowd in attendance, including Falz The Bhad Guy, TEC of Show Dem Camp, Dice Ailes, CDQ, Falana, Kaline, Ric Hassani, Pencil, MC Acapella, Lamide Akintobi, Lala Akindoju, Tania Omotayo, Afua Osei, Bolanle Olukanni and several housemates of the just concluded Big Brother Naija Season3, among others. The event also featured an interactive element where Gold’s fans got to ask questions by Twitter, which showed on the main screen and Gold answered in-between songs. According to Sam Onyemelukwe, Trace Managing Director, Adekunle Gold still maintains the space he has occupied since his entrant into the music industry. “AG just proved why he holds a special place in the music Industry and he has set the bar really high for the next artist who is lucky enough to feature on Trace Live. By the end of the show the entire audience was out of their seats and dancing. We will proudly broadcast this thrilling show on Trace channels across Africa and Europe,” he said.
