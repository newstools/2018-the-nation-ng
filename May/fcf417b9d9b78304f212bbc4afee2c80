“I have this girlfriend of mine and we have been dating for five years now…still on. Now the problem is my feelings are dropping rapidly by the day because she has gotten fat,almost twice my size. Her level of sarcasm and sense of humour isn’t so great and that I really fancy in a relationship but I was prepared to overlook that and still take her as a wife cos I like her. However, with this weight gain, I just can’t. I need advices from people before I know what step to take next. Perhaps I might be over reacting. I’m currently not in the country, so breaking up with her might make her family think it’s because I’m abroad. It isn’t true because I have plans for us. I registered her into fashion designing so when she gets here she can start up something, she is still undergoing training on that so yes I actually want to wife her but I don’t like overweight girls…it’s just not me. I didn’t meet her that way so why would she change on me. And before they come for me to judge me, this issue has been on for more than 2years now, before I left the country. I have cautioned her to watch it but she didn’t and now here we are. Recently I told her to register up for a gym class that I would foot the bills, she went for a month and then told me she was feeling sick went to see a Doctor and the Doctor said she should stop the gym class and even stop dieting that it might affect her from child birth in the future. Doctors in the house please help me decipher that message because I don’t understand. It’s the first time I would hear anything like that. Said she would do after all her kids…she wan blow for my house….issoriat. This girl is just 21 looking like my aunt with 3 kids. What is your advice for me?”  You can also share your story with us @info@thenationonlineng.net
