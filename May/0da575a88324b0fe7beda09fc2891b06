I am happy we are unveiling this trailer today and I look forward to everyone enjoying ‘Lara and the Beat’ in the cinemas from July 20.” Scheduled for cinema release on July 20, 2018, the film which explores the theme of financial literacy, family values, sisterhood, friendship, music, fashion, culture and love has the support of Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), an agency which believes that this handshake with the film industry is the best way to spread the vital message of civic duty and civic responsibilities. “We have partnered with the movie, ‘Lara and the Beat’, because we identify so much with the movie industry’s power to tell our authentic stories, and indeed, Lagos State has an inspiring story to tell. Lagos is at the centre of this film and with the way the state is showcased you can clearly see taxpayers’ money at work. Through this partnership we want people to see why it is important to comply with civic responsibilities, as well as recognize how discomforting it can be when one fails to perform their civic duties,” said LIRS Chairman, Mr. Ayodele Subair. Other partners include, FIRS, Fidelity, Close-Up, Knorr, M-Cash, Jumia, Kilimanjaro, Studio 24, Nuli, Distell, Dominos, Coldstone, and Keexs.
