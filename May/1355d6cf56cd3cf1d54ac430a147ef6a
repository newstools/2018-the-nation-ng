Human rights activist, Hajiya Aisha Wakil (a.k.a Mama Boko Haram), is not about to stop negotiating for peace with the terror sect, Boko Haram. She is confident that many of them will, in due course, see the need to embrace peace and return home. “All my sons in the bush will come home and surrender for peace,” Aisha Wakil said yesterday during the commissioning of the multi-million naira office complex and fund raising of her non- governmental organisation, Complete Care and Aid foundation in Maiduguri. She added: “I will not stop from negotiating for Boko Haram to be granted amnesty and to be accepted by the people in the society. “These are our own children and we cannot throw them away. We must accept them back if they decide to return home.” She said her foundation; Complete Care and Aid foundation was established to care for victims of insurgency including orphans, displaced and the vulnerable children. It is also intervening in education, health care and psycho-social support. Over N100 million was realized at the event.
