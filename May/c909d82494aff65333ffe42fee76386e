Two friends, who allegedly impersonated police officers to steal a motorcycle valued at N200,000, yesterday appeared before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court. Mohammed Usman, 30, and Adamu Mohammed, 30, are being tried for alleged conspiracy, impersonation and stealing. Prosecuting Sergeant Innocent Odugbo said the offences were committed on April 29 at Suberu Close, Shogunle, Lagos. Odugbo said the accused stopped a motorcyclist on the road, and showed him fake police identity cards, claiming he was under arrest for taking one way. “The accused told the complainant, Mr Oseni Mohammed, that his motorcycle had been impounded and that he should bring N4,000 to recover it. “The complainant begged them to collect N1,000 but they insisted on N4,000 and when they attempted to ride the motorcycle away, the complainant shouted for help,” he said. Odugbo added that a passer-by helped in apprehending the accused, who were about to run away. “The police on patrol met them at the scene and arrested the accused,” he added. The accused pleaded not guilty.
