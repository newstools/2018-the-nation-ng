The Special Fraud Unit (SFU) of Nigerian Police on Thursday arraigned two stockbrokers, Adegboyega Adewale  and Idris Asunmo before the Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja for allegedly stealing N11 million. They were arraigned before Justice Josephine Oyefeso on a two- count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The prosecution counsel, Emmanuel Jackson, alleged that the defendants between January 2006 and May 2007, conspired amongst themselves to steal about N11million belonging to Morgan Capital Securities Limited, formally known as International Capital Securities Limited. He said the offence was contrary to Section 390 (9) of the Criminal Code, Laws of Lagos State 2015 and punishable under same. When the matter was called, Jackson urged the court to admit the charge against the defendants and asked them to take their plea. But counsel to the first defendant, Mr. Solomon Okoye, prayed the court for short adjournment to enable the second defendant’s counsel to appear before the court. He said the counsel was bereaved. The prosecutor did not oppose the adjournment sought by the defence counsel. Justice Oyefeso granted the request of Okoye for an adjournment. The judge said that in the interest of justice, the second defendant should not be denied legal representation. She subsequently adjourned the matter till June 11.
