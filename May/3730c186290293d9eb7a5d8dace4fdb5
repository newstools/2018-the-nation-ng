Award-winning singer, Simi, endeared more kids to her fan base last Sunday in Lagos, during the Children’s Day celebration. The Children’s Day party organised by Peak Milk was also in celebration of World’s Milk Day. So many kids from all over the state gathered at the JJT Park Alausa to catch some fun and Simi made sure she thrilled the kids. With her silky voice and performing her hit songs back-to-back, Simi thrilled the children who sang along with her. It was interesting as the kids kept asking for more performance by the singer.
