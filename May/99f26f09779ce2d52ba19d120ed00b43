A businesswoman, Monalisa Okoye, who allegedly obtained N122 million from a customer under false pretence, was at the weekend, arraigned at an Igbosere Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos. Okoye, 35, who operated under the name, ‘Throne of Grace Interior and Events’, Victoria Island, Lagos, was arraigned before Mrs. K. S. Abdulsalami, by the Force Criminal Intelligence and Investigation Department (FCIID), Alagbon, Lagos. She is standing trial on a 10-count charge of fraud, stealing and issuance of dud cheques. Prosecuting counsel Morufu Animashaun said the defendant committed the offences between September and January this year at 19, Aboyade Cole Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. He alleged that Okoye obtained the money from Mr. Emmanuel Olabode on the pretence of supplying him interior furniture. The court heard that following a breakdown of the deal, she issued Zenith Bank cheques to Olabode, which were rejected upon presentation due to insufficient funds in her account. The offences, according to the prosecutor, contravened sections 32, 287 and 340 of the Criminal Laws of Lagos State, 2015.
