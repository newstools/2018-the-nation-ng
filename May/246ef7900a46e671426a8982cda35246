Academic activities literally came to a halt at the Benson Idahosa University (BIU) when students marked the cultural day. It was a sight to behold as students from several ethnic groups, dressed in elegant traditional attires, trooped out of their hostels to showcase the beauty of their cultures. Before a crowd of guests, comprising parents and guardians, the students took turns to parade their cultural heritages. The audience hailed the revelers as they performed their traditional dance steps to entertain guests at the I4th Cultural Day in the school‘s main auditorium. The event featured cultural dances, beauty pageant and drama. While declaring the event open, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Prof Sam Guobadia, described the day as remarkable, adding that the essence of the celebration was to promote tolerance among students and to help them identify with their cultural backgrounds. A special guest and Nollywood actress, Ada Ameh, urged the students to always elevate their culture wherever they may be, noting that it was only through their culture that they can connect to their roots. The thespian hailed the school for creating a platform for promoting diversity on the campus, saying the event will give students opportunity to learn about other indigenous cultures. According to her, there is unity in diversity when people celebrate other people’s culture. She further advised the students to take their studies seriously in order to be successful in life. She said: “For most of you, your parents have done everything humanly possible to get you to school. The greatest gift you can give back to them is not just allowing the school to pass through you, but graduating as an achiever. This is not just for your parents but for yourself and for your tomorrow.”
