The Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, said on Wednesday the Federal Government has spent about N138 billion on basic education in the country. Adamu stated this at the flag off of this year’s National Personnel Audit of basic education institutions in Nigeria. He said the government, through the Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) carried out audit of public schools’ personnel twice, adding that private schools would be added to this year’s exercise. He said: “The present administration from 2015 to date has released N138billion as matching grant. These funds are being accessed by states and FCT after paying their counterpart contributions. “It is important to note that since its establishment in 1999, the Commission has successfully conducted two national personnel audits of basic education institutions in the country. “These exercises, which were carried out in 2006 and 2010 focused only on public schools. “I am, however, delighted to inform you that the 2018 NPA will cover both public and private basic education institutions in the country.” He said the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari would not fail in providing quality basic education to Nigerians. Adamu added: “One of the key success factors in the effective implementation of the Ministerial Strategic Plan, which was launched last year, lies in having reliable data for planning at all levels of our educational system. “The NPA will go a long way in establishing a strong foundation for the emergence of a Sound Management Information System (MIS) within the Basic Education Sector. “It will also strengthen the current National Educational Management Information System (NEMIS) which serves as a key pillar of the nation’s educational planning architecture.” UBEC Executive Secretary, Hamid Bobboyi, said the personnel audit would provide the Commission with opportunity for comprehensive data gathering of all public and private basic education institutions in the country.
