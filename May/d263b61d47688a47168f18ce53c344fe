A pickpocket has narrated how he stole 1,200 phones between August 2016 and now. Femi Solomon, from Ogun State was arrested last Thursday by Rapid Response Squad (RRS) operatives in Iyana Oworo, Lagos, after stealing a Samsung phone from a commuter in a bus stampede. Solomon, an auto technician, noted that he joined pickpocketing gang in Obalende, where he trade in used cloth popularly called “Okrika”. One of his customers, Ismaila, who was about 50 years old, he said, introduced him to pickpocketing. He said: “I noticed he was coming to Obalende finely dressed with so much money. I told him I was looking for a better job and he assured me of his assistance. I followed and we were moving from one bus stop to the other from morning till evening. He was stealing phones and wallets from passengers inside bus and at bus stops. “For six months I followed him, we could pick six to eight phones and wallets from people without their knowledge. He kept everything to himself, but at the end of the day, he would give me between N4,000 to N6,000 depending on his wish. “On August 2016, I started on my own. I wasn’t bold enough to pickpocket during the day. So, I go out in the evening. I started operation at 6pm and end by 9pm. My target is between four and five mobile phones in a day. Once am able to hit that figure, I stopped operation. I sell phones to a friend based in Lagos Island. “In my rough estimation, I would have stolen 1,200 phones both by standing in bus stops and inside commercial buses. The routes I normally go to are Ajegunle, Iyana Oworo to Ketu, Ketu to Ojota and Oshodi to Mile 2. I operate on Mondays, Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. I also operate at night parties and where there are overnight events.” RRS recovered four mobile phones from him. Police spokesman Chike Oti said the suspect has been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department (SCID) for further investigations.
