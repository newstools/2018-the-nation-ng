Ahead of September 22 governorship election in Osun State, the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the state has inaugurated its steering committee. The chairman is Chief Ademola Ishola and Secretary, Taiwo Akeju. Other members include  Olanipekun Ojo-Williams, Okun Obiyemi and Dr.Segun Ojo. At the inauguration, a leader of the party, Dr. Yemi Farounbi, a former Ambassador of Nigeria to Philippines, declared that the steering committee has executive powers. “Now, the SDP is prepared to win the forthcoming Osun governorship poll. Whether they are incumbent or outgoing, they are going back to their house. If we can register five million members, we ate sure of wining the election. So, I am calling on you members to go and work assiduously. We are ready to accommodate members of other political parties from the PDP, Accord and other parties. When restructuring is carried out, this would pave way for  addressing all the challenges, confronting Nigeria,” he said. Also, the National Vice Chairman of the party, Chief Supo Shonibare, disclosed that leaders of the party had been making consultations in the last six months under the auspices of the Southern and Middle Belt Forum. “We have agreed that the way we run regional government in the 50’s is the way to go. The states will get more powers. The regional governments would be actively involved in managing of states under their jurisdiction. We may create more states,” he explained.
