What are the traditional sources of income of the state government and how much has been accrued from these sources? Niger State traditional sources of income include the statutory allocation, Value Added Tax (VAT) and the Internally Generated Revenue (IGR). The average receipt from these and other revenues is N173 billion from June 2015 to date. We have also marginally increased the IGR to N5.646 billion last year from an average of over N4 billion over the past years. The average statutory allocation during this period is between N33 billion and N35 billion while our VAT averaged at N9 billion. Other sources of revenues received are the Paris Club refund, the bailout, budget support facility and excess crude infrastructure facility which are all from the federal government. All these are totalled at N59.3 billion. The total money from Paris Club received was N27.84 over 2016 and 2017, bailout received was N6.89 billion in 2015 and 2016 while excess crude account infrastructure facility was N10 billion. How much is the total receipts of the Niger State government? The total receipts of the government from 2007 to 2015 were N483 billion, while from 2015 to 2018 first quarter, N150 billion was received. Meanwhile, for the IGR, in 2015, the state generated N5.2 billion, in 2016, it was N4.8 billion. In 2017, it was N5.6 billion, while in the first quarter of 2018,it was N1.688 million. There are contentions on what these funds are used for, can you shed more light on what the funds were used for? Most of these revenues are used for different purposes. Government expended 100 per cent of the excess crude infrastructure development funds on capital projects. Out of the budget support facility of N15.16 billion, 39 per cent was expended on capital projects, while 61 per cent went to recurrent expenditure. The bailout funds were used for salaries and pensions for state and local government workers.  40 per cent of the Paris Club funds was used for capital expenditure while 60 per cent was used for recurrent expenditure. Can you give us the total loan status of Niger State? The state has two groups of ISPOs, one for domestic loans and the other for international loans. The average deduction that we have been paying is N30 million per month for foreign loans while for international loans, we have been paying N500 million every month. When we came in 2015, we were paying an average of N830 million, but we had to renegotiate because the debt load was heavy and to give government head room to be able to implement some capital projects. On the domestic loans; the total debt stock as at December 31st 2015 was N44.7 billion, while as at December 2017, it was N56.7 billion. The debt stock increase is not as a result of a new loan taken between 2015 and today, It is a drawdown on existing facilities. The existing facilities include Fadama programme, CSDP, IFAD Value Chain programme and others in the health sector The outstanding balance of foreign debt as at 2015 was N8.5 billion, while currently it is N17.3 billion. The foreign debt is long term and the term that they come in stream transcends administration. It is not as a result of the present administration debt activities, but as a result of past activities that are maturing. For the N9 billion and N12 billion bonds, the balance as  at May 29, 2015 was N15.7 billion, while as at March 31, 2018, it was at N7.16 billion which means we have been able to reduce it by N7.4 billion.  In terms of commercial bank loans, the outstanding balance as at May 29 2015 was N3.458 billion while as at March 31st 2018 it was N1.221 billion. For federal government supported facilities, the bailout of N4.39 billion and N2.5 billion both have a start date of September 2015 and the end date is May and October 2035 respectively. As at today, the outstanding balance of the N4.3 billion is N4.16 billion while for the N2.5 billion is N2.19 billion For the excess crude account infrastructure development loan of N10 billion, the start date was February 2016 and the end date is February 2036. The outstanding balance is N8.9 billion. We have not yet started repaying the budget support facility. It is still at N15.16 billion The total outstanding for the federal government supported facility is in the region of N30 billion. With all these receipts, what is the status of the expenditure of the state? We have some key expenditures that relate to some multilateral and international partners in terms of funding from 2015 to 2017. Our total releases under multilateral partners were N432 million which is the counterpart funding while for the bilateral partners, it was N17 million.  For international NGOs, the total release was N199 million. For programmes and projects that are in partnership with the federal government, we released a total of N2.2 billion. In terms of expenditure, the state has had between 2015 and 2017. The total capital expenditure in 2015 was N6.8 billion, in 2016, it was N22.5 billion while in 2017, it was N37.8 billion. For subventions to MDAs, N31 billion was expended in 2015, N34 billion in 2016 and N38 billion in 2017. For salaries, the average payment is between N2.3 and N2.4 billion monthly, including salaries for political appointees.  For pensions, we paid N1.63 billion in 2015, N1.78 billion in 2016 and N3.52 billion in 2017. How is the ministry monitoring these expenditures? Niger State Ministry of Finance has taken steps to ensure a high level of transparency in its activities. These include ensuring that all payments that come to the ministry are backed by documents and these documents, especially for capital projects, include letters of awards of contracts. If there is advance payment, we make sure that there is an advance payment guarantee and a no objection letter from the procurement board. The no objection from the procurement board is usually backed by the works certificates from the MDA concerned. There is a process where the MDA issues a certificate and the procurement board supervises and verifies that the work has been done and issues a no objection letter for us to pay. Payments are made directly to accounts of companies that have been awarded these contracts. E-payments are made directly from the ministry to the MDAs and the MDAs are advised to make an e-payment to the contractor. There have been some institutional changes that have taken place. Budgetary process has been modified. Also, the financial management aspect has been modified. To this end, we have established an efficiency unit in the Ministry of Finance. We ensure that all recurrent expenditures meet three criteria which include budgetary provision, value for money and compliance with requirements in terms of processing. At the capital end, the Planning Commission does the monitoring to ensure that there is no loophole. They ensure that all capital releases are in line with the budget and there is a budgetary provision for it. All these lead to record keeping. We met a system which we felt we needed for modification. As at today, we have the State Financial Management Information System (SFMIS) which is a holistic software that we implemented with the support of World Bank. SFMIS captures all transactions live. We implemented a trial period during the first quarter of 2018 and we are currently reviewing the results to see the areas where we need adjustment. It makes all transactions live. It does not give an opportunity to manipulate figures. The SFMIS is an important component of the TSA. It is a software interface that doesn’t need a lot of human intervention. It is patterned after the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) of the federal government. Part of its implementation is the enablement to pay salaries without any differentiation between banks. Everyone gets his alert at the same time. It makes it possible not to take schedules to any bank anymore. It is a new way that government intends to use in managing and disbursing funds. We have also entered into some kind of arrangement with Remitta which is the platform used. With Remitta, we are able to interface between the ministry and the financial world.  This is a very important step because it takes a lot of manipulation off and transactions are made live except where there is an error whereby corrective measures are taken.
