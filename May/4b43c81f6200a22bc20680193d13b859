Former Ekiti State Governor Segun Oni has alleged that one of the governorship aspirants nominated the secretary of the Electoral Committee that supervised the failed All Progressives Congress (APC) primary. Oni, an aggrieved aspirant, said the  nomination of a friend of a fellow aspirant put a question mark on the integrity of the exercise. Speaking with reporters yesterday in his Ifaki home, Oni he the APC National Chairman, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, and the National Working Committee (NWC) to investigate the alleged infractions that led to the suspension of the primary. The former Deputy National Chairman (South) claimed that the Electoral Panel Secretary, Magaji Aliyu, is a known ally of one of the aspirants, urging the party leadership to investigate how he was appointed to the panel. He exonerated the chairman of the electoral panel, Governor Umaru Al-Makura of Nasarawa State, from blame, accusing those he referred to as “unscrupulous elements around him.” Oni said: “Those who have penchant for cheating and fraud structured the primary to favour a particular aspirant. I was the APC National Deputy Chairman for four years, despite I never used my position to influence anything about a primary I was directly involved. “When you have penchant for fraud or to cheat the system, it makes democracy to look sour and uninteresting. “How would one feel to get to the field of play and found out that the referee was nominated by one of the teams? We found out that the Secretary of the committee, Aliyu Mogaji,  was nominated by an aspirant and Governor Al-Makura later got to know about this and dropped him from functioning as the Returning Officer.”
