Nineteen persons were injured and over 300 tents destroyed when  windstorm hit Arabic International School Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) Camp at Gamboru-Nagala, Ngala Local Government Area of Borno State yesterday. An eyewitness said the storm started about 3.30 pm and lasted over one hour. Nobody died but the injured are being treated at the camp clinic. A camp official, who pleaded for anonymity, noted that most IDPs are now without shelter. He added that IDPs are prone to such mishaps due to the nature of their shelters and the windstorms associated with rain around the Borno/Yobe axis. He said: “You know that the kind of shelter provided for the IDPs are temporary and so cannot withstand the strong winds that usually come with rain around the Borno/Yobe axis. This period is not good for them. They are vulnerable to these kinds of mishaps.” Officials of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the Borno State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) could not be reached for comments.
