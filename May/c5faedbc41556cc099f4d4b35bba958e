For the second time at the 2018 ITTF World Team Championships, Slovakia became Nigeria’s Achilles’ heels in the quarter-final match of the men’s second division. Having beaten Nigeria 1-3 in the group stage, the Slovakians led by Lubomir Pistej again humbled Nigeria 3-0 in the quarter-final encounter. Apart from the defeat, the unbeaten run of Aruna Quadri was rudely halted by Pistej, who defeated the Nigerian 3-1 to give the Slovakian team an advantage going into the second game between Bode Abiodun and Samuel Novota. In the encounter against Quadri, Pistej copped a knee injury, but the treatment from the medical team put the star back into the game. Having studied Quadri very well, Pistej ensured Quadri did not play much of his forehand. To give the European team the needed win, Pistej beat Quadri 11-7, 5-11, 11-8, 11-4. Abiodun would have restored parity for Nigeria, but the bespectacled Novota pulled some tricks to beat the Nigerian 5-11, 14-12, 8-11, 11-9, 11-7 to lead 2-0. It was the turn of Olajide Omotayo to put Nigeria back into the game, but the defensive style of Wang Yang was too much for the youngest member of the Nigerian side. A disappointed Segun Toriola told NationSport that the defeat to Quadri gave the Slovakian team the needed motivation to go all out. “It was painful that we had to lose to the same team in this crucial stage of the competition. We were also surprised with their set-up because they decided to use their second best player as the third player. Generally, I think we did well winning five matches and losing two to the same team,” Toriola said.
