11,412 smart and determined students across the 36 states of the federation and the Federal Capital Territory recently sat for the qualifying exams to show their SPAK (Speed, Precision, Accuracy & Knowledge) and secure a place in the InterswitchSPAK National STEM competition, registration which opened in February and ran through April 2018, recording a total of 11,412 applications from all over the country cutting across single-sex and co-educational senior secondary schools. According to figures released by the organizers, 47% (5,382) of registered students came from the South West region. The South South region had 1,764 registered students, North Central region had 1,548 registered students, South East coming close to that with 1,362 registered students while the North West and North East recorded less than 1,000 registered students. Lagos state topped the list with 2,280 registered students while states like Jigawa and Borno had 12 and 24 students respectively. It is also interesting to note that registration was equally split between male and female, indicating the strong passion that both sexes have for STEM subjects.
