Ikpeazu delivering a speech, Accelerating Digital Governance at the 4th edition of Transform Africa Summit, holding in Kigali Convention Centre, Kigali, Rwanda stated that African states must tag along in the global technology journey and by collaborating with each other. This is as he noted that technology has too many advantages for any sane leader or society to ignore. Abia governor who used the occasion to share Abia’s experience and breakthrough in using technology to facilitate efficient governance, resource mobilisation and management also highlighted the efforts of his administration in using technology to solve everyday challenges in the state especially in the health sector. “Universal health coverage is one of the bane of Africa societies, leveraging existing technology and the huge teledensity in Nigeria; we have built a platform for digital tele-health system known as dial-a-doc-direct project. This project links all the 292 ward PHCs in our rural communities to a medical call centre where e-consulting, e-diagnosis, e-prescription and e-referral system has shortened the response and service delivery time and cost.” Major government and private sector leaders including President Paul Kagame, Chairman of AU Commission, President of the United Nations General Assembly, Houlin Zhao Secretary General International Telecommunication, Rob Shutter Group President & CEO MTN, Strive Masiyiwa Founder and Chairman Econet Wireless are attending the event.
