The Minister of Youth and Sports,  Solomon Dalung, said on Monday players of the Democratic Republic of Congo National Team, the Leopards, would be screened for Ebola virus before playing the Super Eagles in next week pre-World Cup friendly in Port Harcourt. At least 15 people have been killed in the recent outbreak of Ebola in the giant Central African nation. Speaking with State House correspondents after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari, Dalung said the outbreak of the disease would not stop the friendly match. He said Congolese would be screened before leaving their country and in Nigeria. He said any player that refuses to come to Nigeria through the flight would not be allowed to play the match. He said: “Nigeria is going to play the friendly with DRC. I have discussed with the Federal Ministry of Health with the World Health Organization on the matter. We have reviewed the situation and received adequate information about it. “So we have agreed on major approaches. One, the DRC team is coming through a chartered flight and those coming for the match will be using that chartered flight and they would have been screened from the DRC and here in Nigeria. “No any other person is going to be admitted using any other means of transportation for the match. We also discovered that the Ebola outbreak is limited to a particular place and it has not escalated. “So we wouldn’t want to run the risk of setting a precedent which we will later be a victim. Based on that we only introduced strict policies to ensure that the match takes place.”
