Nigerian actress, movie producer, philanthropist and entrepreneur, Tayo Sobowale, popularly known as Sotayo, on Sunday, April 29, at Radisson Blu Hotel, Ikeja, formally launched her clothing line, Clean Stitches and cosmetic product, Pop It after test running both products for about a year and three months respectively. The event, which also featured the formal launch of her online store, also saw the actress unveiling a new shade of lipstick which she called Lip Stain. “I’ve been designing for over a year now and I decided to bring it public now because I have test run my product over and over again and am sure it’s what people wants. As for Lip Stain, I’m launching now, I have tried it and I’ve being wearing it for about three months and I think it’s time to bring it to the public,” she stated. On the journey to setting up Clean Stitches, she explained that before delving into that line of business, she had no foreknowledge about sewing but was fueled by beautiful designs she saw on people. “I’m not a tailor. I never learnt how to sew. It’s not as if I can’t afford what I wear but when people see what I wear they admire it. Though I didn’t sew them, but they are my designs. I get my material from different places both in and out of the country but the most important thing is that I am able to achieve my desired style with the fabric. I basically any fabric I feel is fine and it doesn’t matter where it is,” the graduate of Public Administration from Olabisi Onabanjo University said. Among those who graced the ceremony were the former Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Adeyemi Ikuforiji, the Lagos State Commissioner for Tourism, Arts and Culture, Steve Ayorinde, hip hop artiste, Olamide and a host of others.
