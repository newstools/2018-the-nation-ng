A former Chairman of Asari-Toru Local Government Council of Rivers state, Ojukaye Flag-Amachree, has been unanimously elected as the Chairman of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers, thereby succeeding Chief Davies Ikanya. The Rivers Secretary of the party, Chief Emeka Beke, and Publicity Secretary, Chief Chris Finebone, were returned unopposed, in the 35-member executive. The rescheduled state congress of APC in Rivers took place on Monday morning at Elekahia Town Hall in Port Harcourt, the state capital, but was boycotted by a governorship aspirant of the party, Senator Magnus Abe (Rivers Southeast), and his supporters.
