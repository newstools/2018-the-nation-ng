An Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court yesterday remanded Ademola Ojomu in prison custody for allegedly raping his wife’s younger sister. Chief Magistrate P. E. Nwaka ordered Ojomu, 32, to be remanded in Kirikiri Prisons, while the case file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for advice. Nwaka adjourned the case till June 26. The accused, who lives at 10, Albert Street, Palmgroove, Lagos, is being tried for rape. Earlier, prosecuting Inspector Christopher John, told the court that the accused committed the offence sometime in 2016 at his residence. He said the victim had been staying with her sister and her husband since 2016 and that the accused had been having sexual intercourse with the 15-year-old girl since then. “Ojomu had been sexually assaulting the girl on different occasions whenever his wife was not around, raping her. The case was reported at the police station and the accused was arrested for questioning,’’ the prosecutor said.
