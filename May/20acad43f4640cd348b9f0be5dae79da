Members of the Joint Health Sector Union (JOHESU) in the Edo State owned hospitals have shunned directives by its national body to join in a nationwide strike action. A visit to the Benin Central hospital showed that all health workers were at their duty post. Patients were attended to at the Accident and Emergency Ward while doctors and nurses were seen administering treatment to patients on admission. It was gathered that the state government met with the health workers and gave them reasons on why they should not join in the strike action. One of the reasons adduced by the state government, according to sources, was that there was no industrial disharmony in the state and that workers were paid salaries before the end of the month. When contacted for comments, State Commissioner for Health, Dr. David Osifo, said he just received notification from the state JOHESU that they would not be joining in the strike action. “They are not joining. They have notified me that they are not joining the strike action”, he said.
