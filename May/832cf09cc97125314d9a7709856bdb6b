NIGERIAN youth international, Kelechi Nwakali is set to return to Arsenal after the expiration of his season-long loan deal with Holland Second Division side MVV Maastricht, AOIFootball.com reports. The former U-17 World Cup Golden Ball winner took to the social media to thank fans, players and staff members of the club for a time well spent. “I want to use this opportunity to appreciate the people of Maastricht and the fans of MVV for their support and love showed to me. I wish you people goodluck. Hopefully, you people will get promoted next season. God bless you all. You people are wonderful,” Nwakali said. Nwakali, who played 16 times for the club and scored four goals, joined Arsenal shortly after his U-17 World Cup heroics. He will be hoping to finally get a chance to feature for the club under the incoming new management.
