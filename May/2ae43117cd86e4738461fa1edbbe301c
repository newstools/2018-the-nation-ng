The management of the Federal University, Oye-Ekiti (FUOYE) has ordered an immediate closure of the institution to prevent a possible breakdown of law and order. The students are protesting the authority’s directive for them to complete payment of their fees before writing exams. FUOYE Acting Registrar, Mr. Daniel Adeyemo, said in a statement on Tuesday the university was shut down over an intelligence report that students had planned to cripple administrative and academic activities under the guise of “musical jamboree.” The irate students had commenced protest since Monday, insisting that they be allowed to write their semester exams despite the fact that majority of them had not completed the payment of their fees. Some of the students told The Nation that they had to embark on the protest because the university management rebuffed their entreaties that they be allowed to sit for their exams and complete payment of their fees later. A student, who craved anonymity said: “We had to protest because it appears the school management didn’t want to listen to our plight. “Also, some administrative officers were preventing many of us who had completed payment and had clearance slips from writing simply because they have not laminated the slips.” Another student said: “Some of the students protesting are not even real students of the university. “You won’t believe that some of these students who are disrupting academic activities on campus, had spent the fees their parents gave them on frivolous things. “Instead of them to go back home and plead for the fees, they are here disrupting the peace on campus.”
