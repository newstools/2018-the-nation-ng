86 years after it rolled out the first bottle in a Malayan brewery in the territory now known as Singapore, World’s No. 1 International Premium Asian Beer, Tiger Beer, finally launched in Nigeria with style. Tiger Beer is a product of Nigeria’s leading brewer, Nigerian Breweries Plc, a Heineken Operating company. The global beer is strikingly bold, refreshingly smooth, and unexpected in every way. The launch campaign tagged #Uncage – the courage to challenge convention – showcased the courageous, bold and go-getting side of Nigerians, encouraging consumers across all divides to ‘uncage’ the courage and the tiger within them in pursuit of their dreams and passions. As part of the lead-up to the launch, a number of celebrated Nigerians took to social media to talk about their fear which symbolically represents other crippling true life stories of fear, limitations and doubt. These stories served as catalyst for their fans and many others to talk about their own fears too and start a conversation around breaking boundaries. “The Tiger Wall and Den are symbolic of the many fears, mental and physical boundaries we have to surmount daily in our pursuits. It’s not simply about heights. Tiger Beer is a beer for the bold, the courageous and the daring, encouraging them to ‘uncage’ bravery in pursuit of passion. Tiger Beer is a rallying point for those who are unknown, those with the potential to change the world; an unseen generation with a tiger inside. They are the ones we say are uncaged,” said Franco Maria Maggi, Marketing Director, Nigerian Breweries.
