Every September, the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) becomes a central hub for film lovers from around the world to experience Festival Street, watch some of the year’s most anticipated films, and discover new international filmmaking voices. Organizing the 11-day Festival is no small feat, and each year the TIFF experience is made stronger and more vibrant through the remarkable support of our Volunteers. This year is no different – TIFF encourages Toronto’s most enthusiastic, motivated, and committed film lovers to apply today! “TIFF is known worldwide as a Festival for the people, and our Volunteers are often the first point of contact that guests seek out when they need information,” says Katy Fahimi-Manzari, Manager, Volunteer and Intern Resources, TIFF. “It goes without saying that TIFF Volunteers play a huge role in shaping and enhancing the guest experience, which contributes greatly to the overall success of the Festival.” Last year, an extraordinary 2,882 Volunteers donated 80,637 hours, which took form through a variety of supporting roles; from Festival Street to theatre venues and helping out in the Industry Centre and with administration, TIFF Volunteers are an exceptionally talented group with a diverse skill set and passion for all things film. To reward the contributions of TIFF Volunteers, organisers endeavour to create a truly positive, fun, and memorable experience that offers the opportunity to gain new skills through hands-on learning, grants access to some of the latest buzzed-about films, and provides a place to foster new and lasting friendships that will stand the test of time. Applicants, who must be at least 18 years old, are expected to send application to tiff.net/volunteer. This year’s edition runs from September 6 to 16, 2018.
