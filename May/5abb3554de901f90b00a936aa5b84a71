Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC) Executive Director Olusegun Awolowo has said the Federal Institute of Industrial Research, Oshodi (FIIRO) is central to the Federal Government’s strategy to boost the non-oil export sector. Speaking in Lagos when he led a delegation of the agency to FIIRO to identify its research findings that are commercialisable and exportable, Awolowo stressed the need to move the country from an import dependent to an export economy. He said to do this, there was the need to work with FIIRO, which has virtually all the resources and technologies that are exportable. He said the relevance of FIIRO to revamp the economy could not be over emphasised, adding that as the hub of indigenous technology, it is prepared to boost the nation’s export earnings. The NEPC chief frowned at the export of raw materials without adding any value to them through processing. He  lamented that the country was yet to harness her petrochemical potential as well as the agro allied areas to increase her  foreign exchange earnings. Awolowo said NEPC’s Zero Oil Plan would help boost the country’s forex. He however forwned at the ignorance of parastatals not knowing what their counterparts are doing. Awolowo said the agency would need FIIRO’s wealth of experience to ensure that Nigerians in the Diaspora have a pool of investment opportunities that abound in FIIRO. FIIRO Director-General/CEO, Prof Gloria Elemo expressed gratitude to NEPC for believing in the technologies fabricated by the institute, adding that this would  further strengthen the ties between the two parastatals. She noted that the relationship would help improve the lot of youths for job creation and poverty eradication. Elemo said FIIRO is the home of indigenous technologies that can compete favourably with their foreign counterparts. The guests had a feel of FIIROs CASSY bread, which is a 20 per cent inclusion of cassava flour in wheat.
