A new youth’s social movement, #voteorshutup2019 has joined the numerous campaign for a desired 2019 elections. Spotted around Victoria Island, Ikoyi and Maryland on Monday, members of the movement took advantage of the early morning commuters traffic to share free voter’s guide booklets, while enlightening the people on the importance of obtaining their PVC and participating in the upcoming elections. According to a representative of the movement, Mr. Osazee Bazuaye, a hospitality and lifestyle specialist; “It is easy for young people to complain, so many young people don’t bother to vote but they love to complain about the elected officials, we want people to come out and vote, we don’t care who you vote for just vote.” The movement started silently early this year and has seen a gradual growth in interest from its peers. Another member, Miss Moe of eventsbymoe said; “we want the politicians to acknowledge the efforts of groups like us, this is something we are passionate about and we are not even politicians so we expect the passion from the politicians to be 100 times more than ours in getting young people interested in supporting them.” The movement is said to consist of part-time volunteers, and interests has grown within celebrities and even peer leaders from other states such as Edo, Rivers and Cross River.
