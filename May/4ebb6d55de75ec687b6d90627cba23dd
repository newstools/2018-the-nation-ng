Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Cross River State yesterday began distribution of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) in the 18councils. Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC) Dr. Frankland Briyai launched the exercise at INEC office in Calabar Municipality Local Government. He said the number represented those who registered under the Continuous Voter Registration (CVR) between April and December 2017. Briyai added that the PVCs included those who applied for transfers and replacement of lost or damaged PVCs. “In addition, we are also distributing over 67,000 PVCs yet to be collected since 2015.” He assured those who registered this year and those who are registering that their cards will be ready before the 2019 elections. The REC said CVR would continue side by side with the collection of PVCs, adding that the exercise would end 60 days to the general election in accordance with the Electoral Law 2010 as amended. He hailed the people for cooperating with INEC, particularly since he assumed duty last year. Briyai advised the electorate against selling or buying PVCs, saying such an act violated the law and punishable by two years’ imprisonment or a fine of N500,000 or both. “As you collect your PVC, I advise that you keep it safe and come out with it on election days to cast your vote. “Remember that having more than one valid voter card is an electoral offence with a fine of N100,000 or a jail term exceeding one year or both in line with the Electoral Act 2010 as amended.” He urged traditional rulers, religious, political and opinion leaders to encourage their followers to collect or register for their PVCs. Mr. Paddy Ali, the representative of the state Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC), advised the electorate to take advantage of their PVCs to exercise their franchise. “Your PVC is your electoral power. You can use it to vote the person you want into power or use it to vote out the person you do not want,” he said.
