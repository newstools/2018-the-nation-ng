The Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos ( UNILAG ), Prof. Oluwatoyin Ogundipe has said that God and not him, was in charge of the administration of the activities of the university. The VC made the statement on Sunday while delivering a sermon at the Redeem Christian Fellowship, University of Lagos Chapter at the Tolulope Odugbemi Hall of the University.  Ogundipe, whose sermon centered on “You shall not be wasted” said God had been the one charting the course of UNILAG since he took over as the Vice Chancellor of the school. The Professor of Botany said he was only an instrument for God – and all he has been doing since he took over as the VC of the school has never been his own initiative but directives from God. Ogundipe, however, advised the students that for them not to have a wasted life they must always acknowledge God in all they do. “Wasted life could either be physical or psychological or in relation to a wasted time. But in proper perspective, when you don’t know God, you are living a wasted life.” “There are some people that there education is wasted. Whether you are a professor or a VC, if you don’t know God, your education is wasted.” The VC, who prophesied that the students’ lives shall not be wasted, charged the students to do away with company of friends that are living wasted lives.  Ogundipe succeeded Prof. Rahmon Bello to become the 12th Vice Chancellor of the University of Lagos in November 2017. Until his appointment as the 12th Vice Chancellor of the University, Ogundipe was the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (Academics and Research) of the university.
