Speaking on the lending rates, Director-General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Muda Yusuf, said such rates further depresses investment and hurt the economy. According to him, it further alienates and causes disconnection between the banks and their customers. “It will be an investment suicide for any businessman to borrow at such rates. It is an abnormality to lend at such rates in an economy that wants to create jobs and recover from recession. I urge the CBN to critically look at those rates and take immediate decision that will boost the real sector,” he said. Yusuf added: “If you want the private sector to be engine of growth, you have to deal with interest rate. Lending to customers at such rates will further increase the level of default of borrowers because the higher the lending rate, the higher the default rate”. On banks’ claims that their cost of operations is high, he said the apex bank can also reduce the Cash Reserve Ratio and Monetary Policy Rate (MPR) to reduce cost of funds for banks. “Banks need to create credit that supports the economy, by boosting production and reducing poverty,” Yusuf said.
