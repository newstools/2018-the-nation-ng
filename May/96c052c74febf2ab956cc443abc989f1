The Snake Bite Treatment Centre, Kaltungo in Gombe, has alerted people in state particularly farmers, to be vigilant, due to the increased number cases recorded in the hospital. Dr Abubakar Balla, the officer in charge of the centre, told Our Reporter in Kaltungo on Monday that 70 snake bite patients were on admission in the hospital. Balla said that the hospital admitted nine to 10 persons daily since the onset of the rains unlike during the dry season when two or three people were treated daily. “We discharge people daily and admit new ones; the situation is bad, and people need to take precaution because prevention is better than cure. “Those going to farm should wear boots, hand gloves and hold sticks,” he said. Balla said that the facility had sufficient drugs supplied by the Presidential Committee on North-East Initiative (PCNI) and the Gombe State Government. He, therefore, advised snake bite victims to go to hospital immediately in order to save their lives. “When a victim’s condition is critical, definitely he or she will require blood transfusion which is not advisable. “Endeavor to come on time, the treatment is free of charge,” the physician said. Thenationon recalls that the Commissioner for Health, Dr Kennedy Ishaya, had said that over 70 per cent of patients who received treatment at the centre were not Gombe indigenes, explaining why the hospital was always over- stretched.
