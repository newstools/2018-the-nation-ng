Elder Johnson Adedoyin, a retired worker with the federal airport authority has called on Nigerians to help revive his daughter, Mrs Adeola Abigael Ojo (Nee Adedoyin), currently in need of a kidney transplant. The 34-year-old Ojo, a mother of one who holds a degree in pharmacy from the University of Jos was abandoned by her husband two years ago after he dumped her in her father’s house, under the guise of going to seek money and special prayers.  The plight began in 2013 when she woke up feeling weak and went for treatment at the national hospital Abuja, where she did her internship. A medical report signed by Dr R.A Olarenwaju, a Consultant Nephrologist at the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital, LASUTH confirmed Ojo has End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). A kidney transplant was recommended, and a family member has pledged to donate a kidney, but the family is in need of N8000,000 to cover the cost of treatment. “We spend between N60,000 to N65,000 for dialysis which is done two times in a week. The dialysis  used to be once in a month, but we now have to do it twice weekly to save her life. Her husband, Rotimi Ojo abandoned her two years ago and the family is left to bear the burden. I’ve spent all my savings on her and things have not been easy since I am a retiree,” elder Adedoyin said. The old man is pleading with kind-hearted Nigerians to come to the family’s aid financially.  Elder Adedoyin can be reached on 08037300555. Donations can be sent to Adedoyin Johnson Olatunji, First Bank. Account Number: 2002394204
