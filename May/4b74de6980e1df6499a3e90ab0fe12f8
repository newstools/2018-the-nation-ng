Nigeria’s Super Eagles officially held their first training session in Uyo on Wednesday morning ahead of their friendly match against DR Congo in Calabar next week, with 17 players involved in the first warm-up, AOIFootball.com can report. Vice-Captain Eddie Ogenyi Onazi led proceedings at the Godswill Akpabio International Stadium’s training turf with Wilfred Ndidi separated from the squad as he continues his recovery from injury. The 21-year-old participated in the team’s ball joggling and warm-up exercises but was separated from the group before the core training session began and was then seen jogging on his own before he was put through some work by fitness trainer, Bernard Gines. Ndidi was injured in Leicester’s Premier League clash against Crystal Palace on April 28 and missed the Foxes’ last three games of the season due and will almost certainly miss Nigeria’s game against Congo next Monday in Port Harcourt. The Eagles are expected to train again on Wednesday evening by 4 pm and should be boosted by the arrival of both Ahmed Musa and Shehu Abdullahi who were both caught on camera in the plane en route Uyo.
