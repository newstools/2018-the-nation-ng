Niger Woods and Phil Mickelson will be playing partners at the Players Championship for the first time in 17 years when the pair go head to head during the first two rounds of this year’s contest. The long-time rivals haven’t been part of the same pairing at golf’s unofficial fifth major since the third round in 2001, where Woods holed his iconic ‘better than most’ putt on the 17th green on his way to a one-shot victory. The 14-time major champion has played at least one round with Mickelson in 22 different stroke play events during their lengthy careers, most recently during the first two days of the 2014 PGA Championship, although featured in a practice round together ahead of the Masters. Woods is a two-time winner of the event but makes his first start here since 2015, while Mickelson – who claimed a two-stroke victory in 2007, makes his 25th Players Championship appearance. The PGA Tour announced that the duo would be part of the Featured Group coverage during the opening two days in Florida, with 2015 champion Rickie Fowler completing that three-ball.
