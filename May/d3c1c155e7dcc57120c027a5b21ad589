The aborted Governorship primary of the All Progressives Congress (APC) aspirants and members of the National Working Committee of the party. One of the aspirant who volunteered information to newsmen at the end of the meeting, Barrister Ajayi Olowo said  the aspirants appealed to the National Working Committee to shift the date to Sunday in view of the fact that they needed time to get back to the their constituency. Olowo also said that the leadership of the party has assured them that a few members of the panel will be changed in accordance with their request, pointing out that with such an assurance, they have no reason not to have confidence in the committee to conduct the primary. He also dismissed the possibility of having a consensus candidate for the primary saying “there is no consensus. We are all going for election”.
