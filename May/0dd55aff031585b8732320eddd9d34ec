The Libya Government is set to implement an integrated plan involving all security services to confront illegal migration through sea and land, in order to reduce the immigrants flows. Minister Mohamed Al-Marhani, made this known during a football event between local football veterans and a group of immigrants from different African nationalities, which was organised by the Libyan anti-illegal immigration department in the capital Tripoli. “Our plan is based primarily on activating desert patrols, especially in the south and south-west of the country, from which most immigrants infiltrated illegally through borders with neighboring countries,” he said. “The plan also activates passport investigations,” which to play a considerable role in checking the official documents of migrants, Al-Marhani added. Al-Marhani said that there is also a plan for the coast guard to carry out rescue operations in the Mediterranean.

Thousands of illegal migrants choose to cross the Mediterranean towards European shores from Libya due to the state of chaos in the country following the 2011 uprising. According to official figures from the Libyan anti-illegal immigration department, more than 4,000 migrants were rescued off the Libyan coast during the first quarter of the year.
