West Ham United have appointed former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini as their new manager on a three-year deal, the Premier League club announced on Tuesday. Chilean Pellegrini left Chinese Super League club Hebei China Fortune on Saturday and replaces David Moyes, who guided the club to a 13th-place finish in the league this past season. “I am delighted to welcome Manuel Pellegrini to West Ham United. “He is one of the world’s most respected football coaches and we look forward to working with him,” West Ham joint-chairman David Sullivan said. “It was important that we appointed someone with knowledge and experience of the Premier League. “Someone who already has an understanding – not only of the teams and players we face – but of West Ham United and our ambitions,” Sullivan explained. Former Villarreal, Real Madrid and Malaga boss Pellegrini returns to England two years after leaving Manchester City, a team the 64-year-old led to the Premier League title in 2013-14.
