Five people involved in organising the March 18 Russian presidential elections in the occupied Ukrainian territory of Crimea were put on the European Union’s sanctions list on Monday. The EU has imposed a range of sanctions over Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, carried out in retaliation for Ukraine ousting its pro-Russian president in what Russia has condemned as a Western-backed coup. EU member states decided to impose travel bans and asset freezes on five individuals, who held positions in electoral commissions in Crimea, which the EU considers “actively supporting and implementing policies that undermine the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine.” The decision brings the total number of individuals sanctioned by the EU over the Ukrainian conflict to 155.
