Not less than 90 percent of goods imported through ports are under-declared, The Nigerian Shippers Council (NSC) has disclosed. This, the Council said, has led to huge loss of revenue for the federal government. The Council also said there was no need for Nigeria to depend on oil because the transport sector has the capacity to finance federal budget. Executive Secretary of the NSC, Hassan Bello, stated these during a courtesy call on the Ag. Chairman of Independent Corrupt Practices & Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC), Dr. Musa Abubakar in Abuja. Bello said: “No matter how hard we try to bring development, there are two key issues, security and corruption. If we don’t fight these, then I am afraid that the progress will not be much. “Corruption at our ports and the transport system is particularly damaging to the economy of this country.” On steps to curb corruption at the ports Bello said: “We have unveiled a technology that will make us know when the containers arrive, their position and everything. “So the issues of dwell time of cargo and collision will be a thing of the past. “We also have the Cargo Tracking Note or Advance Cargo Information System. “90 percent of goods coming into Nigeria are under-declared.  It is not the value. There is massive connivance to reduce the value of goods so that people don’t pay the actual import duty. “Government is losing a lot of revenue and there is so much leakage. “If we introduce the Advance Cargo Tracking Note (ACTN), the value of goods coming in will be known. So there will be no hiding.” He also said the device has the capacity to reduce proliferation of firearms and other illegal items. Abubakar pledged to continue to collaborate with the Council to boost the nation’s revenue.
