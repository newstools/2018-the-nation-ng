… President signs ‘Not too young to run bill’ into law President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday signed the “Not too young to run” bill into law. He jokingly asked the youths not to vie for Presidency next year. The President declared his re-election bid two weeks ago. Urging the youths to wait till 2023 before vying for the Presidency, Buhari said the new law permits them to vie the various political offices in the country. According to him, the new law has reduced the age limit for those seeking places in the House of Representatives and State Houses of Assembly from 30 to 25 years President Buhari said the age limit has been reduced from 40 to 35 years old for those seeking the nation’s highest political office. He wondered why the age limit for Senate and state governors were not reduced in line with the original proposed bill.
