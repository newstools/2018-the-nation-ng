As part of his plan to affect the lives of youths in Ogun State, billionaire farmer and governorship aspirant in the state, Honorable Oladipupo Adebutu, has consulted Nigerian artiste, Raoul John Njeng-Njeng, alias Skales, on how entertainment can be used to promote social and economic values of Ogun. The governorship aspirant, who is son of the owner of Baba Ijebu, a multi-billionaire lottery franchise, stated: “I chose to have this meeting in private and not in the full glare of the public in order to allow the true reason for calling the meeting take place. I understand the importance of the youth and the ever-growing entertainment industry in Nigeria. What I want is to tap into it for the good of my state with the collaboration of Skales, who I consider a brilliant entertainer himself.” On his part, the artiste said: “I have heard a lot about the honorable and his undeniable strength and love for the people of Ogun State. His continuous will to help the youth of the state financially and in educational scholarships during his tenure as Remo Constituency House of Representatives member. I feel honored to be considered a collaborator in his reform initiatives.”
