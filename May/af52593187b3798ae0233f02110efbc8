Those on the boards are the best around and I am sure that they have the wherewithal to moves their respective sports forward. “The Governor has said that he wants to make the state a sports hub, as well as tourism and those who have been listed, are those who can help the Governor actualise that dream,” the source added. It is recalled that the Governor approved the dissolution of the board of the 36 sports associations under the supervision of the LSSC excluding the state football association.
