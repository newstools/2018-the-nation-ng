The Chief of Staff to the Governor of Osun, Gboyega Oyetola has felicitated with children all over the world urging them to brace up for the challenges of the future. This was contained in his message of felicitation with Nigerian children made available to Newsmen on the occasion of the 2018 National Children’s Day. Oyetola who under the umbrella of the All Progressive Congress (APC) is vying for the Governorship post  in the coming September 22 gubernatorial election assured the kids in Osun of his determination to invest massively in the education sector if voted to power, saying he is ready to compliment the efforts of Governor Rauf Aregbesola in education sector. He described them as leaders of tomorrow and also urged them to believe in the possibility of a great and prosperous Nigeria. Urging Nigerian leaders to rededicate themselves to the cause of the children, Oyetola said It is time for Nigerian leaders to quit the lip-service to children’s issues and begin to make their welfare and development a priority. “Children all over the world are regarded as the future of their countries and great pains are taken to ensure their physical, mental and social well-being”. “The greatest investment that any nation can make in its future is in its children and Osun State under the leadership of Governor Aregbesola is doing well to embrace this global reality” he said “The proper upbringing of children is an important responsibility. Giving them the best care that we can afford, as is done in all serious countries, should not be optional.” “All children ought to be properly nurtured so that they can achieve their full potentials and the failure of the government and parents to do this should be actionable. A good example of this is in the O’meal program of Governor Aregbesola where all children of school age are fed nutritious meals daily aside other welfare packages for them” “Although the economic situation in the country is grim, parents must go the extra mile to nurture, educate, mentor and guide their children to thrive in our increasingly competitive world where knowledge is the key” he added
