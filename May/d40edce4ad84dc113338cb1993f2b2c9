With the introduction of ‘Sister Lizzy’s Kitchen’, her initiative to help feed less privileged kids in the society, Nollywood actress, filmmaker and author, Omoni Oboli has assured that the foundation will continue to suffice. Sharing the delight of having the opportunity to feed the kids, which kicked off in Makoko, on her 40th birthday, last April, the mother of three stated; “Do you know that our feeding outreach program is a weekly affair? Every Sunday, we set out to feed at least 500 underprivileged kids. We always surpass that number though. “The least we have done is 700. People keep asking how long we will keep this up. My answer is ‘as long as God gives us sustenance’. Thanks @knorrnigeria for coming with us on this journey I’m making my mama proud.” She has also called on volunteers and partners saying, “Together, let’s do our bit to eradicate hunger”. Sister Lizzy’s Kitchen is an Omoni Oboli Foundation initiative in memory of her late mum which aims at feeding 500 children weekly. The actress spent her 40th birthday with the children of Makoko by launching the feeding outreach which, according to reports, successfully fed over 1200 kids.
