Arsenal have appointed former Paris St Germain coach Unai Emery as the new manager of the club, with the Spaniard succeeding the long-serving Arsene Wenger, the Premier League club announced on Wednesday. Emery, who joined PSG in June 2016, left the French club at the end of this season, having led them to a domestic treble. The 46-year-old had previously guided Spanish side Sevilla to three Europa League titles.
“Unai has an outstanding track record of success throughout his career. “He has also developed some of the best young talents in Europe and plays an exciting, progressive style of football that fits Arsenal perfectly,” Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis said in a statement. “His hard work and passionate approach and his sense of value on and off the pitch make him the ideal person to take us forward,” Gazidis said. Wenger departed the North London club at the end of last season after nearly 22 years at the helm, helping the team capture three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups.
