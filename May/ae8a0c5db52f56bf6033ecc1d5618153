The first ever African Local Government Economic Development Summit will focus on meeting public service needs and strengthening grassroots leadership, the organisers have said. The three-day event, which will hold at Emperor’s Palace, Ekhuruleni, Gauteng, South Africa from June 26 to 28, will see African local government councils gather to network and strategise on development of councils on the continent. The summit’s visioner, Mr. Chris Sanni, said: “We need to foster human capacity development at the grassroots. “If Africans are to make Africa rise again, the impact of the local government is of utmost importance as regional economic development partnerships will work to attract and retain opportunities for economy fortification and improved quality of life.” Sanni also disclosed that subsequent summits will hold in different African countries to forge unity and brotherliness among the participants. South Africa’s Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Mr. Zweli Mkhize will deliver the opening address while President of the United Cities and Local Governments and Chairperson of South African Local Governments Association, Mr. Parks Tau, will give the keynote address. Other speakers include Deputy Director of Nigeria Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Aminu Takuma, and a top risk consultant in the United Kingdom, Mr. Ayodele Kayode. All local government executives are eligible for the Gauteng summit.
