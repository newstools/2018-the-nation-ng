Bayelsa State Governor Seriake Dickson said on Sunday in Kaduna that restructuring portends no doom or evil for Nigeria. Speaking after meeting with Governor Nasir El-Rufai, Dickson said: “By restructuring, we are talking about fundamental constitutional reforms, reforms or restructuring of our country to bring about a fairer and more stable and sustainable Nigeria and all of these within the context of united, indivisible Federal Republic of Nigeria. “There is nothing human that is perfect. Nation building is work in progress and is actually not something that will finish by one leader, party or one government, or even by one generation. It is from one generation to another generation. Our leaders, our founding fathers gave of us this country but we cannot claim that the present structure is perfect.” “No nation is perfect, nation building therefore is continuous work in progress and that is great work and contributions of Governor El-Rufai’s committee, even though the committee of a political party and yet the recommendations are far-reaching and a number of us across party lines believe that we need to advance the conversations. If you ask me, what is restructuring? Restructuring simply means constitutional reforms, constitutional amendments, federalism or now we say devolution of power.” El-Rufai said: “We must all work together ; all hands must be on deck to make our country better. For me, the work of the APC committee on true federalism reflected that consensus among our party leaders and the APC National Executive Committee has adopted our report and set up a technical committee on the implementation. I hope the technical committee will soon report to the party so that they will send the recommendations to the government.”
