Edo State Government has concluded plans to partner with the After Graduate Development Centre to train 200 youths on solar panel installation, photography and cosmetology. The training programme, conducted through Edojobs, is aimed at equipping the youths with in-demand vocational, business intelligence and financial literacy skills. Youths will also be mentored to apply for business funding during the programme. The trainees are to be drawn from Edo North, South and Central senatorial districts of the state. Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to the Edo State Governor on Skills Development and Head of EdoJobs, Ukinebo Dare, expressed her gratitude to the Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki, for attracting the programme which is funded by ACT Foundation to the state. She said that the training will fast-track the realisation of the governor’s promise of creating a minimum of 200,000 jobs. She also noted that it will also equip the 200 participants with skills and resources to be self-reliant as trainees will be guided to access credit from the Bank of Industry (BoI). She also noted that the state’s Ministry of Science and Technology is recruiting new hands for its Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) and encouraged job seekers to get details and apply on the EdoJobs Portal. According to her “application for the 200 slots on the training being run by EdoJobs in partnership with AGDC (After Graduate Development Centre) is ongoing and individuals desirous of becoming brand names in the different fields, should apply right away on edojobs.edostate.gov.ng” The training programmes are on Solar Panel Installation and Maintenance, Photography as well as Makeup and Cosmetology.”
