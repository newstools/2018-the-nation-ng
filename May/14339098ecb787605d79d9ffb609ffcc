Dangote and Julius Berger Construction Companies have begun rehabilitating Leventis Road in Apapa that will serve as the alternative route when the Apapa/Ijora Bridge is closed for repairs. The Federal Controller Works, Lagos, Mr Adedamola Kuti, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) yesterday that it was to facilitate vehicular movements there. Kuti said that AG Dangote Construction Company Limited had completed constructing the concrete slab while Julius Berger was carrying out palliatives on parts of the road. “AG Dangote Construction Company Limited has already completed the concrete slab on the road but it needs 28 days to cure before vehicles can run on it. “However, Julius Berger is currently carrying out palliatives on the pot holes and the bad portions to enhance smooth flow of traffic before we close the Apapa/Ijora Bridge for repairs. “The vehicles coming toward the diversion will have to climb the slab before they can enter into Leventis Road, so the work the two contractors are doing is very important,’’ he said. Kuti said that the Federal Ministry of Power, Works and Housing would not close the bridge to traffic until it had perfected plans for minimum traffic impacts within the axis. He said that there was a meeting attended by all the relevant stakeholders and they came up with a map that would aid effective traffic management and avert gridlock. Kuti said the traffic consultant on the Apapa-Wharf Road Project would also be at alert to tackle all traffic related issues while the closure of the bridge lasted.
