The Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Ibok Ete Ibas, yesterday said more boats had been deployed in the Lake Chad Basin as part of efforts to beef up security in the area and protect the nation’s territorial integrity. Admiral Ete Ibas said the Navy, alongside the Army and the Air Force, are currently in joint clearance operations against the Boko Haram terrorists in the Lake Chad region, stating that the nine boats and Naval personnnel deployed to secure the area are well armed and equipped. He enjoined Nigerians to continue to pray for the success of the military, particularly in the task of securing the nation from terrorists’ and bandits’ attacks, stressing that the amount of resources being deployed to keep the nation secured are huge enough to develop education and health sectors. The Naval Chief made the remarks shortly after a special Jummat prayer at the Defence Headquarters (DHQ) mosque in Abuja to commemorate the 62nd anniversary of the Nigerian Navy. Represented by the Chief of Logistics, Rear Admiral Shuwa Mohammed, the naval boss said: “We need the support of Nigerians spiritually and materially and their best wishes in the fight against insurgency. The country is spending a lot of resources in footing the bills of the armed forces regarding the ongoing campaigns to keep the nation’s territorial integrity secured. “And these rsources are affecting other aspects of the economy. If the resources are channelled to education, health and so on, things would be different today. So we also need your prayers as Nigerians, and for the media, please you are our partners in this war. Always see the good aspects of our efforts to secure the country. “And in respect to our troops in the war fronts, they are in our prayers and we are supporting them with all the logistic aspects of fighting the war in terms of boats, financial support and spiritual support. It is not only for the navy, but also for the army and the air force.”
