The Muslim Media Practitioners of Nigeria (MMPN) has condemned the renewed killings in some part of the country. The group urged the Federal Government to get to the root cause of the “ugly development.” In a communique at the end of the 2nd Convention held at the National Mosque Auditorium, Abuja, MMPN reminded “those who enjoyed killings others in the name of religion that there is no compulsion in religion,” saying “Islam was not spread with force, bombs or killings but with wisdom and good character.” The communique was signed by its President, AbdurRahman Balogun and Secretary to the Convention Hakeem Adebumiti. The group said: “As we approach 2019 general elections, the association calls on all lovers of peace, stakeholders in Nigeria project and media practitioners to ensure justice, fairness, and mutual understanding. There should be no bloodletting, killing and maiming because of power as power comes from Allah. “That as media practitioners, we equally have our watchdog role to play in the society, hence we must advice, guide and inform members of the public correctly, accurately and timely on issues of public interest.” The association congratulated Sultan of Sokoto and President General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA) Alhaji Sa’ad Abubakar on his conferment with the title of Grand Patron of MMPN. The group urged Muslim bodies and more importantly the National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) to always make use of Muslim Media Practitioners in its public relations department.
