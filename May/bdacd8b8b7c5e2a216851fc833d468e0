The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) made over N104 billion in four months and seized two containers of fake drugs at Lagos port, it was learnt. The money was generated by the Tin-Can Island Customs command between January and last month. Although the money was lower than the N116billion target the command set for itself, its performance rate is 90.9per cent. In the corresponding period last year, the command generated N82.154billion which shows an increase of about N22.68billion equivalent to an improvement of about 27.61per cent. The command also intercepted one 40ft and one 20ft containers of fake Tramadol Hydrocloride (225mg) which were declared by the importer as electrical static converters and ciprofloxacin. A suspect was arrested in relation to the fake drugs. The command also seized three 40ft containers of E-waste, five 40ft containers of second-hand clothing and one 40ft container of used tyers which were considered toxic and dangerous to the health of the people, environment and the growth of our nation. Addressing reporters in his office yesterday, its Area Controller Musa Baba Abdullahi said the improvement in revenue collection was driven by the establishment of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and the drive to block all areas of revenue leakages. “Tin-Can Island Customs command is committed to the transformation of our revenue collection and reporting system with the implementation of the Nigeria Integrated Customs Information System (NICIS II) with additional functionality which is an upgrade of the NICIS 1,” he said.  Musa said the command has put in place, biometric access system and a ‘one stop shop’ which enable quick treatment of declarations with valuations, classification and other related issues/queries.  “Automation of the cargo examination and assignment process where examination officers are assign examination automatically, this is designed to ensure transparency in the inspection process,” he said.
