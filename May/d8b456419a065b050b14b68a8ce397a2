The Senate on Thursday held over two hour meeting with the National Security Adviser, Gen. Babagana Monguno, over mounting insecurity in the country. The closed door meeting was part of the security briefing the upper chamber held with security chiefs last week. After the meeting, Senate President, Abubakar Bukola Saraki said that Monguno answered questions bothering on security, insurgency, terrorism, kidnapping, coordination of the security agencies and the general killings in the country. “Thereafter, we directed that he submits a funding request similar to other heads of security agencies that had come before us and to submit consideration where relevant amendments to existing laws involving security agencies need consideration,”‎ Saraki said.
