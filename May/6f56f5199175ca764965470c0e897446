Leicester City has provided an update on the fitness of their players before they take to the pitch for tonight’s Premier League clash with West Ham United. The Foxes manager Claude Puel was very cautious when he briefed reporters as he did not shed any light on the hamstring injury suffered by Wilfred Ndidi and did not state whether or not the midfielder will be fit for the 2018 World Cup. The Nigeria international is one of nine Leicester City’s first-teamers that will not be on parade at the King Power Stadium tonight as a result of the injury he sustained last weekend against Crystal Palace. ”There’s an ankle problem with [Robert] Huth, [Shinji] Okazaki, [Kasper] Schmeichel, and [Ben] Chilwell in training,” Puel told reporters, according to lcfc.com. ‘‘[Matty] James has had tendon surgery. It’s a hamstring strain for [Wilfred] Ndidi and [Daniel] Amartey and [Marc] Albrighton is suspended.” As exclusively reported by allnigeriasoccer.com, the hamstring injury suffered by Ndidi will keep him out of action for six weeks.
