Taraba State Governor Darius Ishaku has promised to make youths millionaires if they elect him for a second term in 2019. Ishaku spoke during his third anniversary and Democracy Day celebration at the Jolly Nyame stadium in Jalingo. He said: “I want you to re-elect us. I will empower you to be millionaires; you will be exporting milk and meat; you will be driving Mercedes Benz, instead of Keke NAPEP. “Today, over 3,000 youths have been employed and thousands empowered through the Rescue Mission’s skills acquisition programme. “Those empowered are now self-reliant and have become employers of labour. The story of Aisha is a good example. Aisha was empowered and she later employed a widow and five others. Today, her business is still running. “When you elected me in 2015, you did not know me well. Now, you know who Ishaku is; now, you know who DDI is, who Daram Dam Dam is, because of what I have done for you.” Ishaku, who said his administration has done well in the last three years, assured the people that he will fulfil his campaign promises in the remaining year.
