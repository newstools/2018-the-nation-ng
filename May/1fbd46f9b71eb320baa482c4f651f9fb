The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) said yesterday that 1,265 candidates in the FCT are undergoing screening for the 6,000 Police job opening. Over 133,000 candidates were shortlisted for the job. The police promised that there would be transparency and proper representation from the 774 local governments which would reflect federal character. The Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) in charge of training, Emmanuel Inyang, who spoke while inspecting the exercise, promised that the screening would ensure that accidental discharge becomes a thing of the past in the Force. He said: “We are here today for the screening of successful candidate willing to join the force. This is a screening of documents to ensure they meet up with the required qualification. We will proceed to physical screening thereafter to ensure they have the correct height, correct chest measurement, no flat feet, no bad dentition, no knock-knees, no tattoo and to ensure they are not deformed because we want to have the best for Nigerians. “After the physical screening, candidates will be subjected to aptitude test to be conducted by the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board (JAMB) to ensure transparency. “After the test, they will undergo another medical screening to ensure they are well and fit for the job. An optometrist would also check their sight and a psychiatrist will also do a mental evaluation to ensure they are mentally okay and not on drugs. “So a case of accidental discharge will be a thing of the past. We want to give Nigerians the best. The screening should be over by early June because training will start in of June.”
