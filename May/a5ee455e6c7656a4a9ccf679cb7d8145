The ECOWAS Youth Council (ECY), a representative body for the youth populations of the 15-nation Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) yesterday honoured former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and a 2019 Presidential aspirant, Kingsley Moghalu, with its Nelson Mandela Award for Integrity and Meritorious Service to Humanity. The award was presented to him at a ceremony in Abuja. A delegation of the EYC led by its President, Emmanuel Williams, said the Council deliberated and decided to confer the unique award on Moghalu in recognition of his vision, service to humanity in the United Nations and the CBN – two critical international and national institutions – and the inspiration he had been to youth in Africa as a role model. The youth leaders noted that they were further impressed when, upon investigation they confirmed that Moghalu’s nomination for the award was not self-sponsored. Moghalu praised the EYC delegation for finding him worthy of the Nelson Mandela Award and noted that the great world leader in his life time was also his own personal role model. He explained his vision for the youth and future of Nigeria as articulated in his four published books: Rwanda’s Genocide, Global Justice, Emerging Africa: How the Global Economy’s Last Frontier Can Prosper and Matter, and Build, Innovate and Grow (BIG): My Vision for Our Country. This vision, Moghalu said, is focused on unifying Nigeria to rise to its true potential as a world leader, and tackling poverty and unemployment through specific policies such as education reform, an innovation-led economy, and the creation of a public-private venture capital fund that will boost youth entrepreneurship and create new jobs.
