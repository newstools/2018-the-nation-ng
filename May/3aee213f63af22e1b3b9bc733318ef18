The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdul-Rasheed Adewale Akanbi, Telu I, has urged the Federal Government to review policies working against Nigeria’s unity. The first-class monarch said government policies emphasising citizens’ states of origin, restriction of political aspirations to Nigerians’ immediate environment and many others should be discouraged. Dressed in Igbo garment during installation of the first Asiwaju (leader) of the Igbo Assembly in Iwo, Emeka Martins Odumegwu, at the palace square, the Oluwo said peace and unity were major ingredients for building a virile and formidable nation in Africa. Oba Akanbi said his unifying efforts and several discussions with his northern, Southsouth and southeastern colleagues were designed to ensure oneness in Nigeria. According to him, emphasis on ethnicity has done the nation much damage. He said: “The palace is a rallying point and a haven for every Nigerian. It does not recognise political, religious, ethnic and economic bias. Everyone, irrespective of their location, should be able to approach any palace and make his request. The palace belongs to all Nigerians, not a certain ethnic class. “The traditional stereotype attached to the palace must be addressed. We owe it a duty to establish the purity of our respective palaces. Doing this will convince the populace that the palace has spiritual values. “Unlike the mosques and churches, where Muslims and Christians have exclusive access to, the palaces should accommodate everyone – whether you are Muslims or Christians, Yoruba, Hausa or Igbo. As fathers to the nation, we are left with no alternative than to make our palaces accessible to all Nigerians and be prompt at bringing intervention to issues affecting their wellbeing.”
