The beneficiaries of the N2.19 billion bonus shares include Seplat’s Chief Executive Officer, Austin Avuru; Chief Financial Officer, Roger Brown and Operations Director, Effiong Okon.  The shares were granted on May 2 under the company’s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP).

Brown received 760,046 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each and 55,673 deferred shares while Okon received 779,061 ordinary shares of 50 kobo each.

The three top management executives were granted a total of 2.98 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each, valued at N2.19 billion at Seplat’s opening price of N734.70 at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). Company Secretary, Seplat Petroleum Development Company Plc, Dr Mirian Kene Kachikwu stated that awards will vest on May 2, 2021 being the third anniversary of the award date subject to relative total shareholder return performance condition and reserves growth underpin. The company noted that in line with the approach approved by its remuneration committee, the number of ordinary shares to be granted was calculated by dividing the monetary value of the salary multiple relevant for each PDMR by the higher of the average share price over first quarter 2018 or £1. As the average share price over first quarter 2018 was £1.29, the calculation was performed based on the share price. Meanwhile, many deferred shares awarded was calculated by reference to Seplat’s closing share price on December 29, 2017 of £1.09. Under the Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by Seplat’s shareholders at its 2015 Annual General Meeting, 25 per cent of the directors’ yearly bonus paid for a financial year is deferred into an award over shares and the shares will normally be released on December 31, 2019 – two years following the end of the performance year in respect of which the award is made, subject to continued employment in line with the LTIP rules and corporate governance best practice. “No consideration was paid for the grant of these awards and no consideration is due on the vesting of awards,” Kachikwu stated. Last February, the Board of Directors of Seplat awarded 25 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each as bonus shares to its staff under the company’s LTIP. The supplementary listing of the 25 million ordinary shares of 50 kobo each at the NSE increased the company’s total issued and fully paid up shares to 588.445 million ordinary shares. Kachikwu stated that the distribution was in exercise of the powers granted to the board of the oil and gas company by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) held on June 30, 2014 to implement the initial public offering (IPO) award and other remuneration of the top management and directors as disclosed in the IPO prospectus. She stated that the 25 million shares were allotted to Stanbic IBTC Trustees Limited as custodian in furtherance of the company’s LTIP. Seplat had also in June 2017 some 11.43 million ordinary shares as bonus shares to its chairman, chief executive officer, executive directors and non executive directors of Seplat.
