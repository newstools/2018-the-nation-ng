Dr Rebecca Umaru, the Provost, College of Education Akwanga ( COEA ), has implored the Nasarawa State Government to increase funding for the institution. Umaru made this appeal on Monday when the House of Assembly Committee on Education paid a courtesy visit to the institution for an oversight function. The provost, represented by the Deputy Provost Administration, Mohammed Alhassan, said inadequate funding was hampering the smooth running of the college activities. Umaru added that all departments in the college had inadequate academic staff, saying,”we have a very big challenge of manpower in all our departments. “We also have challenges of promotion arrears, which we were unable to carry out due to insufficient funds,” he added. She also said that so many of their retired staff were not included in the pension list and their salaries were stopped immediately they retired from service. Umaru also said that the problem had become more serious now with the introduction of treasury single account in the state. She said that for any single thing that required money, the institution had to write to the office of the State’s Accountant-General for approval and release. Umaru, however, lauded Gov. Umaru Al-Makura for giving due attention to the college in infrastructure development among others. Responding, Daniel Ogazi, the House Committee Chairman on Education, assured the college management that the House would give urgent attention to all their challenges. NAN
