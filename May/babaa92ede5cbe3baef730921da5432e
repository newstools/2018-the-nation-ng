Lagos State Governor Akinwunmi Ambode yesterday approved the construction of a flyover at Fagba to ease traffic and reduce travel time on the Pen Cinema-Iju Road. He gave the approval after inspecting the ongoing construction of the Pen Cinema flyover, where he observed the need to holistically address traffic around Agege-Iju so as to make the bridge more effective. According to him, this is in response to the yearnings of the Fagba community and road users plying the axis. He added that it was also in furtherance of his administration’s commitment in ensuring free flow of traffic and reducing man-hour loss across the state. Ambode said: “Iju Road which is one of the major roads in Lagos State has over the years served as a strategic growth pole in the socio- economic landscape of the state; it has overgrown its present traffic carrying capacity resulting in the traffic challenges being experienced presently. “The proposed flyover at Fagba will be constructed concurrently with the ongoing Pen Cinema flyover and accelerated to minimise the inconvenience of the motoring and commuting public during the period of construction. “The bridge which will have a dual carriageway separated by concrete median barrier will allow seamless flow of traffic into Jonathan Coker for vehicular movement from College Road/Pen Cinema and vice versa for traffic from Jonathan Coker Road that are Iju or College Road bound.” The Governor said, on completion, the Fagba bridge would aid socio-economic activities, development and safety of road users.
