Osibanjo explained that the project will boost micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME-s) in the country. According to him, “We are focusing on major markets across the country to put an end to power problem. We are working at Ariria Market in Aba, likewise Sabongeri Market in Kano and we are focusing on markets in Lagos as well. We can see how excited the market women are judging by their testimonies. “This technology is new and it is remotely monitored from the headquarters of the service providers. If anyone attempts to tamper with the meter it would be detected from the monitoring centre immediately and necessary action would be taken.” Osinbajo who was accompanied by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, however, promised the market women that the project would be extended to all other markets.
