Ethiopian Airlines will take delivery of its 100th aircraft, a Boeing 787-900, on June 5. It is the first African airline to operate a 100-aircraft fleet, thus maintaining its aviation technology leadership role and ascertaining its position in all aspects of aviation services on the continent. Its Group CEO, Mr. Tewolde Gebre Mariam, said: “It is an immense honour for all of us at Ethiopian to reach the milestone of 100 aircraft. ‘’This milestone is a continuation of our historical aviation leadership role in Africa and a testimony of the successful implementation of our fast, profitable and sustainable growth plan, Vision 2025. Ethiopian was the first to avail jet service on the continent back in 1962, and operated the first African B767 in 1984, the first African B777-200LR in 2010, the first African B787-800 Dreamliner and B777-200 freighter in 2012 and the first African A350 in 2016 and the first African B787-9 aircraft in 2017. Ethiopian operates one of the youngest and most modern 100 aircraft, with an average age of less than five  years. Fleet modernisation and expansion is one of the four critical pillars of our Vision 2025 strategic roadmap, in support of our fast-expanding network, which has reached over 110 international destinations covering  five  continents. “Our new and cutting-edge fleet composed of B787s and A350s offer unparalleled on-board comfort to our customers and offer the best possible connections when traveling within Africa and between the continent and the rest of the world. ‘’This 100 fleet milestone, which we have achieved ahead of our Vision 2025 targets, compels us to revise our plans with a view to phase in more aircraft and further expand our network so as to meet the growing travel needs of our continent and support its economic development and integration by facilitating the flow of investment, trade and tourism.’’
