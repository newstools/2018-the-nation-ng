The Young Democratic Party (YDP) has asked the Federal High Court in Abuja to void the registration by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of Young Progressives Party (YPP), saying its name is similar to its own. The suit, with YDP and its Acting National Secretary, Iliyasu Mohammed Makaye (as plaintiffs), has INEC, its Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, YPP and it’s National Chairman, Bishop Emmanuel Amakiri as defendant. The plaintiffs alleged that INEC breached Section 82(2)(a)(b)(c) of the 2010 Electoral Act (as amended) by registering YPP with “a similar acronym with YDP,  being an existing political party.” They want the court to declare the registration of YPP by INEC as unlawful, void and of no legal effect for non-compliance with provisions of the 2010 Electoral Act as amended. The plaintiffs urged the court to declare that the act of  registering YPP by the INEC and Yakubu was deliberate and aimed at frustrating their progress. In a supporting affidavit deposed to by YDP’s National Deputy Organising Secretary South, Nwachi Francis Nnali, the plaintiffs stated that the 2nd defendant ( Amakiri) was once a National Youth leader under the umbrella of YDP and was suspended and subsequently expelled from the party for anti-party activities. They accused INEC of conniving with Amakiri in registering YPP and alleged that INEC is aware that the 2nd defendant was expelled from YDP, because INEC was formally notified of the development.
