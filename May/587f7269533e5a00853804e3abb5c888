Wema Bank Plc is taking some of its customers to Russia next month as part of its promo. The promo, which will reward a selected number of customers who have saved at least N100,000 in their Wema Savings or ALAT Accounts over 30 days with a trip to Russia, coincides with the FIFA World Cup season. “We are rewarding our customers who operate Savings Accounts and have saved N100,000 or more for at least 30 days, with a trip to Russia,” said Dotun Ifebogun, Head Retail and SME Banking at Wema Bank. “This promotion is our way of saying thank you to customers who have committed to saving. It is also a way of encouraging non-customers to start saving by opening a Wema Savings Account or ALAT Account as new customers who open an account and save a minimum of N100,000 for 30days will also be rewarded,” Ifebogun added. Wema Bank, which recently celebrated its 73rd anniversary and the first anniversary of its digital bank ALAT, is committed to encouraging savings. The bank has in the past supported events and campaigns that drive savings culture. The latest initiative is believed to encourage more people to save. “Savings helps people become financially secure and provide a safety net in case of an emergency,” stressed Funmilayo Falola, Head of Brand and Marketing Communications at Wema Bank Plc. “It gets even better when you are being rewarded for saving your money,” she added. The bank said it decided on sending its lucky customers to Russia because 2018 is the best year in recent times anyone could have gone to the world’s largest nation. Also, June is the month with the best weather most convenient for long hours of sightseeing and “ball-watching”.
