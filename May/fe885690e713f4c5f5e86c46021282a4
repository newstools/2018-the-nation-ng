The yearly Lagos State University Convocation Staff Games has begun to mark the institutionâ€™s 22nd convocation that would see 26,637 fresh graduates bid farewell to their alma mater. The sports meet introduced by the management led by its Vice Chancellor Prof Lanre Adigun Fagbohun, has been zoned into four: Ojo (main campus); Ikeja (College of Medicine); Badagry staff quarters/Joint University Preliminary Examination Board); as well as Epe (School of Agriculture/College of Engineering). Games, such as soccer (male only), athletics, badminton, table tennis, drought are part of the sport event. While workers in Epe will slug it out with their counterparts in Badagry, those in Ojo will flex muscles with their colleagues in Ikeja. Winners in each category will play the final tommorrow while the two losers will play for the second place. Trophies and medals will also be presented to winners tomorrow shortly before members of the university community will converge for Muslim Jumat Service at the university mosque, and Christian interdenominational service on Saturday. Earlier, Fagbohun said the contest, second of its kind, was introduced to foster friendship and harmony among workers. He boasted that the university could beat its chest on the quality of LASU graduating students who have been trained to bridge the gap via career development and Ready Set Work, an initiative of Lagos State Government. The 34-year-old institution will also, for the first time, have its anthem rendered in the auditorium.
