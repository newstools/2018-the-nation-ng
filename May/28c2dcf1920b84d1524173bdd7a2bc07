 *shifts attention to World cup  Super Eagles and Chelsea winger Victor Moses has given his teeming fans a pat on the back for supporting him and the Blues leading to the FA triumph on Saturday. The former Crystal Palace ace insisted that the Stamford Bridge landlords ended the season on a high despite failing in their bid to finish in the top four. Moses who has been given express permission by Coach Gernot Rohr to stay away from the friendly tie against Congo to enable him rest, said he is now ready to focus on the forth coming world cup in Russia. “Just want to say a huge thanks to all the fans who have supported me and the team this season at @ChelseaFC . Glad we could end it on a high for you on Saturday! Time now to focus on the World Cup and a big few weeks ahead with Nigeria,” he said  even as he dished out group picture of the Blues celebrating their triumph as 2018 FA Cup winners. The 27 year old is sure to be in action when the Eagles file out against Three lions at the wembley on June 2nd. Moses who has made over 29 appearances for the Super Eagles with 11 goals to his credit contributed in no small measure to the Nation’s qualification for the world cup. He ranks among African players being tipped to make a difference in Russia. Also included in that list is Mohammed Salah who scored 32 goals for Liverpool this season successfully pushing the Reds to a top four finish.. Five countries Nigeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Senegal and Morocco will represent Africa at this year’s world cup to be played in 11 Russian cities beginning from June 14.
