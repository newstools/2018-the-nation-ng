The resolutions were sequel to a motion on “The Twin Bomb Blast in Mubi and the need for Immediate Action to Prevent Recurrence” by Sen. Binta Garba (APC-Adamawa) at plenary. Binta noted that on May 1, “two suspected suicide bombers shattered the relative peace in Mubi and environs through a twin bomb explosion in a mosque.” The lawmaker said the recent attacks had seriously brought back fears, not only in Mubi but also the entire Adamawa North Senatorial District. “This will definitely affect businesses of the aream, especially Mubi, being a centre of the state.

After a Voice Vote by the President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki, the prayers of the motion were unanimously adopted by the senators.
