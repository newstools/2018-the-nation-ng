The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW), a leader in the global accounting and finance industry, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to strengthen the accountancy profession in Nigeria. Both organisations have committed to work together to promote a sound and sustainable accounting and finance industry by sharing their knowledge, improving professional and intellectual development and advancing the number of members of accountancy bodies. The agreement was signed by ICAEW President Nick Parker and ICAN President Alhaji Isma’ila Muhammadu Zakari, during an official ceremony in Lagos. Speaking on the MoU, Alhaji Zakari said: “A strong financial sector is the backbone of any economy; so we look forward to working closely with ICAEW in future to develop a number of exciting initiatives and to share experiences and expertise for the benefit of the profession in Nigeria. It is essential to establish linkages of this nature so that both bodies will be able to leverage upon each other’s strengths.” Parker also said: “We are pleased to sign a mutually beneficial alliance with ICAN and are looking forward to aligning our visions and sharing our expertise to strengthen and support the development of the accountancy profession in Nigeria.”
