Premier League campaigners Huddersfield are reportedly ready to sign Super Eagles’ defender Leon Balogun at the end of the ongoing Premier League season. They are currently battling to escape relegation as they now occupy the 16th position on the table, but the club is said to be interested in signing Balogun regardless of where they play next term. The contract of Balogun who currently plays for German club FSC Mainz 05, will expire at the end of the season, and the 29-year-old defender will become a free agent. According to the report by UK Sun, Huddersfield’s chiefs and Balogun have discussed the possibility of the Nigeria international joining the club. After his contract with Bundesliga side Fortuna Düsseldorf had expired in summer 2014, he was without a club for three months until he joined Darmstadt 98. He signed a contract until the end of the 2014–15 season. Leon Balogun who was born to a Nigerian father and a German mother, was called up by Nigeria for a March 2014 friendly against Mexico, as a replacement for ex-Super Eagles’ captain Joseph Yobo. And since then, he has been an essential member of the current Super Eagles squad, and he is expected to be in Russia for the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
