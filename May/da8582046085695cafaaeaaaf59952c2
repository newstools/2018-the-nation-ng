A Federal High Court sitting in Abuja on Monday issued a bench warrant for the arrest of a former investigator with the Special Presidential Investigation Panel for the Recovery of Public Property (SPIPRPP), Victor Osita Uwajeh. Justice John Tsoho issued the bench warrant while ruling on an application filed by Kayode Alilu, a lawyer for the Office of the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF), following Uwajeh’s failure to appear in court for his trial. The office of the AGF has since September 19, 2017 filed a four-count charge marked: FHC/ABJ/CR/148/2017, in which Uwajeh was said to have “utter a false document” with which he allegedly claimed to be acting as agent of Senator Emmanuel Andy Uba. Uwajeh was recently sacked by SPIPRPP as special investigator on April 23. In the letter with reference number SPIP/LR/2018/Vol. 1/29, SPIPRPP said it sacked Uwajeh due to his alleged non-disclosure of a criminal charge pending against him before the Federal High Court in Abuja. At the commencement of proceedings on Monday, Alilu told the court that the prosecution has executed the court’s order for substituted service of criminal summons on the defendant.
