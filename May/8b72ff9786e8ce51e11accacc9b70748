An Assistant Superintendent of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Peter Innocent Abu, has been found dead in his home at Aduwawa in Edo State. Some neighbours alleged that he committed suicide, while others claimed he was strangled by unidentified persons. An NSCDC official, who pleaded anonymity, denied that Abu committed suicide or was killed. He said policemen and NSCDC officials, who broke into his room, found him dead. The official said the deceased might have died in his sleep. He said: “The deceased slept and did not wake up. It was the police and our personnel who opened the door of his room. There was no sign of suicide or attack. “The police are investigating the incident. He was not strangled as being speculated.”
