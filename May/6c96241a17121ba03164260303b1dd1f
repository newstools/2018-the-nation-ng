Homeowners’ Charter Programme has improved the physical and social infrastructure as well as  value of properties in Ogun State, Governor Ibikunle Amosun said. Amosun stated this during the 31st edition of the presentation of Certificates of Occupancy and Building Plan Approval to another batch of beneficiaries, at the Arcade Ground, Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta. Represented by Commissioner for Health Dr. Babatunde Ipaye, the Governor said, findings show that that value of landed property had increased, just as land owners now build with confidence as a result of availability of land title documents. “With the C of O, there is a significant improvement on our physical infrastructure and the value of houses skyrocket from the day you have the document. “Also, when you know that you are the true owner of your house, it gives you confidence’’, Amosun said. He observed that those who did not believe in the programme are beginning to see that the administration meant business, calling for continued support of government policies and programmes to  fulfil promises made to the people. The Homeowners’ Charter Programme Analyst, Mr. Adetayo Oni, said the government was determined to offer continuous and efficient services to all qualified applicants, urging beneficiaries to spread the good news about the programme. Speaking on behalf of the beneficiaries, Mr. Sola Adegbenro from Ifo Local Government Area, thanked the government for keeping to its words, saying the documents had made them confident owners of their property.
