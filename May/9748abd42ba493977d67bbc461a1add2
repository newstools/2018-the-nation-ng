 The National Industrial Court has taken over mediation in the dispute between the Federal Ministry of Health and striking Health workers under the auspices of the Joint Health Sector Unions with a view to ensuring an amicable settlement of the dispute. The Presiding Judge of the court, however asked the striking health workers to first go and obey the earlier ruling of the court by returning to work, while the process of mediation will resume. However, JOHESU has asked the court to give it till Friday, June 1, 2018 to met with their members and inform them of the decision of the court. An NGO, the Incorporated Trustees of the Kingdom Human Rights Foundation, KHRFI, had obtained a court order against JOHESU; mandating the health workers to suspend their industrial action on the 21st of May, 2018. The NGO had also filed a contempt proceeding against JOHESU which was to be decided on Wednesday, but the judge ruled that in the interest of the suffering Nigerian masses who need medical services, he would refer the case to the Alternative Dispute Resolution division of the court to mediate. He directed that the Minister of Labour and Employment and the Minister of Health should appoint representation to the ADR team who will mediate and ensure an amicable resolution. At the time of this report, the leadership of JOHESU were meeting to decide on the next line of action, but there are indications that the ongoing strike may be suspended to give the National Industrial Court the chance to mediate.
