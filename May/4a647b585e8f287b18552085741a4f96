 Liverpool’s’ Captain fantastic’, Steven Gerrard, has been appointed Rangers’ manager ,on a four- year contract. The ex-England midfielder will take over for next season after he was confirmed on Friday as the man tasked with breaking Celtic’s domination in Scotland. Though he has no senior managerial experience, the Ibrox outfit have turned to Gerrard in the hope his high profile and extensive contacts can help the club compete against their Glasgow neighbours.  Rangers look set to finish third for a second successive season having struggled to challenge rivals Celtic since returning to the top flight in 2016, including losing four of the five Old Firm derbies this term. The last of those was a humiliating 5-0 hammering that led to Graeme Murty’s dismissal and paved the way for Gerrard’s appointment, which sees the 37-year-old – who previously turned down an opportunity at MK Dons – leave his role as a coach at Liverpool’s academy. Gerrard said: “I am honoured to become the next manager of Rangers. I have enormous respect for this football club, and its history and tradition. “I can’t wait to start this new journey at Rangers as we look to build on the many successes that this club has achieved.” Chairman Dave King added: “We are delighted to confirm today that Steven Gerrard will become the next manager of Rangers. “From the very beginning, talks have been extremely positive and we believe that Steven is the right man to drive Rangers forward. “He was extremely impressive throughout our negotiations and we are convinced that he has the necessary knowledge and temperament to lead the Club to the success we all desire. “This is a special day for our Club, our fans and for Steven.”
