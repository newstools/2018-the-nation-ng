Excitement ahead of next month’s prestigious international friendly between Nigeria and England’s ‘A’ teams, began to build up on Thursday after the President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Mr Amaju Pinnick and the Second Vice President, Mallam Shehu Dikko met with the British High Commissioner to Nigeria, Paul Arkwright. Arkwright received the NFF chieftains at the British High Commission in the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and used the opportunity to inform the Federation that the High Commission will organise some events around the match both in the United Kingdom and Nigeria. “Let me also assure you that England is taking this match very seriously. It is more than just a game; it is a big preparatory game towards the FIFA World Cup. More than that, the historical ties between our two countries are there to be considered, so it will also serve to strengthen and enhance relations and good collaboration between our countries,” said Arkwright. Pinnick told Arkwright that the Nigerian High Commission in the United Kingdom is also involved in effort to ensure the match is a huge success, coming less than two weeks before the opening match of the Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup finals. “We appreciate the excellent and cordial relations between our two countries and that is one of the reasons this is more than just a match. It is coming up only two weeks before Nigeria’s first match at the FIFA World Cup, and 16 days before England’s first match in Russia. Ours are two countries that have so much in common. We believe this match will go a long way in strengthening England-Nigeria relations in several areas.” Also present at the meeting was Louise Edwards, who is Second Secretary, Political Secretary of the British High Commission in Nigeria. The Super Eagles and the Three Lions will lock horns at the Wembley Stadium on Saturday, 2nd June, in what will be the Eagles’ penultimate friendly match before flying to the World Cup finals in Russia.
