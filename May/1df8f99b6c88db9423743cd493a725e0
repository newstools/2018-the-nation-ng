•Sells state as film, tourism destination Save for a midday sower that sets Cannes and neighboring town freezing on Sunday, film enthusiasts and tourists at the ongoing Cannes International Film Festival, South of France, have enjoyed the feel of summer. A delegation from Lagos State, consisting celebrities, tourism officials and Journalists are among them. Of the plethora of activities at the international event, Nigeria is not lost in the crowd, as Lagos State hoists the nation’s flag at Pavilion 210, at the Pantiero-Side of the International Film Village. In the midst of the usual networking among filmmakers around the world, the Lagos State Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture launched its first major activity on Friday, with the official unveiling of the second edition of the ‘Cinema in Lagos’ journal, a publication that provides deep insights into the tourism character of Lagos State with cinema business as a peg. The attraction to pavilion 210 was exceptional, going by the star power celebrity politician, Hon. Desmond Elliot and rave filmmaker, Kunle Afolayan who are among the Lagos State delegation at the festival. The unveiling ceremony of the 80-page magazine was helmed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Tourism, Arts and Culture, Mr. Fola Adeyemi, who conveyed the warm wishes of the State Governor, Mr. Akinwumi Ambode. Boasting of Lagos as Nigeria’s captivating city, Adeyemi laid emphasis on the natural beaches and sceneries in the state as some of the locations suitable for world class productions. Corroborating Adeyemi, Elliot spoke of a government that is not only a lover of the arts but of top hospitality and tourism verve. “If you have not been to Lagos, you have not tasted Africa,” he said. This was just as Afolayan reiterated the commitment of the state government to the growth of motion picture industry, urging filmmakers across the world to come to Lagos for creative businesses.
