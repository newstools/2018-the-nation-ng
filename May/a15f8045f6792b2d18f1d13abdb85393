Super Eagles’ Technical Adviser Gernot Rohr has said that he will submit his 30-man provisional list to World footballing governing, body FIFA on Monday, while hinting that the same players may prosecute the Eagles friendlies against Democratic Republic of Congo on May 28 and England on June 2. The Franco-German football tactician is also expected to name new players in the team that will battle DR Congo and England. But he told NationSport from his base in France that, “I am going to announce the list of 30 players that will play against DR Congo on May 28 in Port Harcourt and on June 2 against England.” He also assured that Super Eagles fans and Nigerians won’t be disappointed with the choice of players he has invited to prosecute the two matches. “Nigerians will be happy with the players that we have invited for the matches. I can also assure you that they will give their best against DR Congo and England”, Rohr stated. The coach also praised Leicester City’s forward Kelechi Iheanacho for his Man of The Match performance in Wednesday’s 3-1 defeat of Arsenal in the Week 37 of the English Premier League. “I am happy about the good form of Kelechi. He really played well against Arsenal. That’s the kind of form we expect from our players before the World Cup. He also said that he would wait for the outcome of this weekend’s matches across Europe before finally submitting his provisional list to FIFA. “I am also waiting for the next round of matches before submitting my list to FIFA on Monday,” Rohr disclosed.
