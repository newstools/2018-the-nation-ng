All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship aspirants in Ekiti State Senator Gbenga Aluko and Dr. Oluwole Oluleye have denied withdrawing from the race. Aluko described the report that he had stepped down for a particular aspirant as “false and far from the truth.” He said in a statement by his campaign organisation in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital, that he will win the primary. Aluko, who described himself as a “front runner in the race,” alleged that a certain aspirant was behind the false information. According to the campaign group,  “Senator Gbenga Aluko was in the Senate 19 years ago as a principal officer and has no plan whatsoever of contesting as a Senator again. “He is running a revolutionary campaign to become Governor of Ekiti State to liberate the people of the state on the platform of the APC, and he is a frontrunner in the contest. “We implore the general public, especially APC delegates, in the May 5 primary election to ignore any information on social media, radio, TV, and any other form of mass communication against the person of Senator Aluko.” Also, Oluleye denied withdrawing for former governor and APC Deputy National Chairman (South), Chief Segun Oni. Oluleye said in a statement by the Director-General of his campaign organization, Chief Dele Olatuyi, he will pursue his ambition to the end. Olatuyi said: “News going round on the social media that Dr Oluwole Oluleye, one of the aspirants that has already scaled through the governorship screening conducted by APC. has stepped down for Engineer Segun Oni. “The news is not true, but a false and complete lie and product of the imagination of rumour mongers. Dr. Oluwole Oluleye is still in the governorship race of the APC in Ekiti State.”
