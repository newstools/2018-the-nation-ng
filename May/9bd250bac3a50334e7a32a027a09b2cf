A group in Cross River State has commended the Ministry of Niger Delta as well as the Minister, Pastor Usani Usani, for various interventions in the state. Director General of the group, known as Friends of Usani Usani, Mr Charles Ntiero, said the state has never had it so good, in the entire 16 years the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was in power. Ntiero said the achievement of the Ministry in the state since 2016 has cut across construction of roads, erosion control, housing, electricity, water and sanitation, shoreline protection and land reclamation, food processing and economic empowerment. “The projects and empowerments for the people he has done in the state are so enormous and we are grateful to see them. We have been monitoring the projects in the state and seen the quality of materials, especially the Atimbo Road that really concerns me. I have discovered that businesses in Akpabuyo and Bakassi axis had been dying because of that bad road. In fact, there was a special market we had called Ekpri Urua Ikang. That market was dead because of access road, but today that market has come back to life. The commuters are also happy,” Ntiero said. He said their objectives included enlightening Cross Riverians on what the Minister was doing in the state and encourage him to do more. “We advocate peace and unity for Cross Riverians, and also target 2019 general for the success of APC in the state,” he said.
