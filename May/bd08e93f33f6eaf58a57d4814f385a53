The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Prince Uche Secondus, and Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu have congratulated the party for holding a credible primary. Secondus said the hitch free and transparent primary was a consequence of the party’s rebranding and repositioning project. Secondus said the real winner is democracy and not any individual, adding that the PDP family in Ekiti would be healthier after the primary. In a congratulatory message  to Governor Ayodele Fayose and other leaders and members of PDP in Ekiti State after the primary, the chairman charged them to note the pre- primary understanding that there will be no winner or loser. In a statement by  Ike Abonyi, Secondus commended those who made the primary a success, particularly Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and his team. He also commended Prince Dayo Adeyeye for not only accepting the result, but commending the process as free, fair and credible. Secondus assured members and supporters of the party that the era of impunity and imposition of candidates in the party is gone. He charged members of the party desiring to fly the flag of the party at any level to return to the grassroots and market themselves because in a rebranded PDP, ticket is not given in party offices, but by the people on the field. The PDP leader warned the APC  not to create any nuisance in their frustration ahead of the July election as available intelligence shows that the opposition is trying to disrupt the peaceful election. Secondus urged PDP members to remain vigilant and not relent until the final success is achieved in July. Deputy Senate President Ike Ekweremadu also congratulated the Ekiti State chapter of the PDP, for the peaceful primary that produced  Prof. Kolapo Olusola, as the governorship candidate. He empahsised that more important than the result was the process, noting that the PDP had, once more, showcased the growing internal democracy in the party.
