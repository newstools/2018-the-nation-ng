Leveraging on the huge attention a retinue of bikers would garner, a group of artistes are embarking on a public campaign on the power of PVC in determining desired leadership. An initiative of BKleff Entertainment, headed by Balogun Akorede, the campaign tagged ‘Power of PVC Ride’ will have celebrities and bikers converge on Saturday May 5, 2018, at the Gani Fawehinmi Freedom Park from where they will touch venues like  Ojota Park, University of Lagos, and INEC Office, Yaba, Lagos to submit the ‘Power of PVC Ride Official Letter’. The group will then proceed to Ogun State enroute BABCOCK University, Ogun State University, TASUED and then to the Confluence Hotel in Ijebu-Ode where they will round off the campaign. The movement, according to Balogun, is supported by bikers all over Nigeria and the Diaspora. “The movement is not aimed at promoting any party but solely aimed at Nigerians at large hence the partnership with INEC to see Nigerians come out énmass to vote come 2019. “ Continuing, Balogun said: “INEC has assured Nigerians of credible conclusive elections in 2019 but this requires the cooperation and support of critical stakeholders of which, voters are parts of.  Nigerian citizens can help in advancing the electoral process by ensuring that they get registered. So get registered, collect your PVCs, safeguard them and use them wisely during election as they constitute the necessary requirement to participate in the electoral process.” He noted that the awareness rally will have in attendance “Power BIKERS, lovers of Power Bikes, Celebrities, Actors, Artistes and other well-meaning Nigerians etc. We wish to say that the Area Father (Charly Boy) will be part of the Awareness Rally come May 5, 2018.” This he said is ahead of a nationwide rally tagged 36 + FCT PVC RIDE CAMPAIGN where bikers all over the country will participate.
