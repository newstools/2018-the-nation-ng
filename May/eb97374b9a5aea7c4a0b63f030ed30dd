Enugu State has equipped 150 schools with Information Communication Technology (ICT)  tools, to encourage use of computers, Post-Primary School  Management Board (PPSMB) Chairman Nestor Ezema has said. He spoke in Enugu when the House Committee on Education visited the board. Ezema said the board equipped the schools, mostly in rural areas, in line with the government’s zero tolerance for exam malpractices. He said the difference between the child in private or public schools was about equipment and usage. The chairman said the government was recruiting 2,000 teachers in batches. He said 1,000 were already in place.  Ezema said the state would no longer lack teachers, especially in rural areas, after the  exercise. He noted that the board banned inter-zonal transfer to stop those teachers influencing transfer from rural areas. Ezema said the government trained 11,000 teachers to update them on modern teaching. Chairman, House Committee on Education, Mr. Matthew Ugwueze, said the visit was to identify challenges facing the board and how to tackle them. He decried the rising land encroachment in schools. Ugwueze urged public companies and financial institutions to partner the government in building and renovating schools.
