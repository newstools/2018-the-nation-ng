independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) Acting Chairman Dr. Musa Usman Abubakar has accused lawyers of glorifying corruption rather than joining the fight against it. He said some lawyers serve as mouthpieces to those accused of corruption contrary to the Rules of Professional Conduct for Legal Practitioners. Abubakar said it was “disheartening” that such lawyers have become clogs in the wheel of justice. He backed calls for the establishment of a special anti-corruption court, but said it would not solve the problem of delays if lawyers do not change their attitude. The ICPC chief spoke at the Fifth Criminal Justice Reform Conference in Asaba, the Delta State capital. It was organised by the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) Criminal Justice Reform Committee chaired by Chief Arthur Obi Okafor (SAN). Abubakar said: “In as much as the ICPC subscribes to the establishment of special court, I make bold to say that there would hardly be any difference if the defense lawyers maintain their usual tactics of frustrating the smooth administration of justice.”
