Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc, one of Nigeria’s oldest surviving financial institutions, yesterday announced its audited report for the 2017 business year and interim report and accounts for the first quarter of this year, showing considerable growth in key performance indicators. Key extracts of the three-month report for the period ended March 31, 2018 showed that the bank recorded double-digit growths in the top-line and the bottom-line, raising hopes for better returns in the 2018 business year. Gross earnings rose by 15 per cent while profits before and after tax grew by 16 per cent and 17 per cent respectively. The reports, released to the investing public at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) yesterday, showed a steady growth trajectory over the 13-month period, with the bank building on its performance in 2017 in the first quarter of 2018. The three-month first quarter 2018 report showed gross earnings of N39.5 billion in first quarter 2018 as against N34.3 billion in first quarter 2017. Profit before tax rose from N4.7 billion in first quarter 2017 to N5.4 billion in first quarter 2018. Profit after tax also increased to N5.3 billion in first quarter 2018 compared with N4.5 billion recorded in comparable period of 2017. Chief Executive Officer, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc, Mr. Emeka Emuwa, said the first quarter results reflected the bank’s renewed focus on driving efficiency and productivity with a view to fully leveraging resources including human, technology and new capital to maximize the bottom line. “While we are just in the early stages of this drive, we are already starting to see positive results,” Emuwa said. Audited report for the year ended December 31, 2017 showed that gross earnings rose by 26 per cent from N126.6 billion in 2016 to N163.8 billion in 2017. Profit before tax was largely flat at N15.5 billion in 2017 as against N15.7 billion in 2016. Emuwa noted that the group’s non-performing loan ratio had improved to 14.9 percent by March 2018 from 19.8 percent at the beginning of this year, noting that the bank has continued to maintain aggressive focus on its impaired loans and is expected to resolve some large exposures in the course of the year, which will further drive down the ratio. “For the first half of the year, we will continue to hone initiatives around our productivity drive, focusing our people on targeted opportunities across regions and optimising our technology and digital platforms to deliver operational efficiency and improved customer service,” Emuwa said. Chief Financial Officer, Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN) Plc, Oyinkan Adewale said while the first quarter results reflected the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) 9, which came into effect at the start of 2018, the bank’s regulatory risk reserve was adequate to absorb the impact of the new accounting rules. “Our capital adequacy ratio (CAR) remains robust at 17.9 per cent in spite of the impact of IFRS 9 on impairments. Liquidity ratio is at 39.4 per cent, well above the minimum requirement, while net interest margin improved to 8.73 per cent in first quarter 2018 from 7.14 per cent in first quarter 2017,” Adewale said.
