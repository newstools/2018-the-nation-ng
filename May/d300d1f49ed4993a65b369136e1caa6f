Large enough to accommodate all Nigerian youths looking for means of livelihood. “All we need to do is to organize massive training for any willing youths, which we are already doing, and given the needed funds, we have plans to provide soft loans to filmmakers and also offer technical assistance to filmmakers to excel in the industry. “With NFC, there should be no jobless youth in the country, I’m pleased to inform Nigerians that very soon the Corporation will become a Commission and that will lead to improve funding. Already the enabling laws to that effect have been passed by the National Assembly. And the bill passed by both arms of the National Assembly is been harmonized, then it will be ready for the ascent of President Muhammadu Buhari. “We have plans to acquire state of the art equipment to enable filmmakers in the country produce film of global standard, we want to be the best filmmakers in the whole world, not only in Africa, everything possible to make us achieve that plan is top gear. “Above all, the board is working round the clock to ensure the Corporation move to its permanent secretariat, located at Laminga in Jos soon to enable us reposition the industry in a manner for it to reach its full potentials and achieve its set objectives.”
