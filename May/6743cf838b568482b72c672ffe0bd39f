RIVERS State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Chief Davies Ikanya has urged Governor Nyesom Wike to stop interfering in the affairs of the party. He also urged Wike to stop  insulting President Muhammadu Buhari. Ikanya, yesterday in Port Harcourt, warned that Wike should not take the President’s silence on his uncouth remarks as weakness. He wondered what is giving Wike the courage to boast that he will fight Buhari to a standstill, and that if the President dares touch him, Nigeria will collapse. Ikanya, through his Public Affairs consultant, Chief Eze Chukwuemeka Eze, noted that the utterances of Wike on Nigeria are those of a drowning man, after allegedly participating in looting the nation with impunity. He, however, said his clownish nature would not stop the judgement day fast approaching. He urged the governor to face governance, if he still has anything to offer. “Why will Wike be meddling in the affairs of APC in Rivers State, instead of busying himself with how to retire from the Government House, Port Harcourt, and what will be his fate after 2019 general election?”
