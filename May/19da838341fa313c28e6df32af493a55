Brighton & Hove Albion has made certain of another season of Premier League football thanks to a famous 1-0 victory over a below-par Manchester United at the Amex Stadium. The Seagulls moved up to 40 points for the campaign thanks to Pascal Gross’s header shortly before the hour mark, awarded thanks to goal-line technology. United barely registered an attempt all evening and were deservedly on the end of a seventh league defeat of the season, meaning that they have not yet secured second place with two games to play. The early signs were promising for United, as Marcus Rashford won his side a free kick in a promising position and sent it into a dangerous area for Marouane Fellaini to convert, only for the Belgian midfielder to rightly be flagged for offside. From that point on the Red Devils barely put together a fluid attacking move in the first half, as a side showing six changes from last time out struggled to keep their foot on the ball. Brighton arguably did enough to take a lead into the half-time interval, with both Pascal Gross and Jose Izquierdo being denied with long-range efforts, while Dale Stephens dragged one wide from a similar range. The Seagulls’ best effort came via returning striker Glenn Murray, whose half-volley was dipping towards the bottom corner if not for the intervention of De Gea to get across.
