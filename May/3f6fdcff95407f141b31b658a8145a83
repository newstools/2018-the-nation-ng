HOUSE of Representatives Speaker Yakubu Dogara has told heads of security agencies involved in the case of Senator Dino Melaye to ensure his safety. He said nothing untoward must happen to the lawmaker. According to him, they will be held responsible if anything happened to him. The Speaker said the health of persons should supersede their arraignment in court. He said: “All I can say is that nothing must happen to the senator. If anyone in this country commits an offence, the law is there for the person to be prosecuted or arraigned in court within the ambit of the law. “I don’t think the law supports a situation whereby someone is in a dire health situation and is being arraigned, most especially that person is a senator. “It is unthinkable that a distinguished senator or an honourable member of this House would run away from trial. “So, my admonition to the security agencies is to do everything possible to ensure that his life is secured first before prosecution.” Dogara’s warning followed a point of order by Sunday Karimi (PDP, Kogi), who said Melaye was being transported in an ambulance to Lokoja to face trial despite the state of his health. Karimi said Melaye’s predicament was as a result of his resolve to fight for his belief.
