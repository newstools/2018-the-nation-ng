Justice Nasir Ajanah, of the Kogi State High Court in Lokoja, has fixed May 16 to rule on Senator Dino Melaye’s bail application. Justice Ajanah gave the ruling after hearing arguments from Melaye’s lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN), and the lead prosecutor, Alex Iziyon (SAN). The two applications were consolidated. Ozekhome, who moved the application for bail, described the motion for variation by the prosecution as uncalled for, arguing that the judge cannot not reverse himself on the matter. “Since the trial judge had already ruled according to Section 166 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Law…the section did not say the court should vary an order it earlier made,” he argued. Ozekhome noted that the prosecution failed to appeal the ruling of the court that Melaye be taken back to National Hospital, Abuja.
