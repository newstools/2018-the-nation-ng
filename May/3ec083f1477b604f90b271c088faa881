State Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party, Chief Dan Orbih, has said that the one night he and other spent in Benin Prison has elevated their status to African statesmen. Chief Orbih, Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu, a former Deputy Governor, Mr. Lucky Imasuen, a former member of the House of Representatives, Tony Azegbemi and Efe Anthony spent last Thursday night in prison custody after they could not meet the bail conditions set by Justice P.I Adjokwu. They were arraigned on eight count charges of laundering the sum of N700m in 2015. The money was believed to be part the $115m Allison Diezani pilfered from the treasury to fund the 2015 general elections. They were released from custody at about 10:30pm on Friday night. Addressing party supporters who paid him solidarity at his residence, Chief Orbih said people who were sentenced to long years imprisonment later came out to rule the country. Chief Orbih vowed to continue to advance the course of the common man. According to him, “For the first time in the history of our state, documents that were not signed during the day were signed at9:30pm. The documents of Pastor Ize-Iyamu were declared missing. “They did not sign his papers because they wanted him to stay for the weekend. You can plan evil but evil will be defeated. “When you see any government using organs of government to oppress and intimidate opposition, you will know the end of that government is near.”
