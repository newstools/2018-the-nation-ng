A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ifo/Ewekoro Federal Constituency of Ogun State, Mr. Bolaji Akinola, has called for the establishment of Staple Crop Processing Centres (SCPC) and cold chain solution for farmers in the state. Speaking in company of some party faithful at Itori in Ewekoro Local Government Area, Akinola said SCPCs would reduce wastages of agricultural produce, increase internally generated revenue (IGR) and create jobs for youths. He said: “Ogun State is well positioned to lead the drive for diversification of Nigeria’s economy and reduce our overdependence on oil revenue. However, it is no longer the vogue to export raw materials or agricultural produce. The way to wealth is value addition. The Staple Crop Processing Centres will help farmers to add value to their produce before they are taken to the market. “The centres will also reduce wastages and seasonality of these crops. For instance, during rainy season, we see an abundance of certain crops, but they suddenly disappear after the season. The SCPCs will help to put an end to this development.” Akinola, who is also a maritime expert, said Nigeria must de-emphasise the exportation of raw agricultural produce, adding that “this does not help the national economy”. He said: “The wealth is in the hands of those who add value to crops and to raw materials. For instance, Africa exports 70 per cent of the world’s cocoa; yet, it derives less than five per cent of the $120 billion global cocoa gross domestic Product (GDP). This is because it barely adds value to its cocoa before exporting. “In the same vein, Africa exports about 50 per cent of the world gold but accounts for less than three per cent of the gold GDP for the same reason. Only those who add value to commodities derive wealth from it.”
