A 27-year-old man, Uber driver, James Ejemba, was on Wednesday brought before an Ikeja Magistrates’ Court for allegedly absconding with his employer’s Toyota Corolla car valued at N2million. Ejemba, whose address was not provided, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The Police Prosecutor, Insp. Benson Emuerhi, told the court that the accused committed the offences with some other persons still at large on Feb. 14 at Ile-Zik Bus Stop, Ikeja, Lagos. He alleged that the accused stole the car with registration No. SMK 694 EU belonging to one Mrs Ngozi Ireoha. Emuerhi said the accused however claimed that the car was stolen by four men who robbed him at gun point along Oshodi Expressway.
“He said he was attacked, but he failed to report the case to the police until he was arrested,’’ he said. The offences contravened Sections 287 and 411 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015 (Revised). Section 287 stipulates a three-year imprisonment for stealing. The accused, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge. In her ruling, the Chief Magistrate, Mrs O. Sule Amzat, granted the accused bail in the sum of N200, 000 with two responsible sureties in like sum and adjourned the case until July 2. NAN
