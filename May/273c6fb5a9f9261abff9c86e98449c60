Founder, Synagogue Church of All Nation (SCOAN), Prophet Temitope Joshua,  last Sunday hosted the church’s children department to a lavish party to mark the World Children’s Day. The kids, decked in beautiful attires, surrounded the founder, who led the dance session amid sonorous music rendered by the church choir. It was a spectacle to behold as the children also engaged him in a dance contest to the applause of the congregation. Prophet Joshua presented gifts to the children, urging them to take over their world. “As a prophet of God, I prophesy into you to take over your world and flourish as tomorrow’s leaders,” the cleric said, adding: “We must accord them (children) their due respect as it is their day. Here (SCOAN) it is our tradition to give special attention to children and we shall not stop.” He continued: “I have to rejoice with them. You have to rejoice with those rejoicing, if you fail, your day of rejoicing, will be delayed. As leaders of tomorrow, we congratulate these children and others in Nigeria and all over the world. It is well with you.”
