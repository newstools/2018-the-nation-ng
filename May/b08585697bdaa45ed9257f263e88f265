KIMI RAIKKONEN has hit back at rumours that he may leave Ferrari at the end of the season. The 38-year-old is in the final 12 months of his contract and speculation is rife that he is considering retiring. The 2007 world champion has had an illustrious career but is no longer considered to be on the same level as the likes of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel. Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo has been linked with a move to the Formula One heavyweights, should he not be given a car to compete for a world championship next term. “It’s been the same story every year since I can remember, maybe 15 years, every year I’m out,” Raikkonen said. “I’ll do my stuff on my side. I enjoy the racing, that’s the only reason I’m here. The rest, we’ll see how it plays out. In the team we know what we want to do and if all those things fit together with all our feeling we’ll see what happens.Right now all I want to do is well it’s a long season and a long way until the end of the year.” Raikkonen has made a decent start to the 2018 season with three podium finishes. And his team-mate Vettel would be happy to see him stick around for another year. “We’re a good pair, a good match. There’s no problem at all between us, ever,” Vettel told Motorsport.com last week.I think that’s a really big bonus for the team and for us to just enjoy our job. It’s been incredibly close this year so far. “To be honest, most of the Fridays I think he had the upper hand so far. Here and there I was struggling to understand the car and feel the car. Knowing him, knowing his strength, he’s incredibly talented and able to drive around problems.”
