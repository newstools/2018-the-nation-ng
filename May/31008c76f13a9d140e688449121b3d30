ONE-TIME Federal Commissioner for Works and Housing, Femi Okunnu, SAN will not want visitors’ interference at a particular period, not because he is hostile. But we can tell you for free that don’t bother to visit the octogenarian if he is watching football, especially when Arsenal is playing. The senior citizen, we gathered is a die –hard fan of the football club   and has not missed Arsenal matches since 1952 despite all the fact that the club has not been winning its games. Any visitors who come during such period will not be welcome.
