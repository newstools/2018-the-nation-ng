A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State, Senator Magnus Abe, has stated that President Muhammadu Buhari’s dogged fight against corruption in Nigeria and his insistence on transparency in governance are laudable. He also congratulated President Buhari on the third anniversary of his administration and the leadership of both chambers of the National Assembly and other Nigerians, as the country marked this year’s Democracy Day. Abe, who represents Rivers Southeast Senatorial District, on Tuesday in a statement by his Spokesperson, Parry Benson, commended President Buhari for his efforts so far in ensuring the full clean-up of impacted Ogoni environment. He also praised the President for the commencement of the Bonny-Bodo Road project in Rivers state and the ongoing reconstruction of the East-West Road, which when completed would ameliorate the plight of the people of Rivers and other states in the Niger Delta. Abe, a former Secretary to the Rivers State Government (SSG), assured the APC-led Federal Government of the continued support of the people of Rivers Southeast senatorial district and Rivers state in general to the people-oriented policies and programmes of the Buhari-led administration.
