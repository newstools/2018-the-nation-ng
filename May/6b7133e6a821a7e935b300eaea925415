The Ogun State Sector Commander of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Clement Oladele, is worried about the rising rate of loading agricultural produce on petrol tankers. He said this contravened traffic regulations and threatened food security. Oladele spoke through the Ogere Unit Commander, Maxwell Lede, at the joint inter-command public enlightenment organised by the Sagamu and Ogere commands. The programme, with the theme: “Way forward towards improved safe motoring”,  was held at A. A. Rano Truck Park at Ogere, on Lagos/Ibadan Expressway. According to him, the enlightenment was part of efforts to stem overloading and excesses of truck drivers who load foodstuff on their truck. Lede thanked A. A. Rano for its support and urged it to take steps to curb the menace. He urged the company’s management to continue to organise.
