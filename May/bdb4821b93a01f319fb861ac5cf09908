Ekiti State Governor Ayo Fayose has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of plotting to rig the July 14 governorship election in connivance with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Addressing reporters in his office Fayose alleged that APC and INEC had struck a deal to disenfranchise 50 per cent of the electorate by “heavily preloading the smart card readers.” He alleged that thousands of voters would be disenfranchised in Ikere-Ekiti, the hometown of the People’s Demoratic Party (PDP) candidate Prof. Kolapo Olusola, and Ado-Ekiti, the hometown of his running mate, Mr. Ayodeji Ogunsakin. Fayose alleged that the APC has been distributing what he called fake empowerment forms to lure voters. He said: “It has come to our attention that the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ekiti State has devised another sinister plot to disenfranchise thousands of eligible voters in areas considered as strongholds of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), particular my where the PDP standard bearer comes from , which is Ikere-Ekiti.
