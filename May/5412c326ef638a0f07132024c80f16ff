An Ikeja High Court yesterday declined to grant two Managing Directors (MDs) – Samuel Okeke of Samadores Ltd and Aqua Rock Real Estate, and Ifeanyi Ndigwe of Iccon Communications Ltd bail. It described them as flight risks in rejecting their bail request. Justice Mojisola Dada rejected their applications following opposition from the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). Okeke, Ndigwe, Forthright Properties Ltd, MD Isaac Akintoye, and four firms are standing trial for an alleged N120 million property scam. In her ruling, the judge observed that the EFCC’s claim Okeke jumped administrative bail, and that Ndigwe had no verifiable address, were not controverted. Justice Dada held: “The first defendant’s (Okeke’s) bail was opposed by the prosecution on the ground that he jumped the administrative bail granted him at the EFCC office and evaded arrest until he was apprehended on May 10. The applicant’s counsel never replied to this weighty allegation in all the documents submitted before the court. I therefore hold that his application fails and bail is hereby refused.” In rejecting the third defendant’s (Ndigwe’s) application, the judge held: “…not having a source of income or a traceable address, there are indications that he may not be available for his trial.” The judge, however, granted Akintoye N500,000 bail with one surety in the like sum. Justice Dada adjourned till June 8. On May 15, the defendants pleaded “not guilty” to a 16-count charge of stealing and fraud. According to EFCC counsel Muhammed Bashir, the offences were committed in Lagos between November 14, 2005 and August 2014. The defendants allegedly received sums totaling N120million in tranches of N68,400,000, N1,800,000, N5,000,000, N6,000,000, N10,000,000, and N8,500,000, among others. Okeke and his firms were indicted in counts 1 to 12, Akintoye and his firm were mentioned in count 12; Ndigwe and his company appeared in counts 13 to 16.
