The council’s Information Officer, Alhaji Abullahi Yakubu said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday in Dutse. NAN reports that the five-day exercise, which began on Saturday, is currently being conducted across the 27 local government areas of the state. Yakubu said the council had received a total of 72,000 doses of Oral Polio Vaccines (OPVs) from the state government for the successful conduct of the exercise. He explained that the council had also provided light refreshment to woo children to participate in the exercise. He also quoted the council’s Head of Health Education, Alhaji Sule Shehu, as saying that the council had earlier mobilised District Heads of Miga and Zareku communities on the need to ensure that their subjects participate in the exercise. According to him, the council also engaged 34 religious focal persons to sensitise people on the need to participate in the exercise. The council commended members of vigilante group, Hisbah, Jama’atu Nasril Islam and school teachers in the area for their support towards the successful conduct of the exercise. (NAN)
