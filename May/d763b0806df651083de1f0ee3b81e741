For the third time the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Ibrahim Idris, failed to appear to brief the Senate on wild spread killings in the country and alleged ill-treatment of embattled Senator representing Kogi West, Dino Melaye. It would be recalled that Senate President, Bukola Saraki on Monday reported the refusal by the Inspector General of Police, Ibrahim Idris to appear before the Senate. The Senate had recently invited the IGP twice over the arrest of Senator Dino Melaye but he failed to show up before the Senate in plenary. Saraki after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari recently had said that there was need to ensure IGP respect constituted authority in line with the provisions of the 1999. He said “Just talking about the issue of the police, we also raised the issue of the non-appearance of the IG at the Senate and felt that they must continue to ensure that he continues to apply obedience to the issue of constituted authority.”
