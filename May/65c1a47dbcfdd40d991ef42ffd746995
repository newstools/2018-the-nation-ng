Describing the theme of the summit entitled: “Lagos State Vision on Education and Health in Relations to the sustainable Goals”, as apt, Governor Ambode said that the sectors determine the human capital development index of any nation. “An educated and healthy population is a great asset that can contribute effectively to wealth creation.  Great nations are not made by the quality of natural resources they are endowed with but by the quality of their human capital. In the last three years, our administration has invested heavily in the education sector to ensure that no child is left behind irrespective of their parent’s and economic status.” The Governor assured that as a measure of premium placed on the two sectors and in line with his administration’s commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, he said he would ensure that plans for the two sectors are implemented. On her par, the state’s the Head of Service, Mrs Folasade Adesoye,  said that it was crucial that education and health policies are simultaneously addressed and better coordinated to maximise gains of both sectors. She added that the state has continued to be foremost state in the federation in term of growth and development, describing the forum as one of the key strengths.
