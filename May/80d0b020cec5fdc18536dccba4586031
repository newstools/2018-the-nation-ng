United States President, Donald Trump, has said there is a “very substantial chance” a historic summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-un next month may not happen. He said the North must meet conditions for the summit to go ahead though if it did not, it might happen “later.” Trump was speaking as he received South Korea’s President, Moon Jae-in, at the White House, the BBC reports. The North has said it may cancel the summit if the U.S insists on it giving up nuclear weapons unilaterally. Mr. Trump did not say what conditions the U.S had set for the summit but, asked by a reporter about the North’s arsenal, he said “denuclearisation must take place.” The June 12 summit is due to take place in Singapore. It follows a summit between the two Korean leaders in April. North Korea is expected to dismantle a nuclear test site this week as a good will gesture but the demolition may be delayed by bad weather. .
