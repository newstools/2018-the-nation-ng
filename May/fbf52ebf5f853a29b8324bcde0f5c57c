The video message had an accompanying message dished out in Frenchcourtesy @leopard243. “Merci @thenff @NGSuperEagles  et bon courage pour la @fifaworldcup_fr  (“Thanks @thenff@NGSuperEagles  and good luck for @fifaworldcup_en The two teams played out a 1-1 draw in the match that attracted a lot of sports administrators including CAF President Ahmad Ahmad. Although soccer fans in the country appreciated the match which gave them an opportunity to see some of the players in the 30-man provisional squad that have not been tested, many condemned the pitch which they say is not worthy of being used to test the capacity of a world cup bound team, adding that it was by the grace of God that no player cubed injury in the very poor pitch.  Eagles will next take on Harry Kane captained Three lions June 2nd at the Wembley. The final shape up match will be against Czech Rupublic in June 6 in Austria.  Coach of the side Gernot Rohr is expected to name his final 23 man list on Wednesday.  Nigeria will open shop in Russia against Croatia on June 16 followed by a clash against Iceland before taking on perennial rivals Argentina in the last group stage  match.
