Residents of Ajuwon in Ifako Ijaiye Local Government Area of Lagos State have appealed to the government for the removal of a bulldozer abandoned in the entrance of Shoyebi close, since 2013. The Nation gathered that the bulldozer was abandoned, after a construction company completed the road project in the area since 2013. A resident, Pastor Babatunde Egbeyemi, said a letter had been written to the Community Development Association (CDA), which claimed that it was working on the issue. He lamented that residents and others could not access the close with their vehicles. “The Lagos state government constructed the road; they must call the contractor to order and get the bulldozer off the road,” he said. Another resident, Michael Amao, called on the construction company to remove the bulldozer. He explained that leaving the bulldozer is risky, noting that in case of emergency, no vehicle can come for rescue. “If there is fire in the close for example, no truck can gain access into the close because the bulldozer has blocked the entrance. There is just a little portion that we have to pass through the close. The space is narrow and there is a gutter by the side, which children can fall into.” Lamenting that leaving their vehicles on other streets was not safe, Amao said. “When we park our cars on other streets, we not only have to walk distance to our houses, we also park the cars at our own risk because they are not within our line of sight.” Emmanuel Ogeh said residents had been parking their vehicles on the road side in the past five years. “The bulldozer is obstructing us from driving into Shoyebi close; we have to always park our vehicles on other streets which are quite distance from us. The landlord association in the area has also told us that they are working on it but the road is still blocked. We want the government to act urgently and come to our rescue,” he said.
