The accused are Ayodele Oluwafemi, 36; Imole Otegbeye, 22; Segun Sunday, 24; Rilwan Abdusalam, 22; and Ezekiel Ayodele, 22. The men, whose addresses were not provided, are facing a three-count charge bordering on robbery and unlawful possession of firearms. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs A. A.

She directed that the case file should be duplicated and a copy sent to the DPP. The prosecution had earlier told the court that the accused committed the offences on May 3 at 10.00 p. m. along Oshodi Airport Road, Lagos. The Police Prosecutor, Insp.

The offences contravened Sections 297(2), 299(1) and 330 (a), (d) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Reports have it that Section 297 (2) prescribes 21 years jail term for offenders. The magistrate adjourned the case until July 2 DPP’s advice.
