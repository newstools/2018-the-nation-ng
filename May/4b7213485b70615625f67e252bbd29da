As a way of enhancing the effectiveness of the front desk managers, Marcforte Consulting is organizing a two-day programme for front desk managers. The programme comes between  May 15 and16. According to Marcforte Marcforte Business Consulting Limited, since front desk is the first and sometimes the last official point of contact in any organization, the impression formed about it can make or mar such an organization. The programme is designed to address the challenging role of the front office as well as industry best practices for managing the front desk. Also, May 16 to18 will be used to train participants in polishing diction, pronunciation and eloquence. Explaining  the reason for the programme, Corporate Communications Executive at Marcforte Marcforte Business Consulting , David Oladosu, said the inadequacies of many in his area necessitated the programme. “We have discovered that those who articulate well and speak clearly often find that success comes easily. After all, being able to communicate impeccably is one of the ways to showcase one’s level of intelligence. “Marcforte’s programme on polishing diction, pronunciation and eloquence is designed to help participants perfect the enunciation of certain English sounds in order to enhance speech and attain erasure of all forms of regional or mother-tongue interferences. Oladosu said “good diction isn’t about changing your accent or personality. It’s about speaking with clarity; erasure of all forms of regional or mother-tongue interferences; improved confidence and assurance to speak in public; improved vocabulary as learning new words comes with the practice sessions; strengthened vocal muscles as a result of intensive practice sessions and tongue twisting; improved reading and clarity skills.
