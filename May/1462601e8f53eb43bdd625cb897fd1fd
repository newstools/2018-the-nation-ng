The Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics ( ASUP ), Federal Polytechnic, Nasarawa, Nasarawa State, says it will embark on mechanised farming to boost its revenue base and the nation’s food production. Dr. Yusuf Husseini, the Chairman of the chapter, said this today in an interview with our reporter. Husseini said that the union having a farm would go a long way in improving on its revenue base and also help in enhancing the nation’s food security. He disclosed that the union was also planning to devise other ways of showering up its revenue base in order to reduce dependence on the union members’ dues for its activities. “We want to have an ASUP farm because we have vast land here. We want to embark on mechanised farming by God grace for our members’ benefit,” he said. Husseini urged Nigerians to embrace farming in order to boost food production and grow the country’s economy, adding that no society could live comfortably without agriculture. He reiterated his commitment to embarking on projects and programmes that would have direct impact on the lives of the union members and students for the overall development of the institution.
