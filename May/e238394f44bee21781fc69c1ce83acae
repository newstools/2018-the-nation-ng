Former Ekiti State Deputy Governor Sikiru Lawal yesterday emerged as the flag bearer of the Labour Party (LP) for the July 14 governorship poll. Lawal was adopted by affirmation at the state congress of the party held in Ado-Ekiti, the state capital. He promised to transform Ekiti through a four-point agenda agenda: “AWEH,” which incorporates Agriculture, Wealth Creation, Education and Health Services. Lawal promised to empower the youths by conceding 30 per cent of political appointments to them to enable them contribute meaningfully to governance. The LP candidate said he was not intimidated by money politics, adding that Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) financial war chest will fail at the election. He said: “We are set to bring the real change to Ekiti. I know that our politics is monetized but money will fail these corrupt politicians on July 14. “Apart from salary payments, I will take care of our elders by putting in place effective safety nets to take care of our elderly, promote welfare of our students and make our women relevant in their homes. “I see no reason why a government should be owing nine months salary arrears in a state that is poor and depend on civil service. “Our teachers, civil servants and local government staff should not miss this opportunity to elect one of them in this election.”
