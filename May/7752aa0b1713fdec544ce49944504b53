The Ayangburen of Ikorodu, Oba Kabiru Shotobi, yesterday denied issuing statement ordering women to stay indoor during today’s Oro Day. A letter signed by the monarch to the Ikorodu Town Hall Management Board Chairman, entitled MAGBO FESTIVAL 2018 on April 23 reads in part: “This is to notify you of the above-mentioned festival which is slated for Tuesday 8th May 2018, according to tradition, all female are forbidden to be seen outside their homes or move around the town on this date which is Oro Day.” Police Commissioner Imohimi Edgal in a statement by police spokesman Chike Oti quoted Oba Shotobi as saying that “it is unthinkable for a man with his level of exposure to do or say anything that would be seen as discriminatory against the female gender.” The monarch, Edgal said, “however, acknowledged that the festival is an age long tradition of Ikorodu people which had been even before he was born. He added that the festival would hold without denying the female folks their right to freedom of movement.” Oba Shotobi spoke at a meeting called by Edgal with Palace Chiefs and the Commissioner for Local government and Chieftaincy affairs Alhaji Muslim Folami. Edgal warned that the command will not tolerate any discriminatory tradition against the female gender. The command, he said, would deal ruthlessly with anybody who hides under the guise of custom or tradition to foment trouble in the state. The police chief enjoined women to go about their lawful business without let or hindrance. “The meeting ended with a joint press statement assuring the people of Ikorodu that the festival would be peaceful,” Edgal said.
