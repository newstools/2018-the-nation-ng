The Presidency has commenced the vetting of the details of the 2018 Budget bill passed as the National Assembly. The lawmakers passed a budget of N9,120,334,988,225 for the current fiscal year, more than six months after it was presented to them by President Muhammadu Buhari. The President submitted a proposal of N8.6trillion to the National Assembly. But it was learnt that there was one issue surrounding the budget which had not been resolved by the two arms of government. Although the Presidency reluctantly accepted the National Assembly’s proposal to increase the budget benchmark from $45 per barrel to $51, there was no consensus on what to do with the excess cash. While the National Assembly wanted the $6 increase to go into expenditure, the Presidency proposed that it should be used to reduce budget deficit. A top source said: “Following more demands by MDAs, the National Assembly approached the Presidency on the need to increase the benchmark. The increase was discussed by the Presidency with the principal officers of the legislature. “But the Presidency was more disposed to reducing the budget deficit or to narrow the gap in deficit. The National Assembly sought for more funds for expenditure. “The two arms agreed on increase in benchmark but there was no consensus on what to use it for.” Another source in government said: “The Presidency will spend the next few days to study the budget details before assent by the President. We want to be sure that the estimates passed were mostly in line with the projections submitted and adjustments mutually agreed upon. “The decision on how to deal with the budget, especially the consideration of the details, will be taken on Monday. “So, from Monday, we will know where we are going.” When contacted, the Senior Special Assistant to the President on National Assembly Matters, Sen. Ita Enang, said: “The next step is that the bill will undergo standard presidential operational procedure. “This is the procedure every bill undergoes before assent by President Muhammadu Buhari.” The National Assembly passed a budget of N9,120,334,988,225 for the 2018 fiscal year.
