Donatus Agu-Ejidike, the new Chairman of Anambra Karate Association, has urged Â members of the association to come up with ideas that could develop the sport beyond its present level in the state. Agu-Ejidike made this disclosure in a statement in Lagos on Wednesday. He said that during his tenure as chairman, he would give karate a new face and re-branding that would bring more fame to the state. Agu-Ejidike said that he would use his network to woo sponsors in order to promote karate and other sports in the state. The chairman explained that the board at its inaugural meeting in Awka, had agreed to work together as a team and eschew sentiment that might divide the board members. He said the board was committed to feature karate players in all national championships and embrace grassroots competitions ranging from school sports to wards and Local Government Areas. The chairman lauded the governor of Anambra for considering him and other members for the assignment. Agu-Ejidike said that they would not betray the confidence reposed in them to develop karate in the state. The newsmen recall that Anambra emerged the overall winner at the 2017 Karate National Championship held in Abuja. The association is made up of eight members spread across the zones in the state. NAN
