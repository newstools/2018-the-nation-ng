Some traders and residents in Ikorodu, Lagos State, have appealed to the custodians of traditional festivals to modify how they are celebrated. In interviews with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), they called for the abolition of those that were gender biased. They said the restriction of women during such celebrations, especially during the day-time always had negative impact on their businesses and movements. Mrs Foluke Agunbiade, a tomato-seller at the Sabo Market in Ikorodu said there still existed traditional festivals in the town which restricted the movement of persons, especially, women. “We need to have in place traditional feasts that enhance economic activities and respect for womanhood. “It is not good that we still celebrate traditions that give the impression that one gender is more superior to the other. “It is bad for our development if we still have traditional festivals that violate human rights,’’ she said. Another trader, Mrs Aisha Kareem, who sells fruits at Ojubode area of Ikorodu, said traditions ought not to be anti-social. She added that traditional festivals should not contradict modern tenets of community life. “Cultural festivals should usually enhance trade and commerce as well as other aspects of people’s lives. “Tradition that diminishes human rights is bad and should be done away with,’’ she said. A fish farmer, whose resides at Itaoluwo area of Ikorodu, Mr Jonathan Egunjobi, said that “our traditions should not portray us as being anti-progress. “Any traditional feast that is anti-modern and did not uphold human rights should be reformed. “In fact, festivities that particularly erode raising the dignity of women must, of necessity, be made better.’’ Women’s movements were restricted in some parts of Ikorodu recently following the announcement that the town wanted to celebrate one of its traditional festivals.
