The Southeast Political Summit (SEPS) has urged Ndigbo not to boycott the 2019 general election. It said this would enable them occupy the political space meant for them. The group’s leader, Mrs. Eberechukwu Anigbogu, told  a news conference in Enugu that the apathy, cultural surrender and political ignorance that ravaged Igbo land in the last 20 years had made Ndigbo spectators. She said: “We have decided that it is time to sensitise and mobilise our people to rise up and occupy our political space. “We are not a party. SEPS is not another political pressure group. It is rather a mass movement geared towards re-inventing political consciousness in Southeast.” According to her, there is a burden placed on SEPS members to chart a new course for Ndigbo. Anigbogu recalled that pristine Igbo society operated the best democracy the world ever knew, stressing that in those days, people gathered at town squares to deliberate. She noted that at such meeting, families, clans, age grades and elders picked the most trusted and virtuous to represent them.
