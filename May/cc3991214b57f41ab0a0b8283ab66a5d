Nigeria born cruiser-weight boxer, Lawrence Okolie will face Luke Watkins for the Commonwealth and World Boxing Association (WBA) Continental titles at York Hall, London on June 6. The fight, the latest instalment of the JDNXTGEN series, will be Okolie’s first title defence since he beat Isaac Chamberlain in their grudge match, to win the WBA belt in February and hopes to add Watkins’ Commonwealth title. “I am very excited to be challenging for the Commonwealth title. I have got one belt to my name, and I want to keep on collecting honours, this is the next step”, said Okolie. “The Commonwealth title is something I visualised winning even back as an amateur. To win it in a Commonwealth Games year cycle would make it even more special. The atmosphere at York Hall will be mad; I think it will help make it a toe-to-toe war as the fans are right on top of you — it should make for a great night of boxing.” The 25-year-old Rio Olympian also admitted that he had been studying Watkins recently and has respect for his unbeaten record and style. Both boxers are unbeaten, with Okolie having six knockouts from eight fights, while 28-year-old Watkins has nine knockouts from 13 matches.
