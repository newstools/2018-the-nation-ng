The  Speaker said: “This is the third anniversary of the All Progressives Congress  (APC) administration at the centre and I want to commend our people for their support and prayers not only for the government at the centre, but also for the state and local governments. “Yes, things have not been rosy, hence the need for me to commend your courage and perseverance. Our people have been so wonderful for their support and prayers. “However, I want to assure you that very soon, you will start to reap the dividends of the socio-economic reforms of the government. “At the state level, there’s is no doubt that Lagosians are enjoying positive dividends of democracy with massive infrastructure and human development programmes anchored on people-oriented policies backed by rightly-guided legislation.”
