Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has said some areas under its operational territory would start experiencing power outage from this week. The company, in a statement by its General Manager, Corporate Communications, Godwin Idemudia, attributed the power outage to technical maintenance work being carried out by Transmission Company of Nigeria (TCN) some facilities belonging to the power transmission company from which Eko DisCo distribution injection sub-stations servicing the affected areas receive bulk energy load. The areas to be affected by the power outage include Apapa, Amuwo, Festac, Ojo, Okokomaiko, and Ijanikin. Others include Iba, Agbara, Badagry, Ibeju, Ajah and their adjoining areas. While apologising for the inconvenience the power outage would cause EKEDC customers, the statement further appealed to customers to bear with the situation, adding that the outage was beyond its control as the facilities being worked on wholly belong to Transmission Company of Nigeria which is a completely autonomous body. The statement, however, added that enough assurance had been received from TCN that the facility maintenance work would be expedited to ensure restoration of normal power supply to all affected areas in good time.
