Rave singer Davido and his much talked about girlfriend, Chioma were at the Dunes Center Shopping Mall, Abuja, yesterday for the signing of her new cooking show which he teased about a couple of days back. Recall that the OBO crooner recently dropped a subtle hint on Instagram that he was contacted for a contract for Chef Chi worth N60M, but he insisted on N100M. Apparently the deal has been signed, although it is not clear how much was involved. He wrote: “Today we signed a strategic Partnership and sponsorship contract with Dunes Center Abuja @dunesAbuja for “The Chef Chi Show” First endorsement and cooking show. Congratulations to Chef Chi (Chioma). “Who’s ready for @thechefchi cooking show???!!! #NewdealAlert powered by Dunes @dunesabuja … coming to a screen near you!!! I don turn manager oo.” Recall that recently, the singer stirred public discussions when he reportedly bought a porsche car for his girlfriend as birthday gift. He also followed that up with the release of a single, “Assurance’ which has gained appreciable listenership. At the signing of the contract was Triple MG boss, Ubi Franklin among others.
