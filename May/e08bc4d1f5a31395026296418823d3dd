TO achieve the 90-90-90 initiative by 2030, and ensure an AIDS-free Lagos, the Lagos State AIDS Control Agency (LSACA) screened over 700 workers on May Day. The event held at the Agege Stadium, Lagos. LSACA Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Dr. Oluseyi Temowo said the  Workers’ Day presented another opportunity to screen a large number of people for HIV because workers form a huge component of residents in the state. Temowo said the Day served a dual purpose – awareness campaign and screening opportunity, because workers have many tentacles- family, friend, and relations and can further the message on HIV to these ones as well. “We have been able to update them on the new developments on screening and awareness on HIV/AIDS, including knowing their right- everyone in the state must know his status by 2010.’’ If confirmed positive, same will be placed on drugs, freely; to obtain a viral suppression. That will ensure eradication of new HIV infection by year 2030.
