The Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, has said speedy approvals of Field Development Plan (FDP) by the Federal Government will attract huge investments into the oil and gas sector. Kachikwu disclosed this while delivering a keynote address at a technical symposium on Field Development Plan (FDP) approval process, organised by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) Lagos section 61, in Lagos. The minister, who was represented by the Senior Technical Adviser in the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Mr. Johnson Awoyemi, said FDP was one of the fundamental criteria in the development of upstream exploration and production projects in Nigeria. He noted that the symposium  was not only apt, but very timely, adding that SPE serves as a platform for promoting and disseminating technical knowledge and advice to government on policy initiatives regarding the development and production of oil and gas resources. According to him, the government is ever ready to partner any creativity on the part of SPE that will add value and enhance economic sustainability along the oil and gas value chain. He said it is important that government acts quickly to evaluate and approve FDPs, thereby, ensuring that investors’ momentum does not dip, adding that some of the main issues that have resulted in approvals delay are the inadequacy or incompleteness of plans that do not address all the project development issues. He said: “Hence, as part of our 7 Big Wins, we initiated the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP) as a solution. The purpose of the NGFCP is to eliminate wastage of gas, thereby, stimulating economic growth, driving investments and providing jobs in the nation through the use of widely available innovative technologies.“
