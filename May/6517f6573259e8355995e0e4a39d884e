The nominations are selected by BET’s Voting Academy, which comprises fans and an esteemed group of entertainment professionals in the fields of television, film, music, social media, digital marketing, sports journalism, public relations, and the creative arts. The BET awards are voted for by the public with an interest in all genres made by black people. Voting closes on June 1, and the show will air live on BET on June 24 from the Microsoft Theatre, Los Angeles, California, United States.
