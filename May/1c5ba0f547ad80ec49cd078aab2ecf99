The Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) is to embark on aggressive enforcement of the Employees Compensation Scheme (ECS). Its Managing Director, Adebayo Somefun, made this known at an induction for the Fund’s staff members in Ibadan region. Somefun urged workers to redouble their efforts to ensure the success of the scheme, describing the ECS as a scheme which puts smiles on the faces of employees that sustain injuries in the course of their work. “There was a need to be diligent about enforcement to ensure that employers key into the desires of the scheme,” he said. Somefun explained that before the advent of the ECS, workers were left on their own when they sustain injury in the workplace. He, however, said with the coming of ECS, workers now give their best knowing that when they sustain injury, there is a scheme that will take the burden off them. “That is why in the last seven years since this scheme began, there has been steady rise in workers’ productivity because workers now execute their tasks without holding back or afraid of injury. Not only that, the ECS also takes care of the families of workers that die in the course of work,” he added. Somefun, however, said the aggressive enforcement of the ECS was not to intimidate organisations, but to make them comply with the provisions of the law. “The ECS is a product of the law. The law specified that every organisation must make provision for the safety of its workers. The ECS is a one-stop-shop for workers’ safety in the workplace because not just that NSITF sits and wait till accident happens before it acts; we provide safety guidelines that reduce risks at the workplace. “NSITF exposes organisations to simple and cost effective safety steps that can reduce accidents in the workplace,” he explained.
