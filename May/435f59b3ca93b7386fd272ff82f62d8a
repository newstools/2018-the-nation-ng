The Federal High Court in Lagos on Monday sentenced Okonkwo Chukwuma and Bankole Johnson (alias Rotimi Adekunle) to two-year imprisonment for importing 220 grams of cocaine. Justice Hadiza Rabiu-Shagari held that the prosecution proved its case against the duo beyond reasonable doubt. The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) arrested the convicts on July 27 last year at the Marina Post Office on Lagos Island, where they went to receive the banned drug. Prosecuting counsel, Adekunle Adebanjo, said the offence was punishable under Section 11(a) of the NDLEA Act of 2014. The convicts had pleaded not guilty to the charge following which Adebanjo called six witnesses and tendered the banned drug, the convicts’ statements and a laboratory test result. Justice Rabiu-Shagari said: “The prosecution has been able to prove its case against the defendants. They are hereby pronounced guilty as charged and hereby convicted.”
