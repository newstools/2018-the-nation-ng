The former Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Caretaker Committee, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, on Tuesday lauded Nigerians workers for their perseverance despite the deteriorating socio-economic conditions in the country. Makarfi, in a May Day message signed by his media aide, Murktar Sirajo, urged the workers to continue to work towards creating a better tomorrow for all Nigerians. He rejoiced with all Nigerian workers on the occasion of the 2018 Workers’ Day, stating that “labour, as the engine which runs any nation’s life-support system, certainly deserves to be appreciated, celebrated and feted on this day.” The statement reads: “The Senator joins compatriots in saluting Nigerian workers’ consistent courage, dedication and perseverance in the service of society and appeals to them to use this day to reflect on how much more they can contribute to nation-building. Countries are only as efficient, fit and strong as their workforce is. “Senator Makarfi also shares in the deep disappointment with the deteriorating socio-economic conditions under which our workers and majority of Nigerians live and work today but also urges that we all persevere and continue to work towards creating a better tomorrow.”
