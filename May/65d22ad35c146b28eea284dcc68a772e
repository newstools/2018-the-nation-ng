Vice-chancellor (VC) of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), Prof Oluwatoyin Ogundipe, has said God, not him, is in charge of the institution. The VC spoke on Sunday while delivering a sermon at the university’s chapter of the Redeemed Christian Fellowship held at Tolulope Odugbemi Hall. The theme of Ogundipe’s sermon was: You shall not be wasted. The VC said God had been the one administering the institution since he took over from his predecessor last year. The professor of Botany said he was only an instrument of God, noting that activities in the institution under him were never his own initiative but directives from God. Ogundipe, however, advised students to acknowledge God in their daily activities, saying failure to do so could lead to wasted efforts. He said: “Wasted life could either be physical or psychological or in relation to a wasted time. But in proper perspective, when you don’t know God, you are living a wasted life. There are some people that their education is wasted. Whether you are a professor or a VC, if you don’t know God, your education is wasted.” The VC, who prophesied that no life shall be wasted under him, urged the students not to join the company of friends living wasted lives. Ogundipe succeeded Prof Rahmon Bello and became the 12th VC last November. Before his appointment, he was the Deputy Vice-Chancellor for Academics and Research.
