The management of University College Hospital (UCH), Ibadan, said on Wednesday that an unidentified man deliberately jumped down from the sixth floor of the hospital. Mr Deji Bobade, the Public Relations Officer of the hospital, confirmed the incident to our reporter in Ibadan. He said the man purposely went to the floor where the museum was under lock and jumped down in an attempt to commit suicide. “As we all know, the JOHESU strike is on and no health worker was allowed to be at work. “At around 9 am, people around the ground floor of the building said they just heard the thud sound of a heavy object. “On getting to the place, the body of a man, probably in his late 50s or early 60s, was found on the ground. “ Doctors around certified him dead. “We contacted the Police Public Relations Officer, Adekunle Ajisebutu, who ordered his men to deposit the body in our mortuary here. “There was no means of identification found on him but his footwear was a “dunlop’’ rubber slippers,’’ he said. Efforts by our correspondent to get the police to shed more light on the incident proved abortive as Ajisebutu failed to pick his calls. He also did not respond to a text sent to his phone.
